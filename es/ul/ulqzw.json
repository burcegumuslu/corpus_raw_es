This will be my last contribution that I \nwrite as Director, as on March 2023 Paola Bovolenta has \nbeen designated CBM Director, after being elected by the \nCBM General Board (Claustro Cientifico) and proposed by the \nGoverning Board (Junta de Gobierno). \nIn 2021-2022 we have started to see the fruits of the work \ncarried out in the past few years, thanks to the changes in \nthe scientific organization and the recruitment of promising \nscientists, young PIs as well as senior consolidated groups, \nadding their expertise in state-of-the-art technological and \nscientific approaches. We have seen a significant improvement \nin research outputs in terms of high-quality publications as well \nas in fund-raising, with several relevant EU-funded and national \nand regional grants obtained.  Scientific projects focused in the \nCOVID19 pandemics have continued during these two years, \nadding to the knowledge of the biology of the virus, its airborne \ndetection, immune response generated and the development \nof diagnostic and potential treatment strategies. One of our \nresearchers coordinates the CSIC Interdisciplinary Thematic \nPlatform known as Global Health Platform against COVID-19 \npandemic. The Genomics facility has been performing diagnostic \nPCRs for COVID19 for CSIC personnel, in collaboration with CSIC \nOccupational Health Service.\nLourdes Ruiz\nCBM Director7\nCBM 2021-2022Of note, and closely related to the COVID19 pandemics and the development of new vaccines, several \nCBM researchers have been very active in science dissemination and communication to the lay public \nin mass media and have received prestigious awards for this activity. Also, in 2022, we launched a \nspecific science communication event with the support of Comunidad de Madrid, \u201cCiencia Contigo\u201d, \ncarried out at the Residencia de Estudiantes in Madrid, that was highly successful in terms of the \nnumber of attendees and the feedback and comments in social media.\nWe have continued with our strong commitment to training, exemplified by the more than 48 \npredoctoral students who defended their PhD Thesis with the highest marks in 2021-22, 65 Master \nThesis and more than 100 Final Degree Projects carried out supervised by CBM researchers. A total \nof 147 seminars and conferences by prestigious national and international researchers have taken \nplace in these two years.\nIn 2021 the CBM Equality Working Group was established and, working in close contact with CSIC \nand UAM Equality Committees, carried out specific dissemination and other activities to ensure and \nfoster inclusiveness and equal opportunities for all in CBM activities. As a result of this, CBM received \nthe CSIC Equality Distinction Award 2021. \nI would also like to mention that CBM researchers have received different awards in this period, \nunderlying those granted to young researchers, as is the case of the National Research Award \n\u201cGabriela Morreale\u201d, in Medicine and Health Sciences granted to Mar\u00eda Llorens and the \u201cMargarita \nSalas Award\u201d from Comunidad de Madrid granted to Ana Ortega. \nFinally, thanks to the excellent research outputs, and a very well-defined strategic plan for the next \nfour years, focused on the Interplay among Immunity, Inflammation and Metabolism (I3M), CBM \nobtained the recognition as Severo Ochoa Centre of Excellence in the 2021 Call, with Paola Bovolenta \nas Scientific Director. This represents an excellent opportunity for the CBM to consolidate a leading \nposition in the Spanish research landscape, which I am confident will be achieved. All the proposed \nactions and the commitment and excellent work of researchers and personnel in scientific and \ntechnical services undoubtedly ensure success in this aim.\nI have had the privilege of serving the CBM as Director for the past four years. I had never anticipated \nthat I would one day be Director when I completed my PhD research in this centre (a too long time \nago!). I have always been aware of the scientific excellence of the CBM, but during these years I \nhave had the opportunity to realize the complexity and the impressive efficiency of the scientific, \ntechnical, administrative and management staff in carrying out \u201chousekeeping\u201d activities, that allow \ninvestigators to perform their research and attain their scientific objectives.\nI would like to thank all the many people who have helped me along, each in their own corresponding \nsphere of activity and responsibility, with special thanks to the Vice-director Jaime Mill\u00e1n.  I am \ngrateful to have had this time serving as Director and I am excited with the prospect of continuing \nto be part of the CBM community going forward.\nLourdes Ruiz \nCBM Director8\nCBM 2021-2022\nIn Memoriam\nIN MEMORIAM \nPROF. JUAN MODOLELL (1937-2023)  \nOn February 28th, 2023, Juan Modolell, ad \nhonorem Professor of Research of the \nSpanish National Research Council (CSIC), \npassed away in Madrid at age 85. Juan was \nborn in Barcelona in 1937. He obtained two \nbachelor\u2019s degrees: in Biological Sciences \n(Universidad de Barcelona, 1959) and in \nBiochemistry (Universidad de La Laguna, \n1962). He attained a PhD in Biochemistry \nfrom Ohio State University in 1966. \nAfterwards, he made a successful post-doc \nat Prof. Bernard Davis\u00b4 lab (Harvard Medical \nSchool), studying the inhibition of protein \nbiosynthesis by the antibiotic streptomycin. \nJuan came back to Spain in 1970 to join the \nlaboratory of Prof. David Vazquez, at the \n\u201cCentro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas\u201d, \nobtained a second PhD in Chemical Sciences \n(Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 1971) \nand soon after, became a staff member of \nthe CSIC. In 1977, he moved to the recently \nfounded \u201cCentro de Biolog\u00eda Molecular \nSevero Ochoa\u201d (CBMSO) where he has been \nan active member for the rest of his life. \nJuan made landmark discoveries in two unrelated fields of work, Escherichia coli  protein \nbiosynthesis and Drosophila melanogaster  Developmental Biology. His early work described \nthe mechanisms of interaction of aminoacyl-tRNA and the elongation factors EF-G and \nEFTu with the ribosome. He also determined the stoichiometry of ribosomal translocation \nand revealed the mode of action of several antibiotics that specifically inhibit bacterial \nprotein synthesis. \n9\nCBM 2021-2022Juan was an established researcher in the biosynthesis of proteins field when, it 1980, \nhe made a risky transition to start working in Drosophila  Developmental Biology. After \na fruitful conversation with Antonio Garc\u00eda-Bellido, Juan embarked on the analysis of \npattern formation, namely, to discover the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying \nthe formation of the pattern of bristles that cover the thorax of the adult Drosophila . Juan \nand his group pioneered the use of Molecular Biology techniques to clone and functionally \ncharacterize the genes of the achaete-scute complex, whose expression confer to epidermal \ncells the ability to become neural precursors and, accordingly, coined for them the term \n\u201cproneural genes\u201c. The key role of the achaete/scute genes in the patterning of the thoracic \nbristles relies in their spatially and temporally restricted pattern of expression in the wing \nimaginal disc, since bristle precursors are selected from among the clusters of cells that \nexpress achaete/scute. Furthermore, Juan\u00b4 s team demonstrated that the expression of these \ngenes depends on the activity of enhancer elements, which drive their transcription at precise \npositions of the wing disc and reinforce it in the neural precursors. Remarkably, these were \nones of the firsts position specific enhancers characterized in the Drosophila  genome. \nLater, Juan\u00b4s group succeeded in the characterization of genes that control achaete-scute \nexpression acting through those enhancers (the prepattern genes), or regulate the activity \nof the proneural proteins. These discoveries were paradigmatic since they stablished how \nhierarchical gene activity leads to the generation of morphological patterns and pave the \nway to the identification of proneural genes in other organisms, thus demonstrating the \nuniversality of the proneural function. After this pioneering work on pattern formation, he \ncontinued making important contributions to our understating of other developmental \nprocesses in Drosophila  and Xenopus and participated in international initiatives such as \nthe sequencing of the Drosophila  genome.  \nJuan played an important role as mentor of several generations of researchers, which \nhe considered his second family, and was always eager to receive visiting scientists that \nbenefited from the know-how and the excellent scientific environment of Juan\u00b4s lab at \nthe CBMSO. He was also a great listener to all who approaches him seeking for advice \nand guidance. The scientific community has lost an extraordinary colleague, brilliant, \ngenerous, and forward-thinking. We will never forget him.\nSonsoles Campuzano10\nCBM 2021-2022\nProgram DirectorsBOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGER\nLourdes Ruiz Desviat\nCBM  Director\nCrisanto Gutierrez \nArmenta \nGenome Dynamics\nand Function\nCarlos Dotti\nPhysiological \nand Pathological ProcessesJaime Mill\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez\nCBM  Vice-DirectorPaola Bovolenta \nNicolao\nTissue and Organ\nHomeostasis\nMaria Luisa Toribio \nGarc\u00eda\nInteractions with\nthe Environment\nSonsoles Campuzano Corrales\nDirector of the CBM Equality Committee Germ\u00e1n Lerma Rodrigo\nCBM  Manager\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Esteban Garc\u00eda\nRepresentative of CSIC   \nat the CBM  Scientific \nCommittee\nFederico Mayor Jr\nDirector of the Instituto\nUniversitario de Biolog\u00eda\nMolecular ( UAM )11\nCBM 2021-2022SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD\n \nSCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD                                                              CBMSO 2021-2022  \n\u2022 Chairman:  o   Dr. Matthew Freeman FRS \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n \nSir Willian Dunn School of Pathology \nUniversity of Oxford, Oxford (UK) \n \nmatthew.freeman@path.ox.ac.uk  \n \n\u2022 Dr. Matthias W.

These include the West Nile virus in Sevilla since 2020 and mpox  in 2022. Avian flu and \nMarburg virus are on watch. This national cluster is a virtual institution that proposes advanced solutions \nin the short, medium and long term. Margarita Del Val (CBMSO, CSIC-UAM) and I\u00f1aki Comas (IBV, CSIC) are \nthe scientific Coordinators. The Platform comprises more than 400 researchers from 144 research groups \nfrom different disciplines, representing the wide range of fields of knowledge at CSIC. Areas covered include \nprevention, diagnostic, disease, containment, immunity, antiviral therapies and vaccines, social impact and \ncommunication, connecting human health with animal and environmental health. Focus is strongly oriented \ntowards transferring knowledge, products, procedures and information to society and industry.\n+300 research groups working \ntogether on specialised solutions \nwithin each \ufb01eld\nStudies to unravel the \nvirus\u2019 genome in \npatients, the spread of \nthe pandemic and the \nresponse to the disease\nAvailability of prevention \nequipment and forecasting \nmeasuresTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 \nduring infection\n   Development of a safe \nand e\ufb00ective vaccine\n    Studies for drug \nrepurposing\n    Analysis of new options for \ntherapy and improvement \nof the disease symptomsCOMMUNICATION\nIMPACT\nTREATMENT\nCONTAINMENT\nMEASURESDISEASEPREVENTIO\nNORIGINA 360\u00ba approach \nto contain the virus\nTechnologies and \nproducts to bring \nthe future closerThe participating research groups are \ncarrying out projects which cover every \nfacet of the pandemic: origin, prevention, \ndisease, containment measures, \ntreatment, social impact, and the need to \ncommunicate with society.\nThe most important achievements of PTI \nGlobal Health are delivering short-term and \nmid-term strategies and measures.\nThese will help society and the healthcare \nsystem to better cope with new pressures \narising from the COVID-19 pandemic and to \nmitigate the impact of its progress.The Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), the largest \nresearch institution in Spain, has created Salud Global/Global \nHealth. An Interdisciplinary Thematic Platform (PTI) to provide \nanswers and solutions to every facet of the pandemic.

M Del Val coordinates the Platform and leads \nwork on immunity to infection and vaccination, especially in the very elderly population, to both coronavirus \nand recently mpox . U Bastolla and M Fresno proposed and provided data for a mechanistic association between \nthe severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the differential expression of its receptor protein ACE2 and showed \nthat its expression influences the outcome of infections, especially in children. J Millan focuses on inflammation-\nmediated endothelium damage by SARS-CoV-2. A Alcam\u00ed leads studies on improved detection in aerosols of both \ncoronavirus and recently mpox , especially in education and transportation, and also develops technologies for \ntheir inactivation. L Blanco and M de Vega develop a novel diagnostic method for SARS-CoV-2 infection, based \non the isothermal amplification of specific padlock probes, under protection by a CSIC patent. E Domingo and \nC Perales investigate novel antiviral strategies based on synergic lethal mutagenesis and study virus variability, \nfitness and quasispecies dynamics. Finally, F Sobrino and M Saiz assay the anti-coronavirus activity of cell-\ntargeted drugs as well as synthetic noncoding RNAs in cultured cells and in a COVID-19 mouse model.\nAcknowledgements: The Platform responded to the pressing demand during the coronavirus pandemic, \nsupported and sponsored since March 2020 by donor private Spanish companies.

(2) Developing structure-\naware substitution models of protein evolution for \nphylogenetic inference, with selection on protein \nstructure and on folding stability. (3) Characterizing \nthe relation between chromatin structure and genome \nreplication. (4) Investigating through mathematical \nmethods the ecological interactions between species \nin microbial and general communities. \nAlong line (1), we studied how non-harmonic motions \naffect the normal modes that ground our prediction \nof protein native dynamics. We studied the allosteric \ncouplings and the structural effects of mutations of \nGABA receptors (collaboration with Francisco Zafra\u2019s \ngroup, CBMSO). We also contributed to develop a \nnew method for sampling protein loopsand a new \nmethod for estimating the change of stability due to \nmutations (collaborations with Pablo Chac\u00f3n\u2019s group, \nIQFR-CSIC). Along line (2), we developed the structure \nand stability-constrained substitution model of \nprotein evolution, based on our new predictions of \nthe structural effect of mutations. We showed that it \ngreatly improves evolutionary inference with respect \nto our previous model that only takes into account \nprotein folding stability (https://www.biorxiv.org/\ncontent/10.1101/2023.01.22.525075v1) . Based on this \nprevious model, with Miguel Arenas we found that \nrecombination events and point mutations produce \nsimilar loss of protein folding stability, suggesting \nthat folding does not particularly limit recombination. \nWe developed hybrid protein alignments based on \nsequence and structure similarity, which improve the alignment quality and the estimated divergence time \nwith respect to methods that take into account only \none type of information (https://www.biorxiv.org/\ncontent/10.1101/2023.01.22.525078v1) .\nAlong line (3), in collaboration with Crisanto \nGutierrez\u2019s and Mar\u00eda G\u00f3mez\u2019s groups (CBMSO) \nand Carlos Gonzales (IQFR), we investigated the \nrelationship between repeats of GGN triplets, \ngenome replication origins and chromatin structure \n(nucleosome occupancy and G-quadruplex DNA \nsecondary structure). Along line (4), we studied \nhow different types of ecological interactions \ninfluence the structural stability of mathematical \nmodels of species communities. In collaboration \nwith Fenando Puente, Alberto Pascual, Javier \nTamames and Carlos Pedr\u00f3s (CNB-CSIC), we \ndiscovered a negative relationship between the size \nof bacterial genomes and the number of taxa of the \ncommunity they belong to, hinting at cooperative \nauxotrophic interactions (https://www.biorxiv.org/\ncontent/10.1101/2022.09.11.507163v1) .\nFinally, we proposed a mechanistic association \nbetween the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and \nthe differential expression of its receptor protein \nACE2, which downregulates the inflammatory \npeptides of the Angiotensin-Bradykinin system, \nwhose upregulation in aging, chronic inflammation \nand SARS-CoV-2 infection may play a key role in \ninfection severity. In collaboration with Manuel \nFresno\u2019s group (CBMSO), we showed that the \nexpression of ACE2 influences the probability and \nthe outcome of infections.\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/ubastolla \nhttps://ub.cbm.uam.esGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nUgo Bastolla Bufalini\nPostdoctoral fellow:\nYves Dehouck (until April 2022)\nMaster student\nIvan LorcaCOMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS31\nGenome Decoding Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nB)  Expression of the ACE2 protein in rat lung (horizontal axis) vs. \ncase fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS for humans of same \nsex and age class (vertical axis).

Our research is \naimed at understanding fundamental questions on \ncell proliferation control, transcriptional regulation \nand genome replication in multicellular organisms \nand how epigenetics affects such coordination. To \nthat end, we use the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana \nthat offers the possibility of carrying out molecular, \ncellular, genetic and genomic approaches. Contrary \nto animals, plant development is post-embryonic \nand occurs during the entire life of the organism, \nproviding excellent experimental settings to study \ncell proliferation, arrest and differentiation. \nA major advance has been the generation of \nArabidopsis lines (PlaCCI) expressing three \nfluorescent markers (CDT1a-CFP, H3.1-mCherry and \nCYCB1;1-YFP) that allow the identification of each \ncell cycle phase by unique combinations of colors. \nWe are using these tools to decipher the gene \nnetworks and molecular basis controlling stem cell \nbiology, proliferation of their derivatives and their \ndifferentiation to form a root tip (Fig. 1). We have \nbeen expanding these studies to other organs and \nhow dividing cells communicate with each other. Expanding this project we are interested in learning \nnew pathways controlling the response to different \ntypes of stress in three different avenues. One is \nthe identification of molecular determinants of DNA \nreplication origin (ORI) function. Based on previous \ngenome-wide maps of ORIs and their association \nwith epigenetic marks in 9 chromatin states we are \nexploring the role of individual modifications in ORI \nfunction using CRISPR-dCas9 tools. Another is the \nlink of DNA replication factors in the deposition and \nmaintenance of epigenetic marks and how they \naffect the reprogramming of gene expression in \ngrowth under normal and stress conditions. Finally, \nwe are interested in understanding the relevance \nof chromatin dynamics on the stress response with \nparticular interest in novel histone H3 variants \nspecifically suited to respond to salt and water \ndeficit stress. \nOur studies are ultimately aimed at designing \nstrategies to improve plant growth and performance \nusing pathways not explored so far. \nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nCrisanto Gutierrez\nStaff Scientist:\nB\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Desvoyes\nPostdoctoral fellows:\nJulia Emiliani\nJorge Fung Uceda\nMar\u00eda Sol G\u00f3mez\nAnna Gonz\u00e1lez Gil \n(until September 2022)\nDiego Gomez Martinez \nIvan del Olmo MontoroPredoctoral fellows:\nClara Echevarria Zome\u00f1o \n(until July 2022)\nRoc\u00edo N\u00fa\u00f1ez V\u00e1zquez \nTechnicians:\nElisa Alonso P\u00e9rez\nCarla Alonso Rodriguez \n(until August 2022)\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/crisanto-gutierrez 33\nGenome Decoding Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nCell cycle, endocycle and cell differentiation dynamics in a \ndeveloping Arabidopsis root. \nDoctoral theses\n \u00bbClara Echevarria Zome\u00f1o (2022) Coordination of \ncell proliferation with developmental programs in \nArabidopsis.

Thus, this protein is acting \non fundamental steps of the mRNA life cycle, splicing \nand translation. Gemin5 is organized in functional \ndomains with a distinctive structural organization. \nThe C-terminal region adopts a homodecamer \narchitecture comprised of a dimer of pentamers, \ncritical to bind cognate RNA ligands and to regulate \ntranslation. However, only a fraction of the RNA \ntargets was enriched in polysomes. Two subsets \nof these mRNAs carry unique cis-acting regulatory \nelements, the 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tracts \nor the histone stem-loop structure at the 3' end, \nrespectively. In agreement with this, Gemin5 \nstimulates translation of mRNAs encoding \nribosomal proteins and histones. Dysregulation \nof RBPs produce widespread effects, challenging \nthe identification of the mechanism contributing \nto disease. Biallelic variants in Gemin5 gene found \nin patients with neurodevelopmental disorders \naffect key domains of the protein, the dimerization \nmodule (TPR) and the noncanonical RNA-binding \nsite (RBS1) (Figure 1). Whereas the RBS1 variant \nconfers protein instability, the TPR variants \ndisrupt protein dimerization and fail to associate with ribosomes, hampering its role in translation \ncontrol. All mutants are defective in the interaction \nwith protein networks involved in translation and \nRNA-driven pathways. Thus, in-depth studies \nof Gemin5 variants provided a molecular basis \nof disease associated with malfunction of this \nprotein, opening new avenues of research for this \nmultifunctional protein.

The differential reading \nof this info is key to generate the diversity of cell \ntypes during the developmental program of a \ncomplex organism. In this frame, the transcription \nof DNA into RNA constitutes the first stage of that \nreading and is essential to establish differential \ngene expression patterns defining the distinct cell \nlineages. In addition to transcription, the process \nof mitosis is fundamental to obtain the precise \nnumber of cells to build a whole organism while the \nestablishment of most of the cell lineages required \nthe passage of cells through mitosis. Interestingly, \ntranscription is widely silenced during mitosis due \nthe release of RNA polymerases and transcription \nfactors from the condensing chromatin. Once \nmitosis ends, transcription restart immediately to \nguarantee the viability and identity of daughter \ncells. The mechanisms behind transcription \nrestart following mitosis are poorly understood. \nHow daughter cells remember the transcriptional \nprogram of the mother or/and how those programs \nrewire during development are mostly unknown. In \nour laboratory we aim to answer these questions \nusing the culture of mammalian cells as a model. One of our goals is to understand the dynamic and \nrecycling of the RNA polymerase 2, the enzyme \ntranscribing all protein coding genes in eukaryotes, \nand the associated complex named Cohesin. In \nparallel, we investigate the potential implication of \nthese processes in the etiology of developmental \ndiseases as cohesinopathies. By combining the use \nof cell culture, genomic and proteomic approaches, \nCRISPR technology and live cell microscopy, we aim \nto understand how the transcriptional machinery \nworks across the challenge of mitosis with the hope \nto understand how gene expression and cell division \ncoordinates during development.https://www.cbm.uam.es/cperea37\nGenome Decoding Unit\n CBM 2021-2022List of publications\nThese articles were published before incorporation to \nCBMSO.\n \u00bbArdehali MB, Damle M, Perea-Resa C, Blower MD, Kingston \nRE.

Therefore, the major \naim of our work is to decipher new molecular biomarkers \nand to propose more effective and less toxic treatments. \nTo this end, we integrate data from genomics, \ntranscriptomics and proteomics approaches as a start \npoint to identify new driver-molecular mechanisms. \nDuring the 2021-2022 period we have continued with \nthe identification of new mutations and changes in \ngene expression that have allowed us to propose new \ntherapy strategies. In this sense, we have evidenced that \nthe efficacy of \u03b3-secretase inhibitors depends on the \ngene dosage of the MYC gene. We have also performed \na proteomic analysis that reveals new non-apoptotic \nfunctions of FADD protein in these neoplasms. In order to \nimprove our understanding on the efficacy of radiation, \nwe have demonstrated the advantages of combined \nradiation regimens in controlling tumorigenesis that \nallow better control of healthy tissue homeostasis \nand facilitate tumour cell death. In addition, we are \ncurrently interested in evaluating the dysregulation of \ncircular RNAs and long and short ncRNAs, to achieve a \ncomprehensive view of the complex regulatory lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes dysregulated in T-cell \nlymphoblastic neoplasms in the context of a personalized \nprecision medicine. To this end, we have investigated the \ndifferential expression patterns of circRNAs in different \ndevelopment stages of human thymocytes to perform \npredictions in silico regarding the ability of specific \ncircRNAs when controlling the expression of genes \ninvolved in thymocyte differentiation. Our study provides, \nfor the first time, significant insights into the usefulness \nof circRNAs in discriminating between different stages \nof thymocyte differentiation and provides new potential \ncircRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks capable of controlling \nthe expression of genes involved in T-cell differentiation \nin the thymus. Regarding the analysis of lncRNAs, we \nhave reported a new easy-to-use method, by coupling the \nspecificity of a peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-labelled probe \nwith flow cytometry (RNA-Flow FISH method that allows \na reliable quantification of long lncRNAs, in particular \nthose related to telomeres (TERRA and TERC) in cell lines \nand blood, with broad applications in basic research and \nclinical diagnostics.Group Members\nPrincipal Investigator: \nJos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez Piqueras\n(retired 25/8/22) \nCoPI:\nJavier Santos Hern\u00e1ndez\nScientific Staff: \nMar\u00eda del Consuelo Villa \nMorales\nMar\u00eda del Pilar L\u00f3pez Nieva\nConcepci\u00f3n Vaquero \nLorenzo\nAlfonso Bl\u00e1zquez Castro \nPostdoctoral fellows: \nIria Gonz\u00e1lez Vasconcellos  \n(until september 2022) \nPredoctoral fellows: \nAntonio Lahera Alonso \n(until december 2022)  \nLaura Vela Mart\u00edn\nSara Ruiz Garc\u00eda.Technicians:  \nM\u00aa \u00c1ngeles Cobos \nFern\u00e1ndez  \n(until june 2022)\nIsabel Merl\u00edn Sastre\n \nUndergraduate  \nstudents\nTFGs: \nNatalia Ansede \nBordonaba  \n(2021/2022)\nLaura P\u00e9rez G\u00f3mez \n(2021/2022)\nDaniel Parra S\u00e1nchez \n(2021/2022)\nTFM: \nDami\u00e1n Stodulski Cielsa \n(2021/2022)           GENETICS AND CELL BIOLOGY OF CANCER:  \nT-CELL LYMPHOBLASTIC NEOPLASMS\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/jfpiqueras39\nGenome Decoding Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nA.

No acceptable vaccine \nfor preventing leishmaniasis exists and treatment \noptions are limited. Moreover, Leishmania is an \natypical eukaryote regarding genome organization \nand gene expression regulation: genes are expressed \nas long transcription units requiring extensive post-\ntranscriptional processing. Thus, Leishmania is an \nadequate model for studying post-transcriptional \nregulation without the interference of transcriptional \nregulation. The main research activity of our group \nis focused on genome organization and gene \nexpression studies. Still, we maintain some activity \nin developing vaccines to prevent leishmaniasis and \nimproving diagnosis/typing methods. \nIn the last coup of years, our group has continued \nimproving the genomic assemblies of prototypical \nLeishmania species, by a combination of second \nand third-generation NGS methodologies. In this \nregard, the collaboration with the Genomics & \nMassive Sequencing service at CBMSO (headed by \nDr Bego\u00f1a Aguado) is paramount. In particular, \nwe have generated a de novo assembly for \nLeishmania major (Friedlin) genome, which was \nthe first Leishmania genome sequenced (in 2005) \nand from then it became a reference and source \nfor many molecular studies. In consequence, the \nnew assembly generated by our group has gained \ngeneral acceptance (TriTrypDB). Also, our group has determined the poly-A+ transcriptome for this \nspecies and generated complete gene models, paving \nthe way for addressing differential gene expression. \nGenomic annotations require a continuous process \nof curation, derived from new studies that uncover \nfunctional roles of genes/proteins previously \nunknown or by the characterization of new \ntranscripts/peptides that obligate to reconsider \nsome gene models. Thus, the alliance of proteomics, \ngenomics, and transcriptomics has resulted in a \npowerful combination for improving the annotation \nof the Leishmania genomes. For hosting the \ngenomics/transcriptomics data generated (and \ncurated) by our group for four Leishmania species (L. \nmajor, L. infantum, L. donovani y L. braziliensis) , a web \npage was created: http://leish-esp.cbm.uam.es .\nFinally, as members of the Tropical Diseases network \n(ISCIII; http://www.ricet.es/es/), which moved to a \nCIBER in infectious diseases (CIBERinfec; https://\nwww.ciberinfec.es) in 2022, our group was engaged \nin collaborative research dealing with the molecular \ndiagnosis and typing of Leishmania strains isolated \nfrom patients. In particular, we have characterized \nthe Leishmania mitochondrial genome (aka, \nkinetoplast DNA or kDNA) which usually is ignored \nin genomic studies due to its structural complexity. \nAfter a characterization of the kDNA for several \nLeishmania species (and other trypanosomatids), \nwe demonstrated that the kDNA maxicircle is a \nsuperior molecular marker for taxonomic and \ntyping purposes in trypanosomatids.Group Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nJose Mar\u00eda Requena \nRolan\u00eda\nScientific Staff\nManuel Soto \u00c1lvarez\nPostdoctoral fellows\nAlba Sebasti\u00e1n Mart\u00edn  \n(2021)\nJose Carlos Solana\nPredoctoral fellows\nEsther Camacho Cano \nAlejandro S\u00e1nchez \nSalvador (sep-2022)Technicians\nJavier Ad\u00e1n Jim\u00e9nez \n(2022)\nUndergraduate and \nMaster Students \nAndrea Clemente Ure\u00f1a  \n(2021)\nCarmen Palomino Cano  \n(2021)\nMauricio Reinoso Due\u00f1as \n(2021)\nStefania Merino (2022)REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION IN LEISHMANIA\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/jmrequena41\nGenome Decoding Unit\n CBM 2021-2022List of publications\n \u00bbNocua, P.A., Requena, J.M., and Puerta, C.J.

In the last two years, we further \ncharacterized the role of ES6S region of 40S ribosomal \nsubunit in mRNA entry and ribosome scanning in \ndifferent eukaryotic species (mammals, plants, \ninsects and yeast). Our data suggest the ES6S region \ncould be serving as a platform for the recruitment \nof RNA helicases (eIF4A and DDX3, among others) \ninvolved in RNA secondary structure unwinding. By \nusing the nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 as a tool, we \nare also studying how the base composition of 5' \nUTR and CDS regions shape translation and mRNA \nstability in human cells.  We continue to study how cells reprogramme \ntranslation during the stress response in yeast and \nmammals by modulating the activity of eIF2 and \neIF2A factors, and the physiological impact of this \nresponse on cell and organismal adaptation, survival \nand aging. Thus, we recently found that preventing \neIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation not only impaired stress \nresponse, but also accelerated aging in yeast by a \nmechanism that involves proteostasis disruption. \nIn this context, our research will focus on the study \nof key processes regulating proteostasis such as \nprotein aggregation and autophagy and how they \naffect cell longevity.\nREGULATION OF m RNA TRANSLATION IN EUKARYOTES  \nAND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR ORGANISMAL LIFE\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/iventosoGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nIv\u00e1n Ventoso\nJuan Jos\u00e9 Berlanga\nMiguel \u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez \nMargarita Cabrera   \n(since May 2022)  \nPostdoctoral fellows: \nTania Matamoros Technicians:\nJos\u00e9 Alcalde\nCristina Blanco \nUndergraduate  and \nMaster Students: \nDar\u00edo Aguilar\nAlazne Rubio43\nGenome Decoding Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nInvolvement of ribosomal ES6S region and eIF2 in mRNA threading and initiation codon recognition, respectively.

DNA replication itself is an important source \nof DNA damage, e.g., when a replication fork stalls is at risk of breaking. Luckily, \nspecialized checkpoints and mechanisms of DNA repair, translesion  synthesis,  re-\npriming,  histone  reloading and  telomere  maintenance  prevent  accumulation of \nDNA damage, prolonging cell and organismal fitness while avoiding pathological \nprocesses such as cancer.\nLuis  Blanco  group  further delineated the mechanism  of DNA  primer  synthesis  \nby  human  PrimPol,  a  specific  primase  alleviating  DNA replication stress, \ncharacterizing a motif crucial to stabilize the incoming 3\u00b4deoxynucleotide during \nreplication fork restart, its discrimination against dideoxynucleotides, and the \nmechanism of PolDIP2-dependent stimulation of dNTP binding and processivity of \nhuman PrimPol.\nMiguel de Vega group characterized a novel DNA polymerase (IEE) mainly present \nwithin enterohemorrhagic, enteropathogenic and enterotoxigenic E. coli strains.

Importantly, IEE is competent \nfor DNA end-joining suggesting its potential to repair double-strand breaks.\nJos\u00e9 A. Tercero group has shown a differential recruitment of the central DNA \ndamage tolerance protein Rad5/HLTF into two types of nuclear foci in response \nto cellular stress. This relocalization is mediated by the conserved E2-ubiquitin \nconjugating enzyme Rad6 through different pathways, uncovering a link between \nthe maintenance of genome stability and proteostasis that, in turn, helps to better \nunderstand cellular homeostasis as a whole.Genome Dynamics \nand Function \nGenome Maintenance  \nand Instability Unit \n45\nLuis Blanco D\u00e1vila\nGENOME MAINTENANCE AND VARIABILITY: \nENZYMOLOGY OF DNA REPLICATION AND REPAIR\nAura Carreira Moreno \nGENOME INSTABILITY AND CANCER \nPREDISPOSITION \nMiguel de Vega\nMAINTENANCE OF BACTERIAL GENOME \nSTABILITY\nIgnacio Flores \nTELOMERES IN CANCER AND REGENERATIONMar\u00eda G\u00f3mez\nFUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE \nMAMMALIAN GENOME\nEmilio Lecona\nCHROMATIN, CANCER AND THE UBIQUITIN \nSYSTEM\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Tercero Ordu\u00f1a\nCHROMOSOME REPLICATION AND GENOME \nSTABILITY\nGenome Maintenance and Instability Unit CBM 2021-2022\nApplying a combination of sophisticated genomic approaches and single molecule \nanalyses, Mar\u00eda G\u00f3mez group unveiled unexpected regulatory roles of histone H1 on \nnon-coding RNA turnover and m6A deposition, highlighting the intimate relationship \nbetween chromatin conformation, RNA metabolism, and DNA replication to maintain \ngenome performance.\nThe group of Emilio Lecona has shown that the AAA ATPase VCP/p97 limits the basal \nactivation of the replication stress response through the extraction of the DNA \npolymeras alpha/Primase complex from chromatin and they have proposed that \nubiquitin and SUMO work as timers to control DNA replication.\nAura Carreira group has uncovered the RNA helicase DDX5, as an interacting partner \nof the tumor suppressor and DNA repair mediator BRCA2. Both proteins cooperate \nin the resolution of DNA-RNA hybrids at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) of highly \ntranscribed regions. This activity in turn enhances high-fidelity repair of DSBs by \nhomologous recombination in human cells. This function is impaired in certain BRCA2-\nassociated breast cancer variants.\nIgnacio Flores group has discovered unique patterns of telomere fusions related to the \nalternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) in various types of cancer. A notable finding \nwas the identification of telomere fusions in the blood of cancer patients, which could \nbe used as a highly specific and sensitive method for early cancer detection.\nAs  described  in  more detail  in  this  report,  de Vega and Blanco labs have continued \ntheir collaborative projects to develop a novel diagnostic method of SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection, based on the isothermal amplification of specific padlock probes. This novel \nmethod is being protected by a CSIC patent.46\nGenome Dynamics and Function Program CBM 2021-2022\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/lblanco\nSummary\nReplicative DNA polymerases are primarily \nresponsible for the copying of template DNA. Overall \nDNA replication is assisted by other enzymes and \nfactors that prevent the collapse of the replication \nfork when encountering unrepaired lesions and \nblocking structures on the template DNA, or upon \ninsertion of unnatural nucleotides that can act as \nchain terminators. All these problems are defined as \n\"replication stress\" (RS), which can lead to genome \ninstability.\nMore than a decade ago we described the relevance \nof a new enzyme, PrimPol, in the DNA replication \nprocess, and more specifically in tolerance to \nRS. In response to replication fork blockage, the \nunique DNA primase activity of PrimPol creates \na new replicative starting point beyond the lesion \nor blockage point, which allows DNA replicase to \ncontinue replication, thus relieving RS, but leaving a \ngap behind that needs to be filled later.\nPrevious findings in collaboration with Juan M\u00e9ndez \nlab (CNIO; Madrid), showed a significant reduction of \nreplication fork speed during nuclear DNA replication \nin the absence of PrimPol, that promoted firing of \nnew replication origins. We have recently shown in \ncollaboration with Karen Anderson (Yale Univ. USA) \nthat this PrimPol-mediated repriming mechanism has \nalso relevance for mitochondrial DNA maintenance, \nespecially under therapeutic conditions with antiretroviral nucleotide analogues. This is because \nPrimPol is able to discriminate various nucleotide \nanalogues as tenofovir or ddC (Carvalho et al., 2021), \nbut the absence of repriming due to a dysfunctional \nPrimPol hinders successful mitochondrial DNA \nreplication, ultimately leading to mitochondrial \ntoxicity. Therefore, PrimPol re-priming becomes a \nkey element for DNA replication specially under RS \nconditions at both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA \nreplication. \nAs part of our detailed structure-function studies of \nPrimPol,  we have identified a key amino acid motif, \nWFYY, crucial to bind the incoming 3\u00b4dNTP at the \ndimer formation step of primer synthesis (Calvo \net al., 2021). In collaboration with Sjoerd Wanrooij \nlab (Univ Umea, Sweden), we have recently shown \nthat the accessory replication protein PolDIP2 is a \nPrimPol interactor which stimulates PrimPol activity \nby increasing its affinity for the dNTP substrates \n(Kasho et al., 2021). \nFrom a biotechnological perspective,  we are exploring  \nnovel primases to optimize our co-developed \nPrimPol-based DNA amplification method named \nTruePrime\u2122, which is currently commercialized by \n4BaseBio AG for the diagnosis of cancer in liquid \nbiopsies, and for the massive preparation of synthetic \nDNA to fulfill the growing demand in gene therapy \nand preparation of DNA vaccines.Group Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nLuis Blanco D\u00e1vila\nPostdoctoral fellow:\nMar\u00eda Isabel Mart\u00ednez \nJim\u00e9nez \nPredoctoral fellows:\nNieves Calero Mu\u00f1oz\nCristina Vel\u00e1zquez Ruiz\nAna Mart\u00ednez Carr\u00f3n\nMarcos Jim\u00e9nez JulianaTechnician:\nSusana Guerra Gonz\u00e1lez\nVisiting scientist:\nPaola Libertad Garc\u00eda \nMedel  \n(February-October, 2022)GENOME MAINTENANCE AND VARIABILITY:  \nENZYMOLOGY OF DNA REPLICATION AND REPAIR 47\nCBM 2021-2022 Genome Maintenance and Instability UnitList of publications\n \u00bbCarvalho, G., D\u00edaz-Talavera, A., Calvo, P.A., Blan -\nco, L. and Mart\u00ednez-Jim\u00e9nez, M.I.

This serves us to investigate the \nconsequences of BRCA2 mutation in breast cancer \npredisposition. \nThrough a BRCA2-N-terminus \u2018interactome\u2019 \nperformed in our lab, we have identified and \ncharacterized novel interacting partners of BRCA2 \ninvolved in other DNA repair pathways. This \nscreening revealed RNA helicases and splicing \nfactors among the most enriched. Interestingly, \nBRCA2 deficient cells accumulate R-loops providing evidence for its role in either R-loop prevention \nor processing. During this period, we have shown \nthat BRCA2 and the RNA helicase DDX5 cooperate \nto resolve DNA-RNA hybrids DNA double-strand \nbreaks located in transcribed regions (Sessa \net al EMBOJ 2021).

IS629 \nis present in most strains of enterohemorrhagic \nEscherichia coli O157 and provokes polymorphisms \nassociated with gene inactivation and/or genomic \ndeletions. Previous results showed that excision of \nIS629 is promoted by the IS-excision enhancer (IEE) \nprotein in a transposase dependent manner. We \nhave shown that IEE is present in more than 30% \nof all available E. coli  genome assemblies, mainly \nwithin enterohemorrhagic, enteropathogenic and \nenterotoxigenic genomes. We showed that IEE is \nendowed with an error-prone DNA polymerase \nactivity in its N-terminal archaeo-eukaryotic primase \n(AEP) domain able to promote dislocations of the \nprimer and template strands. Importantly, IEE has \nthe ability to carry out an end-joining reaction of \n3\u2019-single-strand DNA overhangs. It should be note \nthat most bacterial species lack an end-joining \nmechanism to repair and safeguard the genome \nfollowing the generation of double stranded DNA \nbreaks (DSBs) by the transposase during the excision \nof the IS. Our results lead us to propose that once \nthe DSBs are created by the transposase, IEE would \nbe instrumental to search for microhomologies \nbetween both ends allowing their repair. During these years we collaborated with Thomas \nHelleday lab (Karolinska Institute) in the analysis \nof human OGG1 (hOGG1) activity in the presence \nof small activators. hOGG1 is a bifunctional \nglycosilase that removes 8-oxoguanine from the \nDNA generating an abasic site (AP) and has a very \nweak AP lyase that cleaves the AP site releasing a 3\u2019-\nPUA end. Both, the AP sites and the 3\u2019-PUA ends are \nsubsequently removed by human AP endonuclease \n1. Previous analysis from the Helleday\u2019s group \nshowed that a small compound TH10785 activated \nthe AP lyase activity of hOGG1. Our in vitro analyses \nallowed us to conclude that the small activator was \nconferring a new activity to hOGG1 that enabled the \nenzyme to break AP sites releasing a product with a \nterminal 3\u2019 phosphate that should be eliminated by \na phosphatase to complete the repair process. This \nresult was confirmed in vivo by the Helleday\u2019s group \nthat showed that TH10785 created a dependency \nof PNPK1 (the main phosphatase involved in base \nexcision repair) to repair the oxidative damage in \ncells. This work opened the possibility to reroute or \ncontrol DNA repair pathways.www.cbm.uam.es/de-vega-labGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nMiguel de Vega\nPostdoctoral fellow:\nPatricia A.

An important aspect of telomere \nbiology is the potential for telomere fusions, which \noccur when two chromosomes become physically \njoined at their telomeres. This can trigger a series \nof genomic rearrangements and oncogenic \nalterations, ultimately leading to the development of \nmalignant tumors and resistance to chemotherapy. \nDespite their relevance in tumor evolution, our \nunderstanding of the patterns and consequences of \ntelomere fusions in human cancer is still limited. Our \ngroup is currently focused on understanding the \nrole of telomeric fusions in cancer and regeneration.\nTelomere fusions in cancer: In recent years, we \nhave used whole-genome sequencing data to \nstudy the rates and spectrum of somatic telomere \nfusions (TFs) in over 30 different types of cancer. \nOur findings indicate that TFs are widespread \nin human tumors, with rates that vary greatly \nbetween and within different types of cancer. In \naddition to end-to-end fusions, we have identified \nunique patterns of TFs that are linked to the activity \nof the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) \npathway. We have also detected TFs in the blood \nof cancer patients, offering a potential method for early cancer detection with high specificity and \nsensitivity. Understanding the role of TFs in cancer \nwill be crucial in developing targeted therapies and \nimproving patient outcomes.\nTelomere fusions in cardiomyocyte maturation and \nheart regeneration: Maturation in many mammalian \ncells, including cardiomyocytes, is accompanied \nby an increase in the number of chromosomes, \nor polyploidization. This increase in chromosome \nsets may contribute to the limited ability of \nmature cardiomyocytes to divide after a damage, \nas polyploid cells are often unable to undergo \nsuccessful cell division. While the importance of \ncardiomyocyte polyploidy is well-recognized, the \nmechanism behind it is not understood. In recent \nyears using a high-content imaging approach, we \nhave discovered that approximately half of postnatal \nmouse cardiomyocytes that enter mitosis have \ndiscernible chromosome bridges. Furthermore, \nwe observed that the ploidy of cardiomyocytes \nis tracked by an increasing number of fusions \nbetween chromosome ends, providing evidence \nof a direct link between TFs and cardiomyocyte \npolyploidization. Our study suggests that telomere \nfusions play a role in causing chromosome bridging \nand polyploidization, and controlling their presence \nmay be crucial in enhancing heart regeneration.TELOMERES IN CANCER AND REGENERATION\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/iflores53\nCBM 2021-2022 Genome Maintenance and Instability Unit\nList of publications\n \u00bbFrancesc Muyas, Manuel Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez Rodriguez, Isidro \nCortes-Ciriano, Ignacio Flores.The ALT pathway generates \ntelomere fusions that can be detected in the blood of \ncancer patients. bioRxiv 2022.01.25.477771; doi: https://\ndoi.org/10.1101/2022.01.25.477771\n \u00bbMarielle Breau, Christelle Cayrou, Dmitri Churikov, Charles \nFouillade, Sandra Curras-Alonso, Serge Bauwens, Frederic \nJourquin, Laura Braud, Frederic Fiore, R\u00e9my Castellao, \nEmmanuelle Josselin, Carlota S\u00e1nchezFerrer, Giovanna \nGiovinazzo, Eric Gilson, Ignacio Flores, Arturo Londono-\nVallejo, Serge Adnot, Vincent G\u00e9li.

The general \naim of our laboratory is understanding how the \nprocesses of DNA replication and transcription \nare coordinated in mammalian cells to maintain \ngenome stability. This knowledge is fundamental for \nbasic biology and have enormous implications for \ncell fate specification in physiology and pathology. \nTo investigate this we combine the application \nof genomics, epigenomics, epitranscriptomics, \nmolecular biology and imaging techniques to a \nvariety of cell scenarios with altered chromatin \nstructure and/or transcription dysregulation.\nIn our recent work we showed that appropriate \nRNA turnover in chromatin is essential to avoid \nreplicative stress and limit replication-transcription \nconflicts, and unveiled an unexpected role of histone \nH1 on RNA post-transcriptional modifications. In \nparticular, we found that non-coding RNA retention \nin chromatin associates with reduced levels of m6A \nin histone H1-depleted cells, resulting in increased stability of chromatin-bound RNAs and R-loops \naccumulation, which in turn generates problems \nwith incoming DNA replication forks. Accordingly, \naltering the m6A RNA methylation pathway \nrescues the replicative phenotype of H1 loss. Our \nfindings uncover a novel link between chromatin \nconformation and non-coding RNA turnover and \nm6A deposition, with important implications for \nunderstanding genome functionality. In addition, \nin this period we have investigated the usage of \nreplication origins upon stress challenges. We found \nthat is the frequency of activation of the same pool \nof replication origins what is mainly increased upon \nstress, and that, in unchallenged cells, the frequency \nof activation correlated with the 3D organization of \nthe origins in the nucleus. These results support \nthe proposed architectural organization of origins \nin DNA replication factories and highlight the tight \nsimilarities between replication and transcription \nmultimolecular assemblies in the 3D nucleus.FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE MAMMALIAN GENOME55\nCBM 2021-2022 Genome Maintenance and Instability UnitParticipation in projects\n \u00bbDNA replication as a driver for cell fate decisions \n(RepliFate) (GA101072903) European Research Executive \nAgency.

Our group is interested in understanding \nhow the small protein modifiers ubiquitin and \nSUMO control DNA replication. In the last two years \nwe have provided new insights into the role of the \nSUMO/ubiquitin equilibrium in chromatin during \nDNA replication and cell cycle progression. Building \nup on our observation that the deubiquitylase USP7 \nmaintains the SUMO rich environment at active \nreplication forks (Lecona et al. , NSMB 2016; Lecona and \nFern\u00e1ndez Capetillo, Bioessays 2016), we now show \nthat USP7 links S phase progression and the activation \nof the mitotic program through the regulation of CDK1 \n(Galarreta et al. , EMBO J 2021). USP7 inhibition leads to \na premature activation of the mitotic program that \ncontributes to cell death induced by USP7 inhibitors \nand is relevant for their application in cancer treatment \n(Galarreta et al. , IJMS 2021). \nThe SUMOylation and ubiquitylation of replication \nfactors modulates their functions or targets them \nfor extraction by the AAA ATPase VCP/p97 (Mart\u00edn-\nRufo et al. , Sem Cell Dev Biol 2022).  Our work has \nshown that VCP/p97 associates with its adaptor FAF1 \nin S phase to extract SUMOylated and ubiquitylated \nfactors from chromatin. Thus, VCP/p97 cooperates with the deubiquitylase USP7 to coordinately control \nthe SUMO/ubiquitin landscape during DNA replication \n(Franz et al. , Cell Rep 2021). Further, we have observed \nthat VCP/p97 limits the basal activation of the \nreplication stress response (RSR) in an unperturbed \nS phase. In this context, VCP/p97 removes the DNA \npolymerase \u03b1/Primase complex from chromatin and \nprevents the accumulation of primed DNA structures \nthat activate the RSR (Rodr\u00edguez-Acebes, Mart\u00edn-Rufo \net al. , bioRxiv 2022). \nFinally, we have explored the functions of the group \nSUMOylation of the replisome and its interplay with \nthe ubiquitylation of replication factors. Our results \nshow that ubiquitin and SUMO play independent \nfunctions during DNA replication. While depleting \nprotein SUMOylation alters DNA replication \ndynamics without inducing replication stress and \nDNA damage, the inhibition of the ubiquitin pathway \nactivates the RSR without altering the speed of DNA \nreplication forks. \nIn the last two years, our advances have established \nthe relevance of the ubiquitin/SUMO landscape in \nchromatin during DNA replication. Now we want to \nexplore how the ubiquitin/SUMO pathways shape \nreplisome composition to control DNA replication, \ncell identity and cancer.Group Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nEmilio Lecona\nPredoctoral fellow:\nRodrigo Mart\u00edn Rufo\nMaster and undergraduate \nstudents:\nTom\u00e1s Viuda  \n(from October 2022)\n\u00c1ngel Mora   \n(October 2021-July 2022)\nGuillermo de la Vega \nBarranco  \n(October 2020-July 2021)Clara Plaza  \n(from October 2022)\nAlejandra Perona  \n(from October 2022)\nYolanda Andr\u00e9s  \n(October 2021-June 2022)\nAlejandro Fern\u00e1ndez \nLlorente  \n(September 2020-June 2021)\nT\u00e9cnicos de laboratorio:\nDaniel Hern\u00e1ndez   \n(from September 2022)CHROMATIN, CANCER AND THE UBIQUITIN SYSTEM\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/elecona57\nCBM 2021-2022\nPie imagenGenome Maintenance and Instability UnitOther activities\n \u00bbSymposium \u201cDNA replication at the heart of cell fate \ndecisions and cancer development\u201d CBMSO (21/11/2022).\n \u00bbSevero Ochoa Meetings Committee, Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola \nde Bioqu\u00edmica y Biolog\u00eda Molecular (SEBBM).\nThe SUMO-rich environment in the replisome is maintained by the action of USP7 and VCP/p97, in association with \nFAF1.

Our main goal is to better \nunderstand how genome stability is maintained \nduring chromosome replication, especially in the \npresence of DNA damage or replicative stress. \nThe molecular bases of these processes are \nevolutionarily conserved, allowing us to study \nthem in detail using the genetically tractable yeast \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae  as a eukaryotic model \norganism.\nDuring this period we have focused our studies \non the analysis of the regulation and function of \nproteins involved in the mechanisms of DNA damage \ntolerance (DDT). These mechanisms overcome \nunrepaired DNA lesions that block replication \nforks, thereby contributing to the completion of \nchromosome replication in every cell cycle, and \nare therefore important for the maintenance of \ngenome integrity. A central DDT protein is the E3 \nubiquitin ligase and ATPase/helicase Rad5 (HTLF/\nSHPRH in human cells), which mediates template-\nswitch recombination, an error-free mode of bypassing DNA lesions, and also influences the \nrecruitment and activity of translesion DNA \nsynthesis polymerases. We have found that Rad5 is \nregulated in different ways, including relocalization, \npost-translational modifications and oscillation \nof protein levels throughout the cell cycle. We \nhave shown that Rad5 is regulated in response to \ncellular stress by intranuclear relocalization via \ndifferential recruitment into two types of foci, both \noftentimes coexisting within the same cell. We \nhave found that one type of foci represents sites \nof protein activity while the other marks places of \nsequestration of damaged or misfolded protein \ndestined for subsequent refolding. We have \ndeciphered the common and distinct pathways \nand mechanisms involved in the formation of each \ntype of foci and have uncovered a link between the \nmaintenance of genome stability and proteostasis, \nwhich in turn helps to understand cellular \nhomeostasis as a whole. We have also shown that \nRad5 reaches maximum protein levels during the \nS phase of the cell cycle. These levels are directly \nrelated to the timing of this protein\u2019s activity and \nare strictly regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome \npathway. Moreover, we have found that Rad5 is a \nphosphoprotein, which may have implications for \nits activity and mode of action.

The \ntetraspanin CD9 associates specifically with different \ncell adhesion receptors of the immunoglobulin \nand integrin families in tetraspanin-enriched \nmicrodomains (TEMs). Through these interactions, \nCD9 exerts important regulatory effects on \nthe function of associated adhesion molecules. \nExosomes are a type of extracellular vesicles (EVs) of \nendocytic origin which serve important intercellular \ncommunication functions. Exosomes are produced \nand released by a large variety of donor cells in \nall multicellular organisms and contain a specific \ncargo of lipids, proteins, miRNAs, mRNAs and DNA, \nwhich upon their selective binding and/or uptake \ncan modify the phenotype and trigger a functional \nresponse in target cells. Tetraspanins are very \nabundantly expressed on the surface of different \ntypes of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including \nexosomes, and these proteins are amongst the best \nmarkers for these EVs.Exosomes produced by cancer cells have been \nshown to influence many processes related to \ncancer progression and metastasis but the specific \nmolecules that mediate their interaction and uptake \nby distinct target cells have remained elusive. We \nhave isolated exosomes produced by colorectal \ncarcinoma (CRC) and ovarian cancer (OvC) cells and \nperformed cell-adhesion assays on immobilized \nexosomes and also measured the uptake of \nfluorescently-labelled exosomes by using flow \ncytometry and confocal microscopy techniques. We \nfound that the interaction between cellular integrin \n\u03b15\u03b21 and its ligand ADAM17 on the exosomal surface \nmediated the binding and uptake of cancer-derived \nexosomes. Interestingly, this process was negatively \nregulated by the expression of tetraspanin CD9 on \nexosomes. The adhesion molecule ALCAM/CD166 is \nalso involved in the interaction of cancer-derived EVs \nwith recipient cancer cells and in their subsequent \nuptake. The identification of ALCAM/CD166 as a \nmolecule mediating the docking and uptake of CRC \nand OvC-derived EVs could be potentially exploited \nto block the peritoneal metastasis cascade promoted \nby EVs in CRC and OvC patients.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nCarlos Caba\u00f1as Guti\u00e9rrez\nPredoctoral fellows:\nBeatriz Carde\u00f1es P\u00e9rez (until January, 2022)\nIrene Clares Pedrero\nTamara Bezos Carmona  (since April, 2021)\nAlmudena Rocha Mulero (since September, 2021)\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/ccabanas65\nCell-Cell Communication & Inflammation Unit\n CBM 2021-2022Schematic representation of the involvement of ADAM17, CD9 and integrin \u03b15\u03b21 in the interactions between exosomes and recipient cells. \nThe interaction of exosomes with cells is mediated by integrin \u03b15\u03b21 (in cells) and ADAM17 (in exosomes) and is further regulated by CD9. \nList of publications\n \u00bbCarde\u00f1es B, Clares I, Bezos T, Toribio V, L\u00f3pez-Mart\u00edn \nS, Rocha A, Peinado H, Y\u00e1\u00f1ez-M\u00f3 M, Caba\u00f1as C.

The group identified \nmediators of pathological vascular wall remodeling \nthat are involved in atherosclerosis, restenosis, \nintramural hematoma, arterial hypertension, \nthoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD), \nand abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Indeed, \nthe team has recently identified novel genes that \nmediate aortic diseases, including RCAN1, C/EBP\u03b2, \nADAMTS1  or NOS2 . They have shown that these \ngenes are essential to maintain aortic homeostasis \nand that their deficiency leads to aortic aneurism \nand dissections (Nat Med 2017; Nat Commun 2018) . \nTheir findings have allowed the identification of new \npathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic \ntargets in aortic diseases. Their studies showing \nthat deficiency of the metalloproteinase Adamts1 \nleads to aortic pathology in mice due to increased \nNos2-dependent NO production (Nat Med 2017)  were \nparticularly pioneering, changed the current view \nof the pathophysiology of TAAD, and opened new \nexciting avenues of research into the pathogenesis \nof TAADs that led to the identification of new targets \nfor pharmacological intervention and potential \nbiomarkers for the follow up of Marfan syndrome \n(Nat Commun 2021) .This group has also made important contributions to \nthe field of lymphomagenesis and leukemogenesis, \ndiscovering a tumor suppressor role for E2F4 \nin B-cell lymphoma as a critical transcriptional \nrepressor of the E2F1  oncogene ( Leukemia 2012) ; \nidentifying MAZ as a critical activator of MYB  \nexpression and uncovering a novel mechanism for \novercoming transcriptional repression by the E2F-\npRB pathway (Nucleic Acids Res 2017) . By using gene \nexpression profiling they identified CDCA7 as a gene \noverexpressed in lymphoid tumors and discovered \nthat its high expression is required for lymphoma/\nleukemia growth in soft gels, but not in liquid media; \nfor tumor formation in immunodeficient mice; and \nfor lymphoma migration and invasion through \nits capacity to modulate tubulin and actomyosin \ncytoskeleton dynamics (Haematologica 2018 & 2020) . \nThe selective role of CDCA7 in soft gels is of special \ninterest because tumor initiating cells (TICS), which \nare particularly resistant to current chemotherapy \nor radiotherapy, can be selected from a pool of \ntumor cells by culturing them in these gels. The \ngroup is currently funded by the Spanish Association \nAgainst Cancer  to identify additional genes critical \nfor lymphoid tumor growth in soft gels because \nthese genes are potentially critical for TICs growth \nin vivo and hence facilitate the design of therapies \nthat efficiently target tumor initiating cells.67\nCell-Cell Communication & Inflammation Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nImages showing nuclei (blue staning), increased pVASP-S239 \nstaining (red), and disorganized elastic fibers (green) in the \naortic wall of a patient with Marfan Syndrome as compared \nwith a control donor (Healthy Aorta) List of publications\n \u00bbA. de la Fuente-Alonso, M.

Several signaling molecules act over long \ndistances, forming a gradient distribution within a \nmorphogenetic field. Some of these signals (called \nmorphogens) are modified by lipids, which confer \nthem a high affinity for membranes, making their \nfree propagation through tissues difficult. Direct \ncontact between cell membranes by filopodia-\nlike structures (also known as cytonemes) could \nbe a simple explanation for their dispersal. In \nDrosophila , we have demonstrated that cytonemes \nare required for the establishment of Hedgehog \n(Hh) morphogen gradient and that vesicles are the \nHh carriers in cytoneme-mediated transport for its \nsecretion. The ability of the receptor cells to respond \nspecifically to different ligand concentrations is also \nmediated by cytonemes. Our hypothesis is that \nduring morphogenesis cells exchange signaling \nproteins at sites of direct contact between cytoneme \nmembranes in a way similar to neuronal synapses. \nThe research of the group is related to the mechanisms \nof cell signaling communication, analyzing the \nimplication of cytoskeleton and vesicular trafficking \nin the process of signal presentation and reception \nand the crosstalk between signaling pathways. The \nspecific objetives are: 1) To study the mechanisms of \ninteraction between cytonemes from Hh-receiving \nand Hh-sending cells for Hh reception based on the functional interaction of the components of Hh \nsignalling complex on cytonemes (Fig.1). To this aim \nwe are investigating the possibility that the process \nof Hh signalling resembles a synaptic contact. 2) To \nexplore the molecular mechanisms for the formation, \nguidance and dynamic regulation of cytonemes \ninvolved in Hh signaling during normal development. \n3) To decipher the role of the EGFR pathway in \ncytoneme formation and to analyze the crosstalk \nbetween pathways in normal and pathological \ndevelopment.\nOur research is interdisciplinary; we use diverse \nexperimental systems in a variety of Drosophila \ntissues, state-of-the-art methodologies for genetic, \ncellular and molecular analyses, superresolution and \n4D in vivo imaging confocal microscopy and electron \nmicroscopy. The quantitative information generated \nis allowing the development of mathematical models \nfor the signalling processes that, in turn, let us \nexplore different hypotheses. The knowledge of the \nmechanisms underlying cell-cell signaling and cell \nsignaling integration during normal development \nwill also contribute to understand other cell \ncommunication processes such as the maintenance \nof adult homeostasis and tumor progression. \nIn the same group, there is another line of investigation \nled by Dr. Ana Busturia with the title: \u201c Drosophila \nDevelopmental Epigenetics\u201d.

We use Drosophila as a \nmodel system to deepen our understanding of these \nprocesses in vertebrates. Three research areas are \nbeing developed. 1) We study organ communication \nmediated by hemolymph exosomes containing microRNAs that modify PcG/trxG levels in target \norgans. 2) We analyze the effect of the apoptosis \nmediated by the immune derived Antimicrobial \nPeptides on the modulation of PcG induced tumor \nformation. 3) We investigate the PcG- mediated \ntrans-generational inheritance of the physiological \ntraits observed upon supplementing Drosophila diet \nwith enriched milk fat globule membrane (MFGM).\nA)  Hedgehog (Hh) signaling conceived as a synapse-like process \nbetween Hh producing and receiving cells through cytoneme \ncontacts. For Hh presentation, after an intracellular recycling \nprocess in the Hh producing cells Hh travels in multivesicular \nbodies (MVBs) along cytonemes and is released to interact with \nthe reception complex at the contact sites. The Hh receptor \nPatched (Ptc) also has an intracellular recycling process in the \nreceiving cells and travels in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) along \ncytonemes to interact with Hh.\nB)  The adhesion protein and Hh co-receptors Ihog and the \nglypicans Dlp and Dally are recruited for ligand release and \nreceptor interaction. The soluble factor Shifted (Shf) (ortholog \nthe vertebrate Wif-1) helps the Hh release from the producing \ncell to the receiving cell cytonemes. The transmembrane proteins \nDispatched (Disp), required for Hh release from the producing \ncells, and Ptc in the receiving cytonemes also interact with some \nof the other proteins during the release and reception processes.

These multifunctional master \nregulators play prevalent roles in the expression/\nfunction of the human transcriptome, translatome, \nproteome and interactome in order to prevent the \ndevelopment of deleterious cellular phenotypes \nin compromised cellular situations. For example, \nchanges in the expression/function and/or \nsubcellular localization of TIA1 and/or TIAR have \nbeen associated with important physio(patho)\nlogical consequences on human biology, including \nembryogenesis, inflammation, tumorigenesis, \nneuronal homeostasis, tauopathies, myopathies, \ncell stress responses and viral infections. The \nparticipation of TIA proteins in these complex \nprograms points to their direct involvement in the \nregulation of myriad cellular pathways among other \napoptosis, autophagy/mitophagy, immune system, \nmembrane dynamics, axonal regeneration, activity \nand localization of cellular translational machinery, \ncell cycle, proteostasis, dynamics of stress granules \n(SGs) as well as oxidative and metabolism challenges \n(Figure 1, upper panel). Further, they are key \ncomponents of SGs, RNA and protein aggregates \nthat are formed in response to stressful stimuli to \nreduce cellular activity as a survival mechanism. For example, TIA1 p.E384K mutation is the genetic cause \nof Welander distal myopathy (WDM), a late-onset \nmuscular dystrophy whose pathogenesis has been \nrelated with altered SGs dynamics. Thus, we have \nexpanded our understanding of the main regulatory \nrole of T-cell intracellular antigens in physio(patho)\nlogical events as well as the connection between \nabnormal dynamics of TIA1-dependent stress \ngranules and WDM through a multidisciplinary \ngenetic, cellular and molecular approaches. Our \nobservations show distinct dynamics between the \nformation, assembly, and disassembly of TIA1WT/WDM-\ndependent SGs in molecular grammar-dependent \nway. These observations have allowed us to expand \nthe existing knowledge on the role of TIA1 and the \nWDM mutation in SGs dynamics (Figure 1, bottom \npanel).

Our group has \nshown that mesothelial cells undergo an epithelial-\nmesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to the \nperitoneal insult. During the last 20 years, we \nhave shown that mesothelial EMT (also termed \nMesothelial to Mesenchymal Transition, MMT) is a \ngood marker for membrane failure and a target for \npreventing PD-induced fibrosis and for the design \nof biocompatible PD fluids.  In this context, we \nhave studied the effect on MMT of a novel PD fluid, \npatented by our group (China patent: 107073022), \nin which the glucose has been substituted by \nStevioside as osmotic agent. We could demonstrate \nthat this PD fluid induces less MMT and causes \nless peritoneal damages, when compared with \nclassical glucose-based PD fluids (Kopitina et al., \n2022). Recently, we have patented a new PD fluid \n(Spanish Patent Reference:  ES1641.1754), in which \nthe osmotic agent is Troxerutin, a flavonoid with \npotent antioxidant activity, which has been shown \nto be cardioprotective in animal models. \nWe have also explored whether MMT plays a role in \nother pathologies such as peritoneal metastasis and \npost-surgical adhesions. Peritoneal metastasis is a \ncomplication of abdominal carcinomas (e.g. ovarian carcinoma) for which there is no effective therapy. \nProgression of the metastatic implants is affected by \nCarcinoma-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs). We have \nshown in human peritoneal implant biopsies that \na subpopulation of CAFs derives from mesothelial \ncells through MMT. Our results also suggest that \nthis MMT renders the peritoneum more receptive to \nimplantation of tumor cells, contributes to the growth \nand vascularization of secondary tumors and that MMT \nis a therapeutic target in peritoneal carcinomatosis.\nAdhesions are areas of fibrotic tissue that bind tissues \nand organs that would normally not be connected, \nand can be seriously life-threatening. Histological \nanalysis of human post-surgical adhesions has \ndemonstrated that mesothelial cells adjacent to the \nfibrotic tissue show signs of MMT, suggesting that \nthis could be an initial step in their development. \nOur results have shown that mechanical injury is \nthe main inducer of MMT during the formation of \nadhesions. Consequently, molecules involved in \nmechano-transduction, such as caveolin 1, play \na role in the regulation of mechanical MMT and \nadhesion formation. Recently, we have shown \nthat a extracellular matrix-based hydrogel, which \ncombines physical barrier and MMT-blocking \nfunctions, is an effective prophylactic biomaterial to \nmitigate the formation of peritoneal adhesions in an \nexperimental mouse model (Figure).Group Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nManuel L\u00f3pez Cabrera\nPostdoctoral fellows:\nPilar Sandoval Correa\nGuadalupe Gonz\u00e1lez \nMateo \nPredoctoral fellows:\nHenar Tomero Sanz \nLucia Pascual Ant\u00f3n \nValeria Kopytina \nEva Mar\u00eda Arriero Pa\u00eds\n Project Manager:\nJavier Carrero Liroa \nVisiting scientists:\nEsra Cetin  \n(Cardiff University, United \nKingdom):  \nJune 1st- July 8th 2022. \nVanessa Marchant \n(Fundaci\u00f3n J\u00edm\u00e9nez Diaz, \nUAM): February 1st-April 30th \n2021. 73\nCell-Cell Communication & Inflammation Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nECM-hydrogel treatment ameliorates peritoneal adhesion \nformation in mice.

During the inflammatory response, \ncellular barriers transiently alter the expression \nof surface adhesion receptors and increase their \npermeability to guide immune cells towards the \ninflammatory focus. The main goal of our research \ngroup is to investigate the molecular mechanisms \nunderlying the role of cellular barriers in the human \ninflammatory response. \nThe vascular endothelium controls the passage \nof cells and solutes between the blood and the \nparenchyma in the inflamed tissue. During these \ntwo years we have identified new molecular \nmechanisms whereby human endothelial cells \ncontrol their barrier properties, which has enabled \nus to reinforce the endothelial monolayer integrity \nin an inflammatory context. We are addressing the \nrole of the RhoA subfamily of GTPases in regulating \nVE-cadherin expression levels and endothelial \nbarrier function. We are exploring the role of this \nsubfamily as a therapeutic target to prevent organ \nedema during systemic inflammation. Finally, \nwe are applying our expertise to try to prevent \npulmonary endothelial barrier disruption caused \nby the cytokine storm induced by SARS-Cov-2 in \nseriously ill COVID19 patients.Once leukocytes traverse the endothelial barrier, \nthey establish adhesions with parenchymal cells, \nsearching for the inflammatory focus and for \ndysfunctional cells. The liver is a paradigm of \ncomplex organ in which leukocyte infiltration into the \ntissue is essential for immune-surveillance, control \nof cancer and infections, and tissue regeneration \n(Figure 1). ICAM-1 is the main adhesion receptor \nmediating leukocyte haptotaxis in hepatocytes. We \nfound that polarized hepatocytes confine ICAM-1 \nin their apical domains, which are not accessible to \nimmune cells, and that hepatic ICAM-1 polarization \nregulates hepatocyte-leukocyte interactions. \nWe are currently investigating the molecular \nmechanisms determining ICAM-1 polarity in hepatic \nbarriers and the role of ICAM-1 regulating bile \ncanalicular morphogenesis. To do so, we have set \nup experimental procedures to generate hepatic \norganoids in 3D, which have been obtained from \nbipotent precursors isolated from human and \nmurine livers.  \nFinally, these two years we have continued our \npartnership with the company Cornea SL to initiated \nan \u201cindustrial doctorate\u201d to carry out a project in \nwhich we search for new inflammatory prognostic \nmarkers in the corneal epithelial barrier of patients \nwith keratoconus, a disease of unknown etiology, \nwhich causes dramatic changes in the corneal shape \nthat eventually requires corneal transplant.

These results \nplace the metabolism of T cells at the crossroad \nbetween inflammation, senescence and aging, \nhighlighting that immunometabolism can be a \ntherapeutic target to delay aging. 2.

This \npro-apoptotic function includes the elimination by \ncell competition of oncogenic cells that may appear \nin development. Recent work has shown that JNK \nalso has a pro-proliferation function, mediated by \nparacrine signaling and associated with the activity \nof the JAK/STAT, Wingless (Wg) and Decapentaplegic \n(Dpp).\nRegarding the role of JNK function in tumorigenesis, \nwe have found that it is a major factor in the process. \nWe are presently investigating the role of JNK in the \ntumorigenic processes generated by mutations like \nscribble, erupted or polyhomeotic. Some to this work \nhas already been published (Medina et al 2021). We \nhave also found evidence for a new mechanism of \ninteractions between cell populations, such as that \novergrowing tumour cells are able to restrain the \ngrowth of neighbour normal tissues. This process \nmay provide new hints as to how tumour cells \ncolonise normal tissues.Another critical function of the JNK pathway is the \ninduction of senescence in Drosophila cells: Just a \ntransient stress given to cells refractory to apoptosis \nresults in their transformation into senescent cells \nthat contain indefinite JNK activity. Under these \nconditions those cells secrete proliferative signals \n(Upd, Dpp, Wg) that cause tumorigenic overgrowths \nin neighbour non-senescent tissue. This research \nline is being actively investigated in the lab.\nAnother goal in the laboratory is to study chromatin \nremodeling during tissue regeneration. Surviving \ncells of damaged tissues readapt their status to \nreconstruct the lost tissue. They undergo chromatin \nremodeling to activate or repress new batteries \nof genes, a process that may be affected by the \nactivation of retrotransposon LINE elements, which \nregulate global chromatin accessibility. The role \nof retrotransposons had not been studied during \nregeneration of Drosophila . We have found (Azpiazu \nand Morata 2022) that during regeneration, nuclear \nchromatin acquires an \u201cintermediate\u201d state that \nresembles the young embryonic totipotent state. \nMoreover, Roo and F-Element retrotransposons of \nDrosophila suffer profound changes in expression in \nthe first hours of embryonic development and also \nduring regeneration.Group Members\nPrincipal Investigators \n(PI, co-PI):\nGin\u00e9s Morata P\u00e9rez\nNatalia Azpiazu Torres\nScientific Staff:\nManuel Calleja Requena\nVisiting scientists:\nViviana Veladez Graham \n(from September 2022)\nPostdoctoral fellows:\nNoelia Pinal Seoane \n(until May 2021)Predoctoral fellows:\nIzarne Medina Azpiazu \n(until May 2021)\nJuan Manuel Garc\u00eda Arias\nTechnicians:\nAng\u00e9lica Cantarero Mateo\nRosa M \u00aa Gonz\u00e1lez Herrera\nUndergraduate and \nMaster Students:\nLaura Serrano (TFM)\nCelia Contreras (TFG)\nAlexandra Rico (TFG)\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/gmorataMECHANISMS OF TUMORIGENESIS IN DROSOPHILA79\nCell-Cell Communication & Inflammation Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nPortion of a wing imaginal disc of Drosophila containing a \nnumber of senescent cells, labelled red.

Traditionally considered a static mass, \ntoday it is widely recognized as a highly dynamic \nbiomaterial that confers mechanical strength to \ntissues, provides attachment and movement points \nto cells, and is also essential for the intercellular \ncommunication. Therefore, proper synthesis and \nassembly of the components of the ECM is essential \nfor cell and tissue homeostasis, and defects or \nalterations in these processes are associated with \nthe development of several human disorders, \nparticularly in the cardiovascular system. The \nbiosynthesis of collagen, the main component \nof the ECM, is a complex and highly regulated \nprocess involving numerous steps, including chain \nassociation and folding, extracellular secretion, \nproteolytic processing and cross-linking. A set \nof prolyl- and lysyl-hydroxylases, glycosidases, \nisomerases and lysyl oxidases catalyze an extensive \nseries of post-translational modifications, most of \nwhich are unique to collagen protein. In the last few \nyears our group has investigated different aspects \nof this biosynthetic pathway. To this respect, we \nhave focused our work in the study of the biology \nof lysyl oxidases (LOX), the enzymes responsible \nfor the collagen cross-linking, an essential post-\ntranslational modification that largely determines the biomechanical properties of the collagen. \nThe LOX family of matrix-remodeling enzymes is \ncomposed by 5 members, a canonical LOX and four \nLOX-like isoforms from 1 to 4 (LOXL1, LOXL2, LOXL3 \nand LOXL4). The activity of the canonical LOX and \nthe isoform LOXL1 are regulated by proteolysis and \nin the laboratory we have analyzed the molecular \ndeterminants of this proteolytic regulation. Our \nresults have shown the existence of a complex pattern \nfor the proteolysis of these LOX members, with \nmultiple proteases contributing to the extracellular \nprocessing of these enzymes. Additionally, we have \nstudied the regulation by hypoxia of several collagen \nremodeling enzymes, including lysyl- and prolyl-\nhydroxylases and analyzed the contribution of this \nhypoxic regulation to the development of fibrosis in \nseveral pathological contexts.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nFernando Rodr\u00edguez Pascual\nPostdoctoral Fellow: \nTamara Rosell Garc\u00eda (1/1/2021 al 29/10/2021)\nPostdoctoral Fellow: \nSergio Rivas Mu\u00f1oz (1/12/2021 al 30/11/2022)\nMaster Student: \nSilvia Alcaraz Romero  (22/10/2021 al 15/07/2022)EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX REMODELING IN THE CARDIOVASCULAR \nSYSTEM\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/frodriguez81\nCell-Cell Communication & Inflammation Unit\n CBM 2021-2022Location of BMP1 and ADAMTS14 cleavage sites within the tridimensional \nstructure of LOXL1 protein.

It gathers together ten labs (14 PIs) interested in understanding how \ncells control their shape and function to organize in complex tissues and organs in a cooperative \nmanner. We are interested in addressing how this organization is achieved, maintained, and \nadapted during development, homeostasis, and human disease through the precise temporal \nand spatial orchestration of gene expression and protein function. Multiple cellular processes, \nfrom transcription and translation to membrane transport and signal transduction, must be \ncoordinated through multilayered circuits in a cell-autonomous manner. Besides, the interaction \nbetween different cell types further coordinates these processes to ensure proper tissue structure \nand function, for example, by regulating asymmetric cell divisions, cellular communication, self-\nrenewal of progenitor cells, or expansion of specific cell types. Systems-biology studies suggest \nthat these processes are interconnected through a complex network of positive and negative \nfeedback loops, and understanding how cells integrate all these processes requires a coordinated \nmultidisciplinary approach. In the Cellarch  unit, several groups with expertise in these areas and \ngenome-wide studies use model organisms such as flies, worms, zebrafish, and mice to study \nhow cells integrate shape control gene expression and protein function in specific niches. These \nstudies address three significant aspects of these coordinated processes: \na)  Obtain advanced knowledge of the cellular differentiation processes through the functional \ncharacterization of the protein machinery involved in cell polarization, signaling, and cell \ncommunication.\nb)  Study the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development and homeostasis, \nand analyze how regulatory and genome structure variations can contribute to human \ndisease.\nc)  Integrate all this information within a specific tissue during normal physiology and \npathological conditions such as inflammation using in vivo models. \nGiven the number of molecular pathways involved, the Cellarch  unit will specifically investigate \nhow each of these cellular pathways modulates or interferes with the others, thus complementing \nthe areas investigated explicitly in each of the various labs. Thus, the Cellarch  research teams will \ncoordinate their efforts to build realistic models that will help us to gain a deeper understanding \nof normal physiology and human disease. Indeed, one of the main objectives of the Cellarch  unit \nis addressing the cell response to damage, diseases, and the physiological aging of organisms.\n85\nMiguel Angel Alonso Lebrero / \nIsabel Correas Hornero\nCELL POLARITY\nPaola Bovolenta \nMORPHOGENESIS AND \nNEURODEGENERATION OF THE \nVERTEBRATE CNS\nJose F. de Celis \nGENETIC ANALYSES OF \nSIGNALING PATHWAYS \nDURING EPITHELIAL \nDEVELOPMENT IN \nDROSOPHILA MELANOGASTERCarlos Estella /  \nAntonio Baonza \nCELLULAR RESPONSE TO  \nSTRESS AND MORPHOGENESIS\nMiguel Manzanares \nFUNCTIONAL GENOMICS\nFernando Martin Belmonte\nGROUP OF INTESTINAL \nMORPHOGENESIS AND \nHOMEOSTASIS\nNuria Mart\u00ednez Mart\u00edn\nMETABOLISM AND B CELL \nFUNCTION\nDavid G.

Our unit studies have advanced our \nunderstanding of how cells in the mammalian embryo transit from pluripotency to lineage specification, \nmost unexpectedly by the use of the same set of factors, such as Oct4 (Andreu MJ et al. 2022, Cell Report; \nTiana et al. 2022; Sci Adv; Alvarez-Franco A et al. 2021, Cardiovasc Res). \n \u00bbOther studies focused on identifying mechanisms that ensure the formation of the subcellular cytoskeleton \ncapable of supporting the cellular structure. We characterized that the SMTNL2 protein has an essential \nrole in the formation of microvilli that decorate the luminal membrane of mammalian enterocytes through \nthe regulation of the subapical actin cytoskeleton (Hachimi et al. 2021, Current Biol)). Also, one of our \ngroups demonstrated that While the binding of Rho GTPases to the N-terminal region of most formins \nactivates actin polymerization, calmodulin does so in the formin INF2 (Labat-de-Hoz et al., CMLS 2022). \nFurthermore, our unit has developed a coarse-grained model of a two-dimensional actomyosin cortex \nthat reproduces many essential aspects of actin filament and actomyosin network formation, such as \ndynamics of polymerization and depolymerization, treadmilling, network formation, and the autonomous \noscillatory dynamics of actomyosin (Hern\u00e1ndez-Del-Valle M et al. 2022, BMC Biol).\n \u00bbA significant part of the work carried out in our unit uses the drosophila model for its experiments. We are \ninterested in the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control cell fate specification and morphogenesis \nduring development. We discovered an essential molecular link connecting cell cycle progression and p53's \nproapoptotic activity, which coordinates the appropriate response following DNA damage (Velarde SB et \nal. 2021; Plos Biol). Another study also identified the genetic and molecular mechanisms that control glial \nresponse after nervous system damage (Ruiz-Losada M et al. 2022, Cell Death Differ). Additional analyses \nin drosophila have shown that the differences in signalling downstream of the Hedgehog morphogen \nmeasured between developing Drosophila organs are simply different states along the temporal dynamics \nof the pathway (Miguez et al., 2022, Development). A genome-wide genetic screen in the Drosophila wing \nusing ARN interference described the loss-of-function phenotype of 80% of Drosophila genes. Similarly, \na study uncovered a specific requirement of CUBAM in slit diaphragm degradation and recycling in the \nfly nephrocyte. Interestingly, this function might be conserved in vertebrate podocytes, as suggested \nby some clinical parameters present in patients with Imerslund-Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome carrying CUBN \nmutations (Atienza-Manuel et al. 2021, Development).Cell Architecture & Organogenesis Unit CBM 2021-202286\nTissue and Organ Homeostasis CBM 2021-2022\nSummarySummary\nOur aims during this period have been: 1) to study \nthe mechanism of biogenesis of the primary cilium \nin polarized epithelial cells, 2) to investigate the \nregulation of the formin INF2, and 3) to characterize \na novel member of the MAL family of proteins.\nPrevious work in our laboratory established a critical \nrole for the midbody remnant in primary cilium \nformation in polarized epithelial cells. We have now \nobserved that the majority of midbody remnants \nare physically connected to the plasma membrane \nthrough a membranous stalk derived from an \nintact arm of the cytokinetic bridge. Thanks to this \nphysical continuity, the midbody remnant delivers \na specialized membrane patch that the centrosome \nuses to build the ciliary membrane. Our study shows \nhow the ciliary membrane and the primary cilium \noriginate in polarized epithelial cells. \nFormins are a family of proteins involved in the \nassembly of actin filaments. Most formins, such \nas mDia1, contain a diaphanous inhibitory domain \n(DID) at the N-terminal region that interacts with \nthe C-terminal region to maintain the molecule \nin an inactive state. mDia1 and other formins are \nregulated by the binding of Rho GTPases to the \nDID. INF2 is a formin linked to inherited renal and \nneurological disease in humans. INF2 possesses \nan N-terminal extension of unknown structure \nand function that precedes the DID. Our work has demonstrated that this extension is organized \ninto two \u03b1 -helices, the first of which interacts \ndirectly with Ca2+/calmodulin through a peptide \nmotif that is conserved in vertebrates. Consistent \nwith this interaction, INF2 produces massive actin \npolymerization in response to increased Ca2+ levels. \nOur study reveals that, unlike other formins, INF2 is \nregulated by interaction of Ca2+/calmodulin with the \nINF2 N-terminal extension.\nThe MAL family of proteins has been the focus of \nour laboratory\u2019s research for a long time. Our third \nproject has dealt with the characterization of MALL, \na membrane tetraspanning member of this family. \nWe have found endogenous MALL in membranes \nand, unexpectedly, in nuclear-membraneless \nstructures, the PML bodies. Our study suggests that \nMALL can adopt a membrane-embedded or a water-\nsoluble conformation depending on its physical \nenvironment \u2014lipidic or aqueous\u2014 in the cell. \nDuring mitosis, overexpressed MALL aggregates \nat the cytokinetic bridge into large solid structures \nthat produce cytokinesis failure and lead to cells \nwith aberrant chromosome content. Since MALL is \noverexpressed in some types of cancer, an excess \nof MALL could contribute to malignancy by inducing \nchromosome instability.\nCELL POLARITY\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/maalonsoGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nMiguel Angel Alonso Lebrero\nIsabel Correas Hornero\nPostdoctoral fellows:\nOlga Ant\u00f3n Hurtado \nPredoctoral fellows:\nArmando Rubio Ramos\nLeticia Labat de Hoz\nTechnician:\nLaura Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00edn87\nCell Architecture & Organogenesis Unit\n CBM 2021-2022Structure and regulation of INF2.

Variations in the necessary developmental \nprograms often cause congenital malformations, \nwhereas loss of an efficient CNS homeostasis leads to \nprogressive aging or neurodegenerative conditions. \nOur team seeks to understand these events focusing, \non one side, on early vertebrate eye morphogenesis \nand, on the other, on the implication that Secreted \nFrizzled Related Protein 1 (SFRP1) has in Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease (AD) pathogenesis.  \nWe have demonstrated that the presumptive retinal \npigment epithelium (RPE) of the eye is required for eye \nmorphogenesis with a species-specific mechanism \nthat varies between teleost and amniotes. In teleosts, \nRPE cells undergo a profound cell shape change by \nstrongly reducing their apico-basal axis while enlarging \ntheir surface area through an important cytoskeletal \nreorganization. This transformation occurs in the \nabsence of cell proliferation and generates mechanical \nforces that contribute eye morphogenesis. The gene \nregulatory network that governs this transformation \ninclude transcription factors that control the \nexpression onset of cell adhesion and cytoskeletal \ncomponents (collaboration with JR Martinez-Morales, CABD, CSIC-UPO). This mechanism differs in \namniotes, in which the RPE grows mostly through cell \nproliferation, which, in different species, is inversely \nproportional to the length of the apico-basal axis, so \nthat in human RPE progenitors are highly proliferative \nand quite elongated in shape. We thus propose that \nzebrafish RPE stretching and fast differentiation are \ntwo efficient mechanisms that enable the RPE to reach \nthe size needed for optic vesicle folding when this \nprocess takes less time than the cell cycle.\nRelated to neurodegeneration, we pursued our \nobservation that SFRP1, a small secreted protein \nfound in the brain matrisome and mostly produced \nby astrocytes and choroid plexus cells, is involved \nin AD pathogenesis. We have now shown that \nastrocyte-derived SFRP1 promotes and sustains \nmicroglial activation via the upregulation of \ncomponents of HIF-dependent inflammatory \npathway, thereby acting as an astrocyte to microglia \namplifier of neuroinflammation. By generating a \ntransgenic mouse model that overexpresses Sfrp1 \nin astrocytes, we have also shown that high SFRP1 \nlevels cause an age-dependent loss of hippocampal \ndendritic spines with poor cognitive performance \nand reduced response to long-term potentiation.

We use the Drosophila \nmelanogaster  wing as our main experimental model \nand we carry out three research projects. The \nfirst project involves the analysis of the functional \nrequirements of Drosophila  genes in the wing. \nWe grouped the 14.000 Drosophila  genes into 16 \nfunctional groups (Fig. 1) and screened UAS-RNAi \nlines targeting 10918 of these genes. We classified \nthe resulting phenotypes into morphological classes \naffecting the size, pattern or differentiation of the \nwing (Fig. 1), and correlated each mutant phenotype \nwith the expression of the corresponding gene. \nWing phenotypes reveal functional requirements, \neither in basic cellular functions impinging on cell \nviability or in wing-specific functions related to its \ngrowth and patterning, and together with gene \nexpression patterns constitute an optimal entry \npoint to undertake detailed functional analysis. The \nsecond project is the analysis of the transcriptional \neffects of one Drosophila  transcription factor (Spalt) \nthat has a prominent role in the development of \nthe wing disc. Spalt is a nuclear protein containing \nthree pairs of Zn fingers and its human orthologs \nare involved in Towles-Brokes disease and Okihiro \nsyndrome. We have identified a minimal DNA response element for Spalt through the analysis \nof the regulatory region of one of its downstream \ngenes and now we are defining the effects of Spalt \non chromatin conformation as well as searching \nfor Spalt co-repressors with the objective of \nunderstanding the Spalt mechanism of action. The \nthird project concerns the Ras gene. Mutations in \nhuman Ras are common in multitude of cancers, \nand the Drosophila  Ras gene has been used to model \ncancer progression in flies.  Using Crisper/Cas9 and \nhomologous recombination we have generated \nDrosophila  transgenic lines carrying altered \nversions of the fly and human Ras genes. We are \ncharacterizing the consequences of activating Ras \nmutations when the gene is expressed at normal \nlevels in the wing, the ovary and the lymph gland. \nWe expect to generate genetic combinations in a \nbackground of endogenous activated Ras allowing \nus to model the formation and progression of \ntumors.Group Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nJose F. de Celis \nScientific Staff:\nAna Ruiz G\u00f6mez\nDiego Pulido Vega\nPredoctoral fellow:\nPatricia Vega Cuesta \nCristina Mart\u00ednez Ostal\u00e9 (until September 2022)\nTechnician:\nAna L\u00f3pez Varea \nMaster Student 2021:\nJousef Issa Garc\u00eda91\nCell Architecture & Organogenesis Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nImage of the wing imaginal disc surface (central circle) showing the DNA (blue), Actine (red) and Tubulin (light blue) of mitotic cells.

This becomes particularly important after \ncellular or tissue injury, as organs must compensate \nfor cell loss during the regeneration process. Defects \nin the precise coordination between cell proliferation \nand cell death or apoptosis could trigger tumor \ndevelopment and organ malformations.\nOur main general aim is to understand how cells \nrespond to different stresses to maintain tissue \nhomeostasis. In addition, we are interested in the \nmolecular and cellular mechanisms that control \ncell fate specification and morphogenesis during \ndevelopment. To this end we use Drosophila as our \nmodel organism because its genomic conservation \n(Drosophila genome is 60% homologous to that of \nhumans) and its powerful genetic tools that allow \nus to easily manipulate gene expression making this \norganism ideal for modelling human diseases. Our main research lines are: \n1.  How appendages are formed? We study the \nmolecular and cellular mechanisms that control \nappendage specification and morphogenesis. \nAt cellular and molecular level, a small number \nof signaling pathways, transcription factors and \ncell behaviors are reiteratively used throughout \ndevelopment to generate a three-dimensional \nappendage in Drosophila and in vertebrates. \n2.  Coordination between cell proliferation and \napoptosis during tissue homeostasis. The \nmechanisms that control cell proliferation and \napoptosis in response to different types of \nstress must be tightly coordinated and balance \nto maintain genomic integrity and prevent \ntumor development. Defective cells must be \nrapidly eliminated to prevent the transmission \nof mutations and the formation of malignant \ncells. What are the molecular mechanisms that \nlink together cell division and cell death is an \nimportant question with huge implications in the \nfield of cancer biology.Group Members\nPrincipal Investigators \n(PI, co-PI):\nCarlos Estella (co PI)\nAntonio Baonza (co-PI)\nPredoctoral fellows:\nMireya Ruiz-Losada \nSara Tur-Gracia \nMarina P\u00e9rez Aguilera \n(JAE and Investigo contract)\nClara Agudo  \n(JAE contract until February \n2021)\nTechnicians:\nAlonso Rodr\u00edguez \n(Research Assistant CAM)Undergraduate and \nMaster Students:\nSilvia de la Morena \nSaavedra  \n(TFM until June 2021) \nAlejandra Garc\u00eda  \n(TFG until June 2021)\nJavier Pereira  \n(TFG until June 2022)\nSara Cristobal  \n(TFM until June 2022)\nGonzalo Garc\u00eda Gir\u00f3n \n(TFM until June 2022)\nSara de Pablo Vinader \n(TFG)\nPaula Gil Cort\u00e9s (TFM)\nDaniel Felipe  \n(JAE contract, TFG)\nIn\u00e9s Kelleher  \n(JAE contract, TFM)93\nCell Architecture & Organogenesis Unit\n CBM 2021-2022Other activities\n \u00bbAntonio Baonza and Carlos Estella are Associated Editors \nof the research topic \u201cRegulation and Coordination of \nthe Different DNA Damage Responses and their Role in \nTissue Homeostasis Maintenance\u201d in Frontiers in Cell and \nDevelopmental Biology. \n \u00bbAntonio Baonza is Associate Editor of the Journal Heliyon \n(Cell press), \n \u00bbAntonio Baonza was a Visiting Researcher (10/2019-\n03/2021) at Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, \nUniversity Oxford.

Regeneration is the ability that \nsome organisms present to repair damaged \norgans or tissues. This ability differs, not only \nbetween different species, but also between \ndifferent stages of development of the same \norganism. One of our goals is to identify the cellular \nsignals that promote and limit the regenerative \ncapacity of an organism during development.When neural tissue is damaged, a regenerative \nresponse is induced, aiminig to preserve the \nstructural integrity and function of the nervous \nsystem. This regenerative response is mostly \nmediated by glial cells. We investigate the genetic \nand molecular mechanisms that control glial \nresponse after damage. 94\nTissue and Organ Homeostasis CBM 2021-2022\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nMiguel Manzanares \nPostdoctoral fellow:\nMaria Tiana (since September 2021)\nElva Martin Batista (since November 2021)\nPredoctoral fellow:\nAntonio Barral (since December 2022)\nVisiting scientist :\nAntonio Barral (March 2021-November 2022)\nMarta Portela  (since March 2021)\nAlba Alvarez-Franco  (March-November 2021)FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/functional-genomics\nSummary\nThe present and future research objectives of our \ngroup are to understand, on the one hand, how \ngenome activity is regulated during the early stages \nof mammalian development, and on the other, how \nregulatory and structural variations of the genome \ncan contribute to human disease. To do this, we \nsearch for and identify cis regulatory sequences, \nand we study how they act on their target genes, \nhow they are organized along the 3D structure of \nchromatin and their role in the gene regulatory \nnetworks that underlie a specific biological state. \nMethodologically, we used a combination of \nbioinformatics and data analysis tools, structural \ngenomics, genome-wide analysis, gene editing \nusing the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and functional \nassays in transgenic animals and pluripotent stem \ncells.\nWe explore this field using a model in which we \nhave demonstrated our experience and to which \nwe have made relevant contributions: the early \nstages of embryonic development in mammals. \nWe are experts in the study of the initial phases of \nmouse development from one cell to the blastocyst \nof barely a hundred. This is an ideal model, where \nthe combination of genetic, pharmacological, and \nexperimental embryology tools allow analyzing key processes and questions, such as the appearance \nof the first differences between cell types that \noccur in the embryo. In addition, we are pioneers \nin developing omics approaches where we can \ninterrogate gene expression or chromatin structure \nin individual mouse embryos of just a dozen cells. We \nextend these studies in the embryo with the use of \npluripotent stem cells, as a complementary system \nin culture in which we have extensive experience. \nAlso, we will fine-tune the use of gastruloids, \nembryonic organoids, as an experimental system.\nIn addition, we want to understand how the \nprogressive loss of differentiation capacity of the \nembryo cells occurs, from the totipotent state \npresent in the zygote to the gastrulation phases of \nthe embryo. We hypothesize that this knowledge \nwill also allow us to reprogram gene networks in \nadults in order to initiate regeneration processes in \nsituations of tissue damage. The future of research \nin our group will be based on the achievements and \nobjectives set out above, with the ultimate goal of \nanswering a basic question: how does the genome \nact in a coordinated way to give rise to differences \nbetween cell types, stages of development, \norganisms, or disease states.95\nCell Architecture & Organogenesis Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nConfocal image of a 6-cell mouse embryo, where the nuclei are stained \nwidth DAPI (cyan), and the GATA3 protein is detected by a specific antibody \n(magenta)\nList of publications\n \u00bbAndreu MJ, Alvarez-Franco A, Portela M*, Gimenez-\nLlorente D, Cuadrado A, Badia-Careaga C, Tiana M, Losada \nA, Manzanares M (2022).

In addition, my lab has initiated \na new line of research using mouse embryonic stem \ncells (mES) to address epithelial formation and \nstudy asymmetric division in the development of \nthe intestine.\nThe intestinal tract plays a fundamental role in \ndevelopment, regeneration, immunity and nutrition. \nMany critical aspects of intestinal development \nand function remain unexplored despite their \nrelevance. For instance, the contribution of neonatal \nenterocytes in the metabolic crosstalk with \nmicrobiota and immune cells to reach homeostasis \nis fairly unknown. In our laboratory, we propose \na multidisciplinary approach to understanding \nbetter the molecular mechanisms associated with \nformation, patterning and metabolism in intestinal \nmorphogenesis and homeostasis.A complete understanding of the molecular \nprocesses we intend to address will yield important \nnew insights into intestinal development and \nhomeostasis in vertebrates. It will also reveal new \nopportunities to discover pharmaceutical targets \nin human disease. Cancer is one of the leading \ncauses of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with \ncolorectal cancer (CRC) being especially prevalent \namong the elderly.

This response \nrelies on the activation of several immune cells; \namong them, activation of B lymphocytes is crucial, \ngiving place to the production of specific high-affinity \nantibody-producing cells (plasma cells, PC) and \nmemory B cells (MBC). Activated B cells proliferate \nand differentiate, originating a macroscopic \nstructure within the follicles of secondary lymphoid \norgans known as Germinal Centers (GC). In GCs, B \ncells proliferate and differentiate into PC and MBC. \nDeciphering molecular mechanisms controlling \nGC initiation and how different pathogens trigger \nthis initiation have attracted the attention of \nimmunologists. In this regard, GC initiation entails \ncritical metabolic changes in the immune cells. Thus, \nthe characterisation of the metabolic profile of each \nimmune cell and understanding how metabolism \ninstructs intrinsic cell activation, proliferation, and \ndifferentiation in the GC has become an essential \nfield of study. However, GC is a double-edged \nsword: while a deficient GC initiation can lead to \nimmunodeficiencies, an overactivation of GC can \nlead to GC-derived lymphomas or autoimmune \ndiseases. Therefore, in addition to GC initiation, \nthe processes leading to the GC reaction and \ntermination of the cellular expansion are also of \nhigh scientific and clinical interest. We have generated data demonstrating the role \nof mitochondria during the GC reaction, shaping \nintrinsic B cell function. Moreover, we have \nevidence suggesting that the metabolic activity of B \nlymphocytes impacts B cells themselves and instructs \nthe metabolic rewiring and fate differentiation of \nneighbouring T lymphocytes. We have defined this \nprocess as \u00a8metabolic communication\u00a8. We believe \nthis process should be fundamental during the GC \nreaction, shaping initiation and shutdown of the \nimmune response.\nImportantly, our work has taken us to develop state-\nof-the-art techniques based on flow cytometry \nto evaluate B cell metabolism during the immune \nresponse, such as a technique to quantify the \nrelative amount of ATP in live cells. \nOur laboratory aims to apply multi-omics and \nfunctional approaches in genetically modified mice \nwith a dysfunctional metabolism to characterise \nthe \u00a8metabolic communication\u00a8 and identify all the \nmolecular entities that mediate it. Moreover, we \nwill evaluate its role in GC initiation, depending on \nthe pathogen\u00b4s nature and the GC shutdown. The \nobtained information will be evaluated in terms of \nits therapeutic potential in B cell lymphomas and \nautoimmune diseases and to improve, in the future, \nvaccination strategies. 99\nCell Architecture & Organogenesis Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nStudy of the cell-intrinsic and paracrine mechanism of B cell metabolism during the immune response. \nList of publications\n \u00bbIborra-Pernichi M, Ru\u00edz J, Mart\u00ednez-Mart\u00edn N.

This way, extracellular stimuli triggers \npathways of biological events that regulate gene \nexpression, protein activity, and ultimately, cell \nresponse. The architecture of these signaling \ncascades is highly nonlinear, integrating multiple \nlayers and loops of feedback and feedforward \nregulation. These nonlinearities strongly affect \nthe dynamics of activation and de-activation of the \nsignaling cascades, inducing emerging properties \nsuch as bistability, oscillations or ultra-sensitivity. To understand cellular decisions, it is not sufficient \nto understand the function of each of the proteins \nin a pathway, and a deep understanding of the \nconsequences of the nonlinear wiring of the \npathway is required. We use in vivo experiments \nand theoretical approaches to understand how \nthe wiring of the pathways affects the role of \nthe proteins that regulate these decision, in the \ncontext of balance between proliferation and \ndifferentiation of stems cells during neurogenesis.101\nCell Architecture & Organogenesis Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nSections of  developing zebrafish retinas stained with Sox2 (orange) and Atho5 (green) for contron (left) and treatment with the Hh \ninhibitor Cyclopamin (right)\nList of publications\n \u00bbHern\u00e1ndez-Del-Valle, M., Valencia-Exp\u00f3sito, A., Gorfinkiel, \nN., Mart\u00edn-Bermudo, M.D., M\u00edguez, D.G., (2022).

Hence, the challenge and \nthe main goal of our research is to advance in \nunderstanding the molecular mechanisms involved \nin SD formation and stability, by identifying novel \nSD components and dissecting the major signalling \nevents that regulate SD dynamics in normal and \npathological conditions. These studies should \nfacilitate the detection of novel therapeutic targets, \nthus helping to reach an early CDK diagnosis. Due \nto the conservation of SDs across species, in the \nlaboratory we opted to combine the use of two \nmodel organisms: Drosophila melanogaster  and the \nzebrafish Danio rerio  to achieve these main goals. \nFirst, we take advantage of the versatility of the \ngenetic techniques used and the ease of obtaining \ntransgenic animals quickly and cheaply in Drosophila , \nto identify novel SD components and regulators in nephrocytes, the fly excretory cells involved in \nhaemolymph ultrafiltration, which our previous \nwork and that of other researchers has proved to \nbe a suitable model to study nephropathies and SD \ndynamics. And subsequently, we validate the novel \ngenes and proposed mechanisms in vertebrates \nusing the zebrafish.\nIn the last two years we have focused in dissecting \nthe requirement of the endocytic receptor CUBAM \nfor the correct positioning of SDs, suggesting \nits possible and conserved role in SD recycling \n(Atienza-Manuel et al., 2021) and in the functional \ncharacterisation of a novel gene, scramb1 , which \nencodes a phospholipid scramblase essential for \nthe assembly of the nephrocyte SD. Our studies \nrevealed that Scramb1 is a component of the fly \nSD interactome, required for the recruitment of a \nmain structural SD protein, that Scramb1 activity \nis regulated by Ca2+, and suggest that the correct \ntargeting of Scramb1 to lipid raft microdomains is \ncritical for SD assembly. We have also characterised \nthe Scramb1 interactome by immunoprecipitation \nunder native conditions and the identification of its \ninteractants by mass spectrometry techniques, and \nare now validating these interactants.Group Members\nPrincipal Investigators:\nMar Ruiz G\u00f3mez (PI)\nJoaquim Cul\u00ed Espigul \n(co-PI)\n\u201cAd Honorem\u201d \nProfessor:\nJuan Modolell Mainou\nScientific Staff:\nSonsoles Campuzano \nCorralesPostdoctoral fellows:\nMarta Carrasco Rando\nPredoctoral fellows:\nVicente Castillo Mancho\nTechnicians:\nRa\u00fal Somavilla Cabrero \n(from May 2021)\nMaster Students:\nJorge Sarmiento Jim\u00e9nez \n(2021)103\nCell Architecture & Organogenesis Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nTEM micrographs, immunostainings and schemes, showing the location and composition of the slit diaphragm (SD) in vertebrate \npodocytes and Drosophila nephrocytes\nList of publications\n \u00bbAtienza-Manuel, A., Castillo-Mancho, V., De Renzis, S., \nCuli, J. and Ruiz-G\u00f3mez, M.

We have studied in Drosophila the \nrole of the Hox gene Abdominal-B (Abd-B) in the \ndevelopment of the posterior abdomen and in testes \ndevelopment. The seventh abdominal segment (A7) \nof the Drosophila male requires Abd-B and also the \nactivity of the Hox cofactors Extradenticle (Exd) and \nHomothorax (Hth).  Hth is needed to maintain Abd-B \nexpression in this segment and Abd-B can repress \nexd and hth when expressed at high levels. A domain \nN-terminal to the homeodomain, the DNA-binding \ndomain of Hox proteins, contains a tryptophane \nconserved in all Hox proteins that contacts the Exd \nprotein. Although we have shown by Bifluorescence \nComplementation that Exd and Abd-B physically \ninteract, the tryptophane is not required for this \ninteraction or for Abd-B activity. The change of \nthis aminoacid to an Alanine, however, increases \nAbd-B activity, as do other changes in the Abd-B \nprotein, especially modifications in a sequence just \nC-terminal to the homeodomain. The male gonads show a spherical shape in larva \nbut elongate and coil during pupal stages to achieve \ntheir adult size and shape. This change depends on \nthe interaction between the testis and muscle cells \nfrom the genital disc, a structure that develops at \nthe back of the larva. These muscle cells migrate and \nsurround the gonad in pupa, and at the same time the \ntestis elongate and coil. We have found that Abd-B \nis essential for the migration of muscle cells from \nthe genital disc and the elongation of testes. This \nelongation also requires the activity of the Notch, \nFGF and the sex determination pathways. Abd-B \ncodes for two proteins, both required for testes \ndevelopment. The Abd-BM protein is expressed in \nthe testes, and needed autonomously for their initial \nshort elongation, and also expressed in the genital \ndisc, and required there non-autonomously for the \nposterior major elongation and coiling of the testes. \nThe Abd-BR protein is expressed in the genital disc \nand needed for the contact between genital disc and \ntestes. Abd-B also regulates the dextral direction of \ncoiling by controlling the expression, in the testes, of \nMyosinID. In the absence of this Hox gene testes can \ncoil dextrally, sinistrally or do not coil. These results \nshow that Abd-B is a key gene for the elongation \nand dextral coiling of Drosophila testes.105\nCell Architecture & Organogenesis Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nDetail of a testis (t), vas deferens (vd) and \nparagonia (p) of a Drosophila male stained \nwith tropomyosin (white), Abdominal-B (blue), \nphalloidin (green) and Topro (red). \nList of publications\n \u00bbEden W.

The nervous \nsystem of male and females is sexually different \nat the molecular and structural levels. These \ndifferences lead to sex biases in the age of onset, \nprevalence, symptomatology and treatment for \nnearly every neuropsychiatric disorder. The general \naim of our laboratory is to decipher the genetic and \nmolecular mechanisms that control sex dependent \nconfigurations of the nervous system. Most sex \ndifferences are caused by sex hormones, however \nthere is robust evidence that points to genetic \nfactors also contributing to sexual dimorphisms.\nThe ancient family of DMRT  genes encode conserved \ntranscription factors involved in the regulation \nof sexual features in every animal species so far \nstudied. However, the role of Dmrts in the vertebrate \nnervous system has not been profusely investigated. \nWe are approaching this question using genetic \nand genomic techniques in mice. We propose that \nDMRTs control sex-specific neuron identities and \nnumbers, connectivity and constriction of sexual transcriptional differences in cooperation with sex-\nlinked factors and sex-specific splicing mechanisms. \nWe are also interested in conserved DMRT  functions \nin humans and how specific DMRTs  genetic variants \ncould contribute to the onset and sexual bias of \npsychiatric disorders. Our work will unravel novel \nprinciples of brain sexual differentiation and will \ngenerate mouse models to better understand \ngenetic mechanisms that either afford protection \nor generate vulnerability in the etiology and sexual \nbias of mental disorders.107\nCell Architecture & Organogenesis Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nThe gates of the rodent behavior (credit Rafael Casado-Navarro).\nList of publications\n \u00bbCasado-Navarro R and Serrano-Saiz E.

At the \npresent, we are analyzing those functions and we \ncontinue with the study of the possible role of tau \nin Alzheimer disease (AD) and other tauopathies. \nDuring 2021-2022, we have tested: a) the presence of \ntau in non-neuronal cells, b) the presence of new tau \nisoform and c) we have started to look for a possible \nspecific role of tau in neuronal aging, since aging is \nthe main risk factor for Alzheimer disease.\nAbout the presence of tau in non-neuronal cells, we \nhave found that tau could be present in microglia \ncells, being that presence the consequence of the \nendocytosis of extracellular (neuronal) tau into \nmicroglia cells. Also, we have found that the effect \nof tau in microglia cells results in the activation of \np38 kinase that could be toxic for the cell. In that \nway, inhibition of p38 kinase decreases tau toxicity \nin microglia cells and improves microglia phagocytic \nfunction. Additionally, tau expression was found \nin kidney cells playing, this kidney tau, a role in \npodocyte architecture.\nA new tau isoform raised by intron 12 retention has \nbeen described. This new tau isoform contains an \nextra 16aa peptide, only present in humans, with \ntwo tryptophan residues and we named it as W-Tau \nisoform. Looking at W-Tau isoform, we have found that it has a low capacity for self-aggregation, \nunlike of the previously known human tau isoforms. \nAlso, W-Tau isoform could prevent the aggregation \nof the other tau isoforms. In vitro experiments, \nusing the 16aa peptide, specific for W-Tau, have \nindicated that such peptide could prevent not only \ntau self-assembly but also beta amyloid peptide \naggregation.\nDuring this period, we have studied aging at the \ndentate gyrus (DG) and hippocampal region of \nold mice, since DG is one of the regions that are \nearlier affected in AD. Previously, we described, \nin vivo , that aging features in DG from old mice \ncould be ameliorated expressing the so-called \nYamanaka Factors (YF). Now, we are looking for \nmore simple factors that could replace the action of \nYF and starting to look for a specific tau function in \nneuronal aging.\nFinally, our group has done several collaborations, \nlocated inside and outside of the CBMSO, in \naspects related to Alzheimer disease and other \nneurodegenerative disorders like aging.http://www.cbm.uam.es/javilaTAU FUNCTION AND DYSFUNCTIONS IN ALZHEIMER DISEASE\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigators \n(PI, co-PI):\n Jes\u00fas Avila de Grado, \nF\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez P\u00e9rez\nScientific Staff: \nVega Garc\u00eda-Escudero\nAlejandro Ant\u00f3n\nPostdoctoral fellows: \nLaura Vall\u00e9s\nPredoctoral fellows: \nDaniel RuizTechnicians: \nRaquel Cuadros\nRoc\u00edo Peinado\nNuria de la Torre\nUndergraduate and \nMaster Students: \nAlmudena Carnero \nEspejo\nMarta Rold\u00e1n L\u00e1zaro113\nMolecular Neuropathology Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nDoctoral theses\n \u00bbLaura Vall\u00e9s Saiz (2022).

Based on \nprevious results of degeneration induced by herpes \nsimplex 1 virus (HSV-1), we are focused on the endo-\nlysosomal pathway and cholesterol metabolism as \nmajor functions mediating HSV-1 induced, AD-like \nneurodegeneration. \nTo expand the screening of these pathways, we have \nrecently started to develop 2D and 3D neural models \nderived from the human progenitors LUHMES and \nReN cell lines. We have been able to obtain different \nneural types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and \nneurons), and proved the ability of both progenitors \nand differentiated cells to resemble an AD-like \nphenotype that includes intracellular accumulation \nof A\u03b2 and hyperphosphorylated tau, inhibition of \nA\u03b2 secretion, alterations in autophagy-lysosomal \npathway and changes in cholesterol levels, \nfollowing HSV-1 infection. These preliminary results \npave the way for the development of interesting \nresearch platforms, in which we plan to validate \ncandidate genes like LAMP2 and MMP14 and to \ndeepen our knowledge about the link between \ncholesterol and lysosome alterations and the AD like \nneurodegeneration induced by HSV-1.To evaluate the translational potential of findings \nobtained in the models, we are analyzing genes and \nbiomarkers in samples of controls and AD patients at \ndementia and pre-dementia stages. Putting together \nthe urgent need of peripheral biomarkers and the \nwidely supported involvement of the immune system \nin AD, we have selected peripheral blood mononuclear \ncells (PBMCs) as the material to be screened. \nMeasurement of PBMC free cholesterol levels in \ntwo independent case-control samples totaling 480 \nparticipants revealed decreased cholesterol content \nin patients from early, pre-dementia disease stages, \nas well as in control subjects bearing the APOE4 allele. \nWe also detected increased CD16+ and decreased \nCD8+ cell percentages in patients with moderate or \nsevere dementia. These results support the presence \nof changes in peripheral blood cells of AD patients and \nsuggest that alterations of cholesterol metabolism in \nthese cells could be prodromal events. In addition, \nthey suggest a relationship between APOE genotype \nand cholesterol levels in PBMC, which could manifest \neven in healthy individuals and perhaps partly explain \nthe involvement of APOE4 in AD.\nTherefore, our studies in cell models and patients \ncontinues supporting that failures of lysosomal \nfunction and cholesterol homeostasis are relevant \nin neurodegeneration, with the candidates under \nstudy having the potential to be early biomarkers or \npharmacological targets for AD.Group Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nMar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Bullido \nG\u00f3mez-Heras \nScientific Staff:\nJes\u00fas Aldudo Soto\nMar\u00eda Recuero Vicente\nTechnicians:\nIsabel Sastre Merl\u00edn \n(co-IP Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9rnandez \nPiqueras) \nPredoctoral Fellows: \nBlanca Salgado Fuentes \n(October 2022)Undergraduate and \nMaster Students \nJaime Morales Garc\u00eda \n(until September 2021)\nV\u00edctor Mej\u00edas P\u00e9rez\n(until September 2021)\nBlanca Salgado Fuentes \n(November 2021-September \n2022) \nBeatriz Izquierdo Alarc\u00f3n \n(February-June 2021)\nDaniel Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00edaz \n(February-June 2022)PATHOGENIC MECHANISMS OF ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE115\nMolecular Neuropathology Unit\n CBM 2021-2022LUHMES neurons on day 7 of differentiation labeled with MAP2 \n(red) and B-III tubulin (green) specific antibodies.

Adequate myelination is \nessential for the correct transmission of the nerve \nimpulse. In the CNS, oligodendrocytes (OLs) are the \nresponsible cells for myelination of neuronal axons, \nthrough a complex process that requires multiple \ncellular interactions. In the absence of a correct \nmyelination, diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis or \nleukodystrophies appear, currently orphans of an \neffective treatment. The possibility of generating \ntherapies based on the neurological component of \nthese diseases could stimulate the regeneration of \nnew oligodendrocytes or increase the capacity of \nthe remaining set of oligodendrocytes to produce \nmore myelin and reestablish correct myelination. Our group has demonstrated the importance of \nthe GTPases R-Ras1 and R-Ras2, essential proteins \nin the differentiation and survival of OLs. Moreover, \nwe have described the relevance of their presence \nfor the maintenance of energetic homeostasis and \nfor the correct functioning of the nerve impulse \ntransmission. Models lacking R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 \nfaithfully reproduce the symptomatological \ncharacteristics of myelin diseases and could be used \nas models for the development of new treatments \nbased on the neurological component.MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF OLIGODENDROCYTE-NEURON \nINTERACTION AND MYELIN PATHOLOGIES \nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nBeatriz Cubelos \nPredoctoral fellows\nBerta Alcover S\u00e1nchez (since 2019)\nGonzalo Garc\u00eda Mart\u00edn (since 2021)\nBrian Ernie Quinones (since 2022)\nUndergraduate and Master Students\nRosa Plaza Clavero  (2022)\nAndrea Alcaraz Ram\u00edrez (2022)\nGonzalo Garc\u00eda Mart\u00edn  (2021)\nJorge Navarro Nadal  (2021)\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/bcubelos117\nMolecular Neuropathology Unit\n CBM 2021-2022Figure: (a) Loss of oligodendrocytes \nin mutant mice lacking from R-Ras1, \nR-Ras2, or both.

We try \nto elucidate the molecular basis of this disease and \ndevelop novel therapies.\nFriedreich's ataxia is caused by a deficiency \nof frataxin, a protein that mainly localizes to \nmitochondria. In addition to the neurodegenerative \nprocess, which mainly affects to the spinal cord \nand the cerebellum, many patients also develop a \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy and diabetes. For \nthis reason, and despite of being a very early onset \ndisease, Friedreich's ataxia may also serve as a \nuseful model for the study of degenerative diseases \nassociated with aging in which mitochondrial \ndysfunction plays an important role. We have developed distinct neural cell models to \nstudy the molecular mechanisms underlying the \ndegenerative process triggered by the frataxin \ndeficiency both in neurons and in astrocytes. These \ncell models are also being used to test potential \ntherapeutic strategies, particularly those focused \non identifying molecules (drugs or genes) capable \nof compensating for the functional defects induced \nby the loss of frataxin, or that are capable of \nefficiently increasing the expression of frataxin. In \nthis context we have described that an agonist of the \nSonic Hedgehog signalling pathway SAG reduces \nmitochondrial dysfunction and neurotoxicity of \nfrataxin-deficient astrocytes.\nCurrently we are characterizing a novel mouse \nmodel for Friedreich\u2019s ataxia in which we have \nobserved an increase in glial reactivity followed by \nneurodegeneration in the cerebellum.

These functions depend \non the activity of complex neural networks in \nour forebrain. As we age or due to neurological \nor psychiatric disorders, these networks lose \nfunctionality caused by the dysfunction and loss \nof synapses and eventually neurodegenerative \nevents. In the development of the mammalian \ncentral nervous system there are periods of active \nsynaptogenesis and synaptic remodeling, driven \nby sensory experience and essential for the proper \nconfiguration of adult neural networks. Until we \nunderstand in depth how these high synaptic \nplasticity events work and how to induce them, it will \nbe difficult to imagine actions to prevent, alleviate or \nrecover the loss of cognitive functionality associated \nwith age or pathologies. In our laboratory, we \nhave been able to reproduce several features \nof these periods of high plasticity using in vitro \nmodels based on primary cultures of dissociated \nembryonic neurons. We have found that neuronal \nelectrical activity is critical and want to understand \nthe underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. \nTo this end, we are focused on determining how \nsynaptic activity, and more specifically, local \nintracellular calcium (Ca+2) oscillations modulate \nsignaling pathways leading to synapse production \nand reinvigoration. Calmodulin (CaM), a calcium-\nbinding protein, transduces Ca+2 oscillations into intracellular signaling events that lead to short-term \nand long-term effects, including the modulation of \ngene expression patterns. CaM activity is locally \nregulated by proteins such as Neurogranin (Ng), \nan abundant CaM-sequestering protein in the \npost-synaptic compartment of forebrain neurons. \nNg brain levels and cognitive performance are \nclosely and directly correlated in the human brain. \nTherefore, we have set as our research goals the \nstudy of the regulation of Ng expression and its \nfunctional role in the postsynaptic environment. \nWe use techniques in the areas of biochemistry, \ncellular and molecular biology, gene expression \nmanipulation, transcriptomics, proteomics and \nadvanced light microscopy and image analysis, and \nbuild genetically-encoded biosensors, to identify \nthe actors and the interactions that are relevant for \nsynaptic generation and remodeling. We propose \nNg as a target for strategies to prevent, alleviate \nor cure impaired cognitive function. Since Ng \nexpression is restricted to some forebrain areas \nand late developmental stages, interventions to \npromote Ng expression will be likely devoid of \nundesired side-effects. In summary, a deeper \nunderstanding of the role of CaM-sequestering \nproteins in synaptic plasticity will make it possible \nto develop new therapies to improve cognitive \nfunctions and quality of life of aging individuals and \npatients of neurological diseases.http://www.cbm.uam.es/fjdiezGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nFco.

What mechanism could \nact upstream of these defects, responsible for \neach of them occurring? In other words: is there a \n\"master\" change with age, upstream of all (or some) \ndefects that occur with age?  A defect that could \nfulfill the \u201cupstream\u201d role is membrane signaling. \nIn fact, changes in membrane signaling start to \nappear early after cell maturation and worsen \nwith time, they occur in all cells of our organs and \ntissues and influence genomic and non-genomic \nactivities.  Although a widely studied example of \ndefective membrane signalling with age is brain \ninsulin resistance, age is also accompanied by \nresistance to thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), to \ngrowth hormone, orexin, corticosteroid hormones, \nfibroblast growth factor and more. Moreover, \ndefective membrane signalling is also evident \nfor neurotransmitter signalling and G-protein \ncoupled receptors. Therefore, understanding the \nmechanisms underlying the changes in plasma membrane signalling with age could open avenues \nof intervention to reduce the sensory, motor and \ncognitive deficits that occur with age. In my group \nwe have demonstrated that aging produces steady \nchanges in the lipid composition of the neuronal \nplasma membrane, making it a more rigid structure \nin which membrane receptors have reduced \ndynamism, both in their mobility in the plane of \nthe membrane and in their exchange. In turn, we \nshowed that receptors affected by age produce \nweaker signalling when faced with learning and \nmemory stimuli but, at the same time, effectively \nmediate survival responses, suggesting that the \nloss of cognitive abilities that we are experiencing \nwith age is, to put it in some way, a \u201ctoll\u201d to keep \nour neurons alive. The projects that we are \ncurrently developing are aimed at determining the \nmolecular mechanisms behind these changes, both \nphysiological and pathological brain aging. https://www.cbm.uam.es/cdottiGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nCarlos Dotti\nPostdoctoral fellows: \nFrancesc Guix Rafols\nMarta Car\u00fas-Cadavieco\nIn\u00e9s Berenguer L\u00f3pez\nPredoctoral fellows\n\u00c1lvaro Casadom\u00e9 Perales\nRaquel Garc\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez\nTechnicians:\nMercedes Hern\u00e1ndez  \ndel CerroUndergraduate and \nMaster Students:\nDaniel Sierra Albo (2021)  \nDaniel Almansa Amores \n(2021) \nAndrea Gonz\u00e1lez \nCarrascosa (2021) \nAlba Montoro Canelo \n(2021) \nMiguel \u00c1ngel Serrano \nLope  (2022) \nVioleta Enriquez \nZarralanga  (2022)\nVisiting scientists:\nSahba Mobini.

Using \nelectrophysiological, imaging and molecular \ntechniques, we have made important contributions \nto understand how the membrane trafficking \nmachinery of the neuron controls synaptic function \nby shuttling neurotransmitter receptors in and out \nof the synaptic membrane. We are also particularly \ninterested in how these processes are altered in \nhuman pathologies associated to cognitive disorders. \nIndeed, using mouse genetics and behavioral \nassays, we have found that some signaling cascades \ncontrolling this trafficking machinery are defective in \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease and some forms of autism.\nIn recent years, our research is concentrated on \ntwo intersecting directions. On the one hand, we \ncontinue uncovering the molecular components \nand signaling cascades that control the remodeling \nof synapses during plasticity. We are dedicating \nparticular effort to the signaling pathway controlled \nby phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) and the \nsmall GTPase Ras. The PI3K-Ras pathway is crucial \nduring embryonic development, when it controls \ncell proliferation and differentiation. Nevertheless, \nit is also very active in postnatal and adult life. In \nparticular, in the brain, it participates in several \nforms of synaptic plasticity and in this manner \nis thought to contribute to cognitive function. However, the mechanisms that control PI3K activity \nin neurons, and how this activity is relayed into \ndownstream intracellular signaling, such as the Ras-\nmTOR cascade, are far from clear. Indeed, we are \nnow finding that different PI3K and Ras isoforms \ncontribute to specialized functions in neurons and \nglial cells, coupling with different presynaptic and \npostsynaptic components during synaptic plasticity. \nWe are also investigating how these mechanisms \nimpact on cognitive function and behavioral aspects \nsuch as anxiety and sociability.\nOn the other hand, we have investigated how \nenvironmental contaminants shift some of these \nsignaling mechanisms, altering neurodevelopmental \nprograms with long-lasting consequences in \nthe adult life. In particular, using rats as animal \nmodel, we have found that chronic exposure to \nlow concentrations of common pesticides during \nembryonic development and early postnatal life \nchanges the activation of intracellular signaling and \nimpairs synaptic plasticity. We believe these changes \nare responsible for behavioral deficits observed in \nthese animals later in life.\nIn summary, our combined application of in vitro \nand in vivo approaches is allowing us to explore how \nindividual molecules and signaling pathways control \nsynaptic function and determine our cognitive \nabilities in health and disease.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Esteban \nGarc\u00eda\nPostdoctoral \nFellows:  \nV\u00edctor Briz Herrezuelo  \nPredoctoral Fellows:  \nSergio L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda (until \nOctober 2022)\nAlba Fern\u00e1ndez Rodrigo\nEsperanza L\u00f3pez MerinoEneko Merino \nCasamayor  (from \nNovember 2021)\nCelia Garc\u00eda Vilela  (from \nSeptember 2022)\nTechnician:\nSilvia Guti\u00e9rrez Eisman\nUndergraduate:\nJessie Jiang (until June \n2021)\nVittoria Nistic\u00f2 (October \n2021 \u2013 May 2022)\nIzascun Los Arcos  \n(from June 2022)\nwww.cbm.csic.es/estebanlabMECHANISMS OF SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY, AND CONTRIBUTION  \nTO COGNITIVE FUNCTION125\nMolecular Neuropathology Unit\n CBM 2021-2022Analysis of neuronal function of PI3K isoforms.

We \nalso investigate the pathological consequences of \ntheir alterations in lipid storage disorders such as \nNiemann Pick diseases (NPDs). To this aim we use \nmice in which the metabolism of these lipids has been \ngenetically altered allowing in vivo analysis and the \npreclinical assessment of potential therapies. In the \nperiod 2021-2022, our studies unveiled the important \nrole of sphingomyelin and cholesterol in neuronal \nsynaptic plasticity (by influencing the metabotropic \nglutamate receptor 5) and on the regulation of the \nglucocorticoid and endocannabinoid systems. These \nroles link alterations in sphingomyelin and cholesterol \ndistribution and levels to psychiatric conditions, like \nanxiety and depression, which characterize NPDs and \nshow increased incidence with age. Moreover, we have \nobtained evidence supporting sphingomyelin overload \nas a primary cause of myelin alterations by affecting \noligodendrocyte differentiation, which may be an early \npathological event leading to neurodegeneration in \nNPDs. In addition to acquire basic knowledge about the \nrole of lipids in neurons and glial cells our research has \na relevant translational side. Thus, during 2021-2022 \nwe have indentified a specific sphingomyelin species in blood as a potential biomarker for brain pathology \nin NPD type A.

Hyperekplexia \nis a rare sensorimotor disorder provoked by \ndefective glycinergic inhibition that may have \nsevere consequences in neonates. The neuronal \nGlyT2 glycine transporter, which is crucial for the \nrecycling of synaptic neurotransmitter and supplies \nglycine for synaptic vesicle refilling, is nonfunctional \nin the presynaptic form of the disease. One of our \naims is to identify and characterize new mutations \nin the human GlyT2 gene (SLC6A5)  found in \nhyperekplexia patients. After the identification \nand assessment of the pathogenic mechanisms of \nseveral hyperekplexia-associated GlyT2 variants, \nwe have now shown some of them are amenable \nto rescue from its trafficking defect by chemical \nchaperones. This may help developing more specific \npharmacochaperones as candidate therapeutic tools \nfor hyperekplexia with the help of 3D computational \nmodels we have developed. Some other hyperekplexia \nmutations have revealed interesting unknown \naspects on transporter oligomerization we study \nwith refined oligomer modeling. Moreover, we \nhave found new components of GlyT2 interactoma, \nsome of which are candidate hyperekplexia genes \nthat remain to be identified, besides revealing a \nrole in ion homeostasis for GlyT2 and its partners. An additional aspect of our research led us advance \nin the knowledge of the mechanisms of GlyT2 \nregulation. First, we have shown GlyT2 is regulated \nby the Hedgehog pathway in vitro and in vivo . GlyT2 \ncontrol by this signaling cascade, clearly involved \nin development, moved us to investigate a possible \nrole for GlyT2 in the development of glycinergic \nneurotransmission. We have also studied the role \nof transporters in the processing of nociceptive \ninformation by exploring mechanisms of GlyT2 \nregulation by M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, \nthe most clearly involved in pain processing in the \nspinal cord. Finally, we explored modulators of \nGlyT2 activity to obtain information applicable to \nanalgesia. We analyzed the comparative docking of \nthe two selective GlyT2 inhibitors with nanomolar \naffinity and defined their differential interactions \nwith the transporter protein. Structural information \nabout the interactions with GlyT2 may provide \nuseful tools for new drug discovery applicable to \nanalgesia.Group Members\nPrincipal Investigator (PI)\nBeatriz L\u00f3pez Corcuera\nPredoctoral fellows\nRaquel Felipe Mend\u00eda\nJorge Sarmiento Jim\u00e9nez (from September 2021)\nStudents\nAraceli V\u00e1zquez Medel (from September 2022)\nTechnical Assistance\nEnrique N\u00fa\u00f1ez Balbuena (50% dedication)\nPHYSIOPATHOLOGY OF GLYCINE TRANSPORTERS IN GLYCINERGIC \nNEUROTRANSMISSION: HYPEREKPLEXIA AND PAIN\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/blopez129\nMolecular Neuropathology Unit\n CBM 2021-2022Other activities\nThe group belongs to the Institute of Investigaci\u00f3n \nBiosanitaria IdiPAZ from November 2010 as research group \n\u201cImplication of glycinergic and glutamatergic systems in \npathologies of the Central Nervous System\u201d.Immunolocalization of GlyT2 and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine \nreceptors in rat spinal cord.\nParticipation in projects\n \u00bbPID2020-119399RB-I00.

For this, we have had \ncontinuous funding from the Spanish Science and \nHealth Ministries and the European Union, as well \nas from private Foundations and Institutions.\nA key methodological approach for research in our \nlaboratory is the generation and characterization \nof mouse models of disease that truly recapitulate \npathogenesis, as well as neuropathology and \nsymptoms (construct and face validity) and that \noften allow to characterize existing therapies \n(predictive validity) and to assay novel ones.\nAltered RNA processing in the pathogenesis of \nneural disease has been a central theme of research \nin of our laboratory in recent years. More precisely, \nwe have found alteration of specific splicing \nfactors and a role of aberrant alternative splicing \nin HD (Fern\u00e1ndez-Nogales et al. Nat Med 20:881-\n5, 2014; Cabrera JR & Lucas. Brain Pathol. 27:181-\n9, 2017; Hern\u00e1ndez et al. Brain 143:2207-19, 2020) \nand in Alzheimer\u2019s (Garc\u00eda-Escudero et al. Acta \nNeuropathol. 142:159-77, 2021). The relevance of the \nhuman/mouse intersect RNAseq analysis that we \nhave developed and applied to stablish the global mis-splicing signature in HD human postmortem \ntissue (Elorza et al. Brain 144:2009-23, 2021) is \nhighlighted by a recent spotlight review on our study \n(Xing et al. Trends Neurosci 2236:00209-5, 2021). \nWe have also found alteration in microexon splicing \nand regulated polyadenyation of the transcriptome \nin autism (Parras et al. Nature 560:441-6, 2018), in \nepilepsy (Parras et al. Brain 143:2139-53, 2020) as well \nas in HD (Pic\u00f3 S, et al. Sci Transl Med 13:eabe7104, \n2021). The latter led to the discovery of a deficit of \nthiamine transport through brain endothelium in HD \npatients, which originated a clinical trial to explore \nits therapeutic relevance (https://clinicaltrials.gov/\nct2/show/NCT04478734) . \nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nJos\u00e9 J.

Julio 2022.132\nPhysiological and Pathological Processes CBM 2021-2022\nSummary\nThe hippocampus is a brain region that hosts one of \nthe most striking forms of neural plasticity, namely \nthe generation of new neurons throughout life, \nor adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). AHN \nparticipates in hippocampal-dependent learning \nand mood regulation, and it encompasses the birth \nand functional integration of newborn neurons. The \ngeneration of new neurons is compromised during \nphysiological aging and under neurodegenerative \nconditions in rodents. Our group demonstrated \nthat AHN persists during physiological aging until \nthe tenth decade of human life (Terreros-Roncal \net al., Science 2021). Moreover, we showed that \nAHN is critically impaired in patients with distinct \nneurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u00b4 s \ndisease (Moreno-Jim\u00e9nez et al., Nature Medicine, \n2019), ALS, Huntington\u00b4s disease, Parkinson\u00b4s \ndisease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and \nFrontotemporal dementia (Terreros-Roncal et al., \nScience, 2021). Progress in the field of human AHN \nhas been hindered by technical limitations related \nto the quality of available human brain samples. In \nthis regard, our group overcame these technical \ndifficulties and demonstrated that specific tissue \nprocessing methodologies are necessary to observe \nthe presence of new neurons in the adult human \nhippocampus (Flor-Garc\u00eda et al., Nature Protocols, \n2020).Supported by the recent award of the ERC \nConsolidator Grant \u201cERC-CoG-2020-101001916-\nHum AN\u201d, our research group seeks to investigate \nthe basic biology of neural stem cells (the cell \npopulation that gives rise to new neurons in the \nadult mammalian hippocampus) as well as the \nmechanisms that control the modulation of adult \nhippocampal neurogenesis under physiological \nand pathological conditions in humans. We also \nperform in vivo and in vitro  studies on animal \nmodels of different diseases. In particular, we are \ninterested in determining the therapeutic potential \nof increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis for \nthe treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric \ndiseases. Importantly, in most of these disorders, \nthe hippocampus is one of the most affected \nareas. Therefore, other research lines of our lab \nare focused on developing strategies capable of \nincreasing the functionality of newborn neurons. \nFor that purpose, we use novel viral tools and \ndistinct non-pharmacological approaches aimed at \nincreasing hippocampal plasticity.https://www.cbm.uam.es/llorenslabGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nMar\u00eda Llorens-Mart\u00edn\nPostdoctoral Fellows: \nBerenice M\u00e1rquez Valadez\nJulia Terreros-Roncal (From \nNov 10, 2022)\nPredoctoral Fellows:\nJulia Terreros-Roncal (Until \nNov 9, 2022)\nElena Moreno Jim\u00e9nez\nMiguel De La Flor Garc\u00eda\nMarta Gallardo Caballero \n(From Feb 16, 2022)\nAna Victoria Pr\u00e1danos \nSen\u00e9n (From Oct 1st, 2022)Technicians:\nCarla Rodr\u00edguez Moreno\nUndergraduate And \nMaster Students: \nEvgenia Kokosali   \n(From Dec 1st, 2022)\nJavier Molina Hern\u00e1ndez \n(From Sept 1st, 2022;  \nCo-Supervised With.

Many neurological diseases, \nlike PD, are the result of cell death or degeneration. \nThe exponentially growing impairment/death rate \nof dopaminergic neurons (DAn) in the midbrain\u2019s \nsubstantia nigra (the A9 subgroup) in PD limits the \ntherapeutic window of the treatments available that \nare known to increase the quality of life of patients \nalthough none can prevent the progression of PD.\nConsequently, repairing damaged tissue becomes \nthe goal; when cell loss cannot be prevented, \ncell replacement holds the key to recovery.  Cell \nreplacement therapy for PD is based on the concept \nthat DAn implanted ectopically may functionally \nrestore and maintain the DA levels lost in the disease. \nClinical research using human fresh fetal ventral \nmesencephalic (VM) tissue (hfVM, containing some \nDAn precursors and many other cell types) provided \nproof of principle of the therapeutic efficacy of \ndopaminergic transplants on a long-term basis. \nHowever, limitations in hfVM supply, along with the \nvariability of results of different clinical trials and the \nappearance of graft-induced dyskinesias in some \npatients, have precluded the implantation of tissue \ntransplantation as a clinical therapy. In this context, \nresearch on the basic biology of human stem cells acquires special relevance. Our research group is \ninterested in the basic biology of stem cells and \nthe developmental events leading to maturation \nof neuronal derivatives of use in the study of the \nhuman brain and the development of novel cell-\nbased therapies for neurodegenerative diseases \n(e.g. Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s disease).\nWe have studied the trophic actions of human \nneural and mesenchymal stem cells in experimental \nin vivo models of PD focusing on the parallelism \nbetween pathological changes occurring in the \nbrain vs neurological and motor alterations. \nWith a multidisdisciplinary approach, we have \nworked in the development of the technology for \nexternally controllable bioimplants of therapeutic \ncells on-demand. These bioimplants consisting \nin multifunctional leaky optoelectrical fiber for \npotential neuromodulation and as a cell substrate \nfor application in combined optogenetic stem cell \ntherapy.\nWith the aim of minimizing the number of laboratory \nanimals used for basic research while increasing the \nbody of knowledge on the biology human neural \ntissue we have developed a research line devoted \nto the generation of human cerebral organoids \nwith improved features facilitating patterning \nstudies and useful for improving current preclinical \nresearch testing.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nMarta P.

Impairing the balance \nbetween SC self-renewal and differentiation paves \nthe way to either tissue functional and structural \nimpairment and may lead to tumorigenesis. SC \nhave been found in the mammalian central nervous \nsystem, where they contribute to the homeostatic \nbalance by addition of new neurons and glial cells \nto the brain once development has concluded. \nWithin specialized niches, the microenvironments \nwhere they dwell, neural stem cells (NSC), derived \nprogenitors and differentiated progeny are stratified \nwithin a highly regulated hierarchy and coordinated \nto maintain the necessary cellular production to \nuphold adult tissue renewal. Notwithstanding NSC \ncontribution to homeostasis, their regenerative \ncapacity is limited and unable to replace lost neural \npopulations to induce a real functional recovery in \nsituations of brain damage. However, since they can \nactivate in reaction to some types of lesions, the \npopulation of NSC is regarded as a potential cellular \ntarget for regenerative medicine. In our group, we focus on the molecular \ncharacterization of the pathways involved in \nmammalian NSC self-renewal and differentiation \nto neuronal and glial populations. To this end, we \nuse tissue specific conditional and inducible loss- \nand gain-of-function mouse models. We are mostly \ninterested in pinpointing molecular targets to \neffectively manipulate these processes on demand. \nThis strategy holds the potential for exploiting NSC \nand their progeny for replacement/regenerative \ntherapeutic interventions, in physiological ageing \nor pathological situations stemmed from \nneurodegeneration or demyelination.\nPolo like kinase 1 (PLK1) is an essential gene coding \na druggable serine/threonine kinase with crucial \nroles. Although the canonical functions of PLK1 \nare related to cell proliferation, as to drive mitotic \ncell cycle and serving to establish a functional \nbipolar spindle during mitosis, unexpected mitosis-\nindependent roles are emerging. In this regard, \nwe have contributed to describing the role of Plk1 \nin the control of cell fate during embryonic neural \nprogenitor division (Gonzalez-Martinez, et al., 2022), \nand we have established that Plk1 is a key player in \nadult NSC self-renewal and neuronal differentiation \n(Barrios-Mu\u00f1oz, PhD Thesis, 2021).

Family studies \nhave established a strong genetic contribution \nto psychiatric diseases, but the specific genes \ninvolved still remain largely unknown. Psychiatric \ndisorders are caused by a combination of common \nvariants, each with a small effect, and multiple \nrare variants of higher penetrance. Our aim is \nto identify susceptibility genes implicated in \nautism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder \n(BD), and schizophrenia. In our lab we perform \ngenomic approaches applied to psychiatry via next-\ngeneration sequencing (whole-exome sequencing, \nwhole-genome sequencing, total RNA-sequencing), \nthe examination of copy number variants, and the \ninvestigation of common variants through case-\ncontrol and family-based association studies. \nIn the last years, we adopted a combination of \ngenomic approaches using one of the largest cohort \nof families with multiple members affected by \nbipolar disorder. In these studies, we employed: 1) \nA novel powerful genomic approach by combining \nlinkage analysis with exome sequencing showing \nthat this method is effective for gene discovery. We \nperformed a non-parametric linkage analysis and \nfound a linkage peak (LOD score>3) on chromosome \n10q11-q21, which is explained by rare pathogenic \ncoding variants, including those from the BD-\nassociated ANK3 gene; 2) A combination of both transcriptomic and whole-genome sequencing \nin multiplex bipolar families, pinpointing novel \nputative susceptibility genes and pathways with \nbiological significance for the disorder. \nRecently, we established a novel Spanish node for \npsychiatric genetics and founded the Madrid Manic \nGroup (MadManic) that brings together geneticists, \nbioinformaticians, clinicians, and psychiatrists \naiming to develop novel translational tools applied \nin clinical practise combining genetic risk from \ngenomic arrays, digital records from ecological \nmomentary assessment (EMA) and machine \nlearning approaches. Currently, we established one \nof the largest cohort of BD patients and controls in \nSpain with several biospecimens (DNA, RNA, and \nplasma). We created an electronic clinical protocol \nfor recording in a unique platform (MeMind) clinical \nhistory of patients, response to medications, and \nbehavioural scales. These instruments are allowing \nthe contribution of our group to global consortia \nefforts for gene discovery, pharmacogenomics and \nclinical presentations for BD research. Recently, \nwe participated in the largest genomic study in BD \nthrough a genome-wide association study (GWAS) \nmeta-analysis of 57 cohorts (41,000 cases and \n371,549 controls) (Figure 1), which identified 64 loci \nimplicated in the disorder.Group Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nDr Claudio Toma \nPhD students:\nMiriam Mart\u00ednez Jim\u00e9nez\nIn\u00e9s Garcia OrtizUndergraduate and \nMaster Students: \nJos\u00e9 Ignacio G\u00f3mez \nBlanco (co-supervisor \nSerrano E)\nNerea Regueira Acebedo \n(until June 2021)\nTechnicians:\nSergio Espartero Boza\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/claudio.tomaTHE GENETICS OF PSYCHIATRIC DISEASES139\nMolecular Neuropathology Unit\n CBM 2021-2022From Mullins et al., 2021 Nature Genetics.

We have focused \non a signalling pathway modified in the three \npathologies, PI3K-Akt-mTORC1.\nWe are analysing the role of the mTORC1 element \nas a central regulator of catabolism and anabolism. \nRegarding Alzheimer's disease, we have verified \nthat mTORC1 inhibition has a therapeutic effect \nboth in vivo and ex vivo (in primary cultures of \nneurons and glia) in a transgenic mouse model of \nAD. This inhibition produces a certain activation of \nautophagy that leads to a reduction in the amyloid \nload both in transgenic mice and in neurons and glia \nfrom these mice. At this time our work is focused \non the analysis of how the different autophagy \nregulators can modify the generation/secretion of \namyloid in this transgenic model.\nSecond, we focus on glioblastomas, age-related \ntumours, and recently published that some Akt-\nregulated elements (such as WIP and YAP/TAZ) are \nresponsible for cell division of cancer stem cells and \nmaintenance of their tumour phenotype. Our work now focuses on astrocyte-astrocytoma-\nglioma conversion trying to define the role of WIP \nas a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton and glioma \nproliferation. We have characterized by RNA-seq \nthe differential expression corresponding to the \nelimination of WIP, YAP or TAZ in gliomas and we \ntry to identify and study the elements regulated \nby them that control proliferation and the tumour \nphenotype in glioma.\nOur project on Ischemia has been transferred to \nDr. M\u00aa Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez, who was the main responsible \nof this issue in our group, and who has become PI \nand project manager.

Communication between neurons implies \nan interplay between excitatory pathways mediated \nby glutamate and inhibitory neurotransmission \nmediated by GABA and glycine. The modulating \naction of less abundant neurotransmitters, such as \ndopamine, is added on top of these major pathways. \nThis neurotransmitter crosstalk is controlled by a \nseries of membrane proteins including ion channels, \nreceptors and transporters. Alterations in these \nproteins are associated with diseases such as stroke, \nepilepsy or schizophrenia. Our objectives include \nthe study of the interactions between some of these \nproteins and their environment, represented by the \ninteractome and the lipidome. By using proximity \nlabeling proteomic techniques we have been able to \nfind new proteins and lipids that control the activity \nof the dopamine transporter. On the other hand, \nwe have been able to find new interactions with the \nAKT1 signaling pathway with the sodium ion channel \n(NaV1.1), which controls the activity of GABAergic \nneurons and whose alteration is associated with a \nform of severe epilepsy called Dravet syndrome. \nWe have also investigated regulatory mechanisms \nof glycine transporters, which participate in the \ntransmission of pain in the spinal cord and of \nsensory information in the retina. In a model of neuropathic pain, we have obtained evidence \nindicating a readjustment of the levels of the \nglycinergic marker GlyT2 in response to microglia \nactivation. In the retina, we have described a new \nregulatory mechanism by microRNAs that adjusts \nthe levels of the GlyT1 to the intensity of light.\nDuring this time, we have maintained collaborations \nwith the groups of Dr. F.J. D\u00edez-Guerra, Drs. B. L\u00f3pez-\nCorcuera (CBMSO) and C. Avenda\u00f1o (UAM) on the role \nof glycinergic pathways; Drs. A. Rodr\u00edguez Artalejo \n(UCM) and D. Bartolom\u00e9-Mart\u00edn (la Laguna) in the \nstudy of the activity of the sodium and potassium \nchannels. We have also collaborated with clinicians \nof the Sant Joan de D\u00e9u Hospital in Barcelona (Dr. J. \nArmstrong), the San Sebasti\u00e1n University Hospital \n(Dr. I. Mart\u00ed-Carrera) and the University Hospital of \nMostoles (Dr. A. D\u00edaz de Bustamante) with whom \nwe have participated in the investigation of the \npathogenic mechanisms underlying a form of \nepilepsy due to mutations in the GABA transporter. \nIn summary, our work deepens our understanding \nof the mechanisms of communication in the brain \nunder physiological and pathological conditions.Group Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nFrancisco Zafra\nPredoctoral fellows: \nDolores Piniella\nTechnicians: \nEnrique N\u00fa\u00f1ez\nMaster and undergraduate students:\nAnia Canseco Rodr\u00edguez\nAlejandro Maestre Guill\u00e9n.MOLECULAR BASIS OF NEUROTRANSMISSION  \nAND ITS IMPLICATION IN NEUROPATHOLOGY\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/fzafra143\nMolecular Neuropathology Unit\n CBM 2021-2022The dopamine transporter (Ch-DAT) and phosphoinositide phosphatase SHIP2 (in green) show extensive colocalization when co-\nexpressed in neurons\nParticipation in projects\n \u00bb2019-2021. \u201cPapel de los microRNAs y los exosomas en \nla inducci\u00f3n de la tolerancia isqu\u00e9mica en el cerebro\u201d. \nMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00f3n RTI2018-098712-B-I00. \nPI: Francisco Zafra.List of publications\n \u00bbMartinez-Lozada, Z., Hewett, S.J., Zafra, F. and Ortega, \nA.

Once considered to be mere sites of ATP \ngeneration, it is now evident that these organelles \nparticipate in a wide range of cellular processes \nincluding calcium homeostasis, apoptosis, redox \nbalance or cell fate. Because of this multifaceted \ncontribution of mitochondria to key biologic \nand metabolic pathways it is not surprising that \nmitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to many \nhuman disorders including neurodegeneration, \ndiabetes, cancer or aging.\nSpecifically, our lab focuses on defects in the \noxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) \noccurring from mitochondrial disease mutations \nthat compromise cellular fitness and survival. \nThis biochemical failure is thought to underlie \npathologies associated with mitochondrial \ndysfunction. However, the precise metabolic \nprocesses, signaling pathways and compensatory responses resulting from a defective \nmitochondrial Electron Transport Chain (ETC) \nthat drive these fatal disorders are not entirely \nunderstood. Although diminished ATP production \nhas been considered a hallmark of mitochondrial \ndysfunction, our recent discoveries highlighted \nthat other metabolic failures such as disturbed \nredox hemostasis due to accumulated levels of \nNADH can be equally detrimental. Moreover, \nwhich cell types contribute the most to the disease \nand whether disease-carrying cells negatively \nimpact the function of its surrounding wild-\ntype neighbors or distant organs remain poorly \ncharacterized. \nThe long-tern goal of our lab is to understand the \nmolecular components that regulate mitochondrial \nmetabolism, in the context of physiology and \ndiseases, and use this knowledge to develop \nsuccessful therapies.

Those are \ncovalent conjugates of an oligosaccharide to certain \namino acid residues on the protein backbone, \nresulting in a plethora of glycoforms potentially \nexhibiting a wide spectrum of functional and \nbiological proteins for a single gene product. Almost \nall secreted and membrane proteins are glycosylated \nand hence almost all plasma and serum proteins are \nglycoproteins. This co-translational modification \nwidens the functional spectra of proteins at least \none magnitude order. Glycan biosynthesis is more \nsignificantly affected by disease states than by \nprotein production. Glycomics, therefore holds \nconsiderable promise specifically as disease \nmarkers. The nonlinear and non-template based \nbiosynthesis of glycans make head to head compare \nglycomics to proteomics is not technically possible, \nand complex structural analysis of glycome is \nnecessary in order to get a glycomic profile. \nThe group has devoted the last five years to assemble, \nimplement and validate a novel technological \nplatform that allows us to analyze the N-glycome \nfrom minute amounts of biological samples: sera, \nplasma or tissues, unique at the UAM campus \nand second in Spain, and fourth in Europe behind Croatia and Ireland. The group has curated one of \nthe largest collections of clinically well characterized \nbiological samples of American tripanosomiasis \nbiological samples (around 5000), leishmaniasis \nvisceral and Neurocisticercosis from all stages of \nthe diseases, before and after chemotherapeutic \ntreatment.\nThe glycomic evaluation of individuals (not \npopulations) allows to establish associations to \ndisease progression, therapeutic efficacy or failure \nand reinfections. The system has been used to \nanalyze samples form three defined infectious \ndisease from which we have clinically defined \ncohorts (Chagas disease, Leishmaniasis  and \nNeurocysticercosis). From our previous studies on \ntyiortal sera N-glycome we have moved to study \nthe effector profile of human Immunoglobiulin G \nderived from its glycosylation profile. By using this \nnovel approach, we have been allowed to identify \nsome molecular markers for efficacy during the \ntreatment with Benznidazole for acute Chagas \ndisease patients, and able to discriminate the latent \nform active form of neurocysticercosis, previously \nonly possible by using classical image systems like \nNMR or PET-TAC.\nFUNCTIONAL GLYCOGENOMICS\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/pbonay Group Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nPedro Bonay Miarons\nUndergraduate and Master Students:\nRaquel Lorenzo Marco\nMaria del Rosario Luaces Serrano\nSilvia Novo Acevedo\nAntonio Perez Gonzalesz149\nMetabolic and Signaling Networks in Disease Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nDiscriminant analysis derived from 24 structural glycan traits (Fig. 1) showing the clear resolution between Control healthy subjects \n(blue dots) and the different stages of Cardiac symptomatic stages patients from American trypanosomiasis.\nOther activities\nThe PI has been awarded one more year as the \nnational representative from Spain at the International \nGlycoconjugate Organization (IGO, associated to IUB-MB \nsince 1989) and The Societyy of Glycobiology The roles inside \nthe IGO  and now at the SG, are to further international \ncollaboration for the study of glycoconjugates, survey the \nacademic activities on Glycosciences around the globe and \nto define the roadmap to integrate the glycosciences as a \nsignificant part of the science curriculum in the high-school, \nundergraduate and graduate education.150\nPhysiological and Pathological Processes CBM 2021-2022\nSummary\nMitochondria are an important source of reactive \noxygen species (ROS) in mammalian cells. The \nproduction of ROS by mitochondria underlies \noxidative damage in many pathologies and \ncontributes to redox signaling. Research in our \nlab is focused on the role of mitochondria and \nmitochondria-derived ROS in cell physiology and \nin the development of pathological conditions. \nIn particular, we are interested in myocardial \nischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, which contributes \nto adverse cardiovascular outcomes after \nmyocardial ischemia, cardiac surgery or circulatory \narrest. During myocardial infarction, the lack of \noxygen and nutrients induces ischemic injury. \nThe most effective treatment to limit infarct size \nis early reperfusion. Reperfusion injury consist \nof the paradoxical exacerbation of cellular \ndamage following restoration of blood flow to \npreviously ischemic tissues. Myocardial IR injury \nis mediated by several factors including excessive \nROS production, which are generated mainly at \nreperfusion. The combined effects of ROS and \nelevated calcium concentration lead to the opening \nof the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, \nwhich plays a critical role in reperfusion injury.\nOur recent studies have focused on the protective \nrole of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP3 \nin cardiac IR injury. UCP3 is involved in the control \nof the production of mitochondrial ROS and in the protection against oxidative damage. We have \nfound that hearts from mice lacking UCP3 subjected \nto IR have larger infarct size than those from wild-\ntype mice. However, suppression of superoxide \nproduction in UCP3 deficient hearts decreases infarct \nsize. UCP3 deficiency affects cardiac metabolism \nafter IR, particularly fatty acid oxidation. Myocardial \nIR adversely affects mitochondrial ultrastructure, \nreduces the number of inter-mitochondrial junctions \nand increases the accumulation of lipid droplets, \neffects that are more evident in hearts lacking UCP3.\nThe transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid \n2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a critical regulator of the \ncellular stress response. In response to different \nactivation stimuli, Nrf2 translocates from the \ncytoplasm to the nucleus, where it activates the \ntranscription of its downstream targets by binding \nto the antioxidant response element (ARE) or the \nelectrophile response element (EpRE). Nrf2 is believed \nto control de basal and inducible expression of a large \nnumber of genes involved in antioxidant defense, \ndetoxification, inflammatory response, proteasomal \nand autophagic degradation, and metabolism, \nreflecting its multiple cellular functions. We are \ncurrently studying the cardioprotective role of Nrf2 \nin myocardial IR injury and its possible involvement \nin ischemic preconditioning. These studies have \npotential clinical value as they might help develop \ntherapeutic strategies for cardioprotection.\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/scadenasGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nSusana Cadenas \u00c1lvarez    \nPredoctoral fellow\nAna Mata Villanueva \nUndergraduate students     \nSara Natalia Jaroszewicz (September 2021-June 2022)  MITOCHONDRIAL PATHOPHYSIOLOGY151\nMetabolic and Signaling Networks in Disease Unit\n CBM 2021-2022List of publications\n \u00bbCadenas S.

Indeed, mitochondria are the central hub \nof metabolism and targets of sexual hormones, \nwith a suggested role in modulating sex-specific \ndifferences in many physio-pathological conditions.\nWe are currently running two projects: one \nconsidering metabolism and one cardiovascular \ndisease. \nSince metabolism shows considerable differences \nbetween the two sexes, we are exploring the \nhypothesis that mitochondrial functions can be \ndifferently modulated in males and females and \ntherefore determine important physiological \ndifferences. \nTo prove this, we are performing a wide analysis of \nmitochondrial functions and morphology, together \nwith gene expression analysis and metabolomics \napproach (in collaboration with Christian Frezza\u2019s \nlaboratory, CECAD, Cologne). Our target tissues are \nthe liver, muscle, and white adipose tissue of males \nand females mice, further clustered according to \nthe estrous phase. In parallel, to be able to study the role of sex \nsteroids and different growth conditions on \nmitochondrial functions in vitro, we are generating \ntwo fibroblast cell lines from female and male mice \nthat constitutively over-express the estrogen and \nandrogen receptors.\nCardiovascular disease is the first death cause \nin women worldwide. Nowadays, we know that \nbiological sex has a strong impact on cardiovascular \nperformance however the molecular mechanisms \nare still unknown. In our lab, we aim to understand \nthe mitochondrial role in the development of heart \nfailure, a pathological condition that presents \nimportant clinical sex differences. Applying a \nbiochemistry approach, electronic microscopy, \nand gene expression analysis, we are mapping \nthe mitochondrial differences between male and \nfemale mice during the progression of heart failure. \nThe ultimate goal is to identify some mitochondrial \npathways that could be potential therapeutic targets \nfor heart failure. Our preliminary data suggest that \nafter transaortic constriction, fertile female mice \nare protected from cardiac hypertrophy and this \ncorrelates with less fibrosis and the maintenance \nof the mitochondrial network analyzed by electron \nmicroscopy.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nSara Cogliati\nScientific Staff: \nAsier Collado, Research \nassistant, Programa Yo \nInvestigo  (from October \n2022)\nPredoctoral fellows: \nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Consuegra \nMart\u00ednez (from September \n2022)Technicians: \nAna Sagrera Aparisi (from \nJanuary 2021)\nUndergraduate and \nMaster Students : \nLuc\u00eda Gonzalez \nColmenarejo TFG \n(February- June 2022)\nJos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Consuegra \nMart\u00ednez TFM  (February- \nJune 2022)\nStefano Vecchione, \nErasmus Student TFM \n(from October 2022)MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF SEX-DIFFERENCES IN METABOLISM \nPHYSIOLOGY AND DISEASE\nwww.cbm.uam.es/scogliati153\nMetabolic and Signaling Networks in Disease Unit\n CBM 2021-2022List of publications\n \u00bbCogliati S, Cabrera-Alarc\u00f3n JL and Enriquez JA (2021). \nRegulation and functional role of the electron transport \nchain supercomplexes.

Consistent with its prime \nphysiological roles mitochondrial dysfunction is \ninvolved in the genesis and progression of ageing \nand of a plethora of human pathologies including \ncancer, metabolic syndrome, neurodegeneration \nand rare disorders. The mitochondrial ATP synthase is \na key transducer in energy conservation by oxidative \nphosphorylation (OXPHOS), in the execution of \ncell death and in intracellular signaling by calcium \nand reactive oxygen species (ROS). Previously, we \ndocumented the mechanisms and role-played by \nthe ATP synthase in metabolic reprogramming \nduring liver development and in human carcinomas. \nMore recently, we demonstrated that the inhibitor \nof the ATP synthase, named ATPase Inhibitory \nFactor 1 (IF1), is highly overexpressed in carcinomas \nplaying a pivotal role in metabolic reprogramming \nof cancer and stem cells. We showed that binding of \nIF1 to the ATP synthase inhibits the enzyme under \nnormal physiological conditions and this binding is \nprevented by phosphorylation of IF1-S39 through \nthe activity of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A \nlike activity. Inhibition of the ATP synthase is required \nfor adaptation to hypoxia, cell cycle progression and \nin cancer. Contrariwise, dephosphorylation of IF1 \nis required to increase the mitochondrial output of \nATP in response to an increase in energy demand. Moreover, the IF1-mediated inhibition of the ATP \nsynthase triggers a ROS signal that promotes the \nactivation of nuclear programs of proliferation and \nresistance to cell death. Hence, IF1 is a most relevant \nmitochondrial protein that participates in defining \nthe cellular phenotype. \nA main objective of our group is to deepen into the \ncellular biology and role of the ATP synthase/IF1 axis \nin cancer and other metabolic disorders, neuronal \nand immune functions and in ageing. To cover \nthese aims, we have developed transgenic mice \n(Tg-IF1) that conditionally overexpress human IF1 \nin neurons, liver, colon, heart and skeletal muscle, \nand generated the ATP5IF1 lox/lox mouse which has \nbeen successfully used to knock-out IF1 (IF1-KO) in \nneurons, enterocytes and immune cells. With these \nmodels, we have demonstrated in vivo the role of the \nATP synthase/IF1 in metabolic reprogramming and \nin signaling adaptive cellular and tissue responses \nin normal and pathophysiological situations (Fig. 1). \nMoreover, we have developed (i) the PROTEOmAb \nPlatform for the identification of metabolic proteins \nas biomarkers of disease and (ii) identified FDA-\napproved small molecules that regulate OXPHOS \nfor targeting mitochondria and effective bedside \ntranslation of the drugs to patients affected by \nmitochondrial dysfunction. \nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nJos\u00e9 M.

Complex \nregulatory mechanisms enable mitochondrial \nmetabolism to match cell demands, which extend \nbeyond the production of ATP: during the last decade \nwe demonstrated that mitochondrial oxidative \nphosphorylation (OXPHOS) plays further roles in \ncontrolling cell death ( EMBO  J, 2014, 33(7):762-78); \nimmunity ( Cell Reports , 2017, 19(6):1202-1213) and \noncogenesis ( Mol Cell , 2012, 45(6):731-42; Nat Comm , \n2020, 11:3606). Impaired mitochondrial function \nalso deeply alters lipid species and metabolism \n(Diabetologia , 2017, 60(10):2052-2065; EMBO J.  2020, \ne103812) and is emerging as a pivotal hallmark \nof metabolic disorders. Understanding which \nproducts of metabolism are limiting for correct cell \nfunction, and how cells obtain or transform them \nin physiological tissue environments, is crucial to \nexploit mitochondrial metabolism for therapy. \nThe main achievement of our research over the \nlast two years was to deepen our knowledge of \nmitochondrial metabolism in the pathophysiology \nof skeletal muscle, the highest oxidative tissue in \nmammals. We defined how chronic mitochondrial \ndysfunctions drive the formation of muscular \ntubular aggregates (TA), honeycomb-like arrays of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) tubules that induce \nsevere sarcomere disorganization and muscular \npain. TA develops in the skeletal muscle of \npatients with Tubular Aggregate Myopathy (TAM, \nORPHA:2593; OMIM:160565, 615883) as well as in \nother disorders, including endocrine syndromes, \ndiabetes, and aging, although their primary \ncause is unknown. We investigated the molecular \nmechanisms of TA onset and a potential therapy \nin a preclinical mouse model of the disease. We \nshowed that upon chronic in vivo inhibition of the \nmitochondrial ATP synthase, oxidative soleus muscle \nexperiments a metabolic and structural switch \ntowards glycolytic fibers, increases mitochondrial \nfission, and activates mitophagy to recycle damaged \nmitochondria. TA results from the over-response of \nthe fission controller DRP1, which upregulates the \nStore-Operate-Calcium-Entry and increases the \nmitochondria-SR interaction in a futile attempt to \nbuffer calcium overloads upon prolonged OXPHOS \ninhibition. Accordingly, hypoxic muscles cultured \nex vivo show an increase in mitochondria/SR contact \nsites and autophagic/mitophagic zones, where TA \nclusters grow around defective mitochondria. \nMoreover, hypoxia triggered a stronger TA \nformation upon ATP synthase inhibition, and this \neffect was reduced by the DRP1 inhibitor mDIVI.https://www.cbm.uam.es/lformentiniGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nLaura Formentini\nPredoctoral fellows:\nCristina S\u00e1nchez Gonz\u00e1lez, PhD student (until February \n2022)\nJuan Cruz Herrero Mart\u00edn, PhD student (until July 2022)\nBe\u00f1at Salegi Ansa, PhD student (starting January 2022)\nStudents:\nFrancisco Javier Arenas Cerro, TFM student (starting \nDecember 2022)ROLE OF MITOCHONDRIAL METABOLISM  \nON THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF SKELETAL MUSCLE157\nMetabolic and Signaling Networks in Disease Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nSeveral approximations to define mitochondrial dysfunction in LowOXPHOS mice: A) soleus muscle dimension in wt and LowOXPHOS \nanimals.

These cells \nsynthesize extracellular matrix components, such \nas collagen, that ultimately replace the cellular \nliving tissue and establish fibrosis. While major \nadvances regarding the mechanistic knowledge on \nthe underlying cell biology alterations in fibrosis \nhave helped to characterize the main phases and \nmediators involved, this knowledge has not yielded \nsignificant progress in treatment. This is due in \npart to a very incomplete understanding of the \ncellular types involved in the fibrotic response, the \nmetabolic features associated to each of them, \ntheir mutual influence and the changes ultimately \nrelated to the metabolic shift or reprogramming \noccurring in the transition from physiological to \npathological conditions. Metabolic derangement is \nnow identified as a key culprit in the pathophysiology \nof fibrogenesis. During the past years we have studied the role of \nmetabolism in the genesis of renal injury and repair \nfocusing on: a) the importance of fatty acid oxidation \nand b) the crosstalk between fibrosis and circadian \nregulation. To this end we use animal models \nwith specific gain-of-function for critical enzymes \ninvolved in fatty acid oxidation, such as CPT1a, as well \nas animals with a disruption of the circadian rhythm. \nThese studies are complemented by cellular models \nand biochemical approaches directed towards the \nstudy of mitochondrial biogenesis and function. \nWe have found that overexpression of the enzyme \nCpt1a in kidney tubules promotes enhanced fatty \nacid oxidation, restores mitochondrial homeostasis \nand protects from fibrosis.  By dissecting the role \nof specific components of the circadian clock \nthrough the employment of genetically modified \nmouse models, we have investigated the cross-\nregulation between the circadian rhythm and \nkidney inflammation and fibrosis, with a particular \nemphasis on the metabolic component. We have \ncomplemented this approach by evaluating the \nimpact of circadian-related metabolically healthy \ndiets, such as time restriction feeding, on kidney \nfibrosis and function.\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/lamaslabGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nSantiago Lamas Pel\u00e1ez\nPostdoctoral fellows:\nVer\u00f3nica Miguel Herranz \n(until July 2021)\nCarlos Rey Serra\nPredoctoral Fellow:\nBel\u00e9n Sirera Conca\nTechnicians:\nJessica Paola Titua\u00f1a \nFajardo \nJos\u00e9 Ignacio Herrero \nLahuerta (until January \n2022)\n Undergraduate and \nMaster Students:\nIrene Ranz Fern\u00e1ndez. \n09/2020- 06/2021 , final \ndegree project (co-\nsupervisor Ver\u00f3nica Miguel \nHerranz)\nLaura Fern\u00e1ndez \nHern\u00e1ndez. 09/2020- \n06/2021, final degree project \n(co-supervisor Ver\u00f3nica \nMiguel Herranz)\nMar\u00eda Madej\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez. \n(09/2022-), final degree \nproject, (co-supervisor \nCarlos Rey Serra)MOLECULAR PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF FIBROSIS159\nMetabolic and Signaling Networks in Disease Unit\n CBM 2021-2022Other activities\n \u00bbCoordination of the NOVELREN-CM consortium of the \nBiomedicine programme from the Comunidad de Madrid \nfor the study on chronic renal failure. 2018-2022.\n \u00bbGroup leader in the research network RedinRen, RETICS \nprogramme, Instituto de Salud Carlos III. 2020-2022\n \u00bbCollaboration with M2R laboratories for the establishment \nof an experimental model of acute respiratory distress \nsyndrome.Awards\n \u00bb2021: Doctor Honoris Causa, Facultad de Medicina, \nUniversidad de la Rep\u00fablica, Uruguay\n \u00bb2022: Basic Research Award, Society for Free Radical \nResearch-EuropeList of publications\n \u00bbMiguel V, Titua\u00f1a J, Herrero JI, Herrero L, Serra D, Cuevas \nP, Barbas C, Rodr\u00edguez-Puyol D, M\u00e1rquez-Exposito L, \nRuiz-Ortega M, Castillo C, Sheng X, Susztak K, Ruiz-\nCanela M, Salas-Salvad\u00f3 J, Hu FB, Mart\u00ednez Gonzalez MA, \nOrtega S, Ramos R and Lamas S.

G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) acts as \na relevant node by modulating signaling mediated by many \nGPCRs and via phosphorylation or scaffolding interactions \nwith a growing array of cellular partners. We have pioneered \nthe research on such complex \u201cinteractome\u201d and on the \nmechanisms regulating GRK2 levels and functionality. In \nobesity and insulin resistance-related contexts, we have \ndescribed that age and sex-related factors modulate \nmaladaptive changes in cardiac GRK2 levels and tissue-\nspecific roles of GRK2 in the modulation of metabolic \nhomeostasis. In collaboration with P.Penela and C.Ribas, we \nhave shown that GRK2 acts as an oncomodulator in breast \ncancer and in stratified epithelial tumors, by interacting \nwith networks related to the hallmarks of cancer in a cell \ntype-dependent manner, and that the GRK2 interactor \nG\u03b1q regulates the autophagic machinery upon nutrient \nfluctuations. \nComplex intercommunication among cell types from \ndifferent tissues and with the cells of the immune system is \nessential for cellular and organismal homeostasis. We aim \nto elucidate how cell type-specific GRK2 interactomes are \ninvolved in cell-cell communication in defined physiological \nand pathological conditions. We will use cellular and animal models with altered GRK2 levels or functionality in specific \ncell types to study:\n-Maladaptive reshaping of metabolic and inflammatory \nnetworks in different tissues in physio-pathological \nsituations related to aging, obesity, insulin resistance and \ncardiovascular alterations, with emphasis on the role of \nGRK2 in myeloid (neutrophils and macrophages) and other \nimmune cells in inter-organ crosstalk (objectives led by C. \nMurga, I. Garc\u00eda-Higuera and N. Reglero-Real).\n- Autophagy, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. \nN.Reglero-Real and C. Ribas will collaborate in elucidating \nthe modulation of these processes by Gq and other signalling \nnetworks. \n- Crosstalk of signaling cascades within the tumor microen -\nvironment. Connections among tumor microenvironment \nstresses, chemokine and growth factor receptors and GRK2 \ninteractors (HDAC6, HuR, Mdm2, Lyn) in the rewiring of breast \ncancer cell phospho-proteome, acetylome and ubiquitome \nleading to metastatic features (in collaboration with P. Penela \nand the Oncornet 2.0 consortium). \n- Epidermal homeostasis and keratinocyte-immune cells \ncrosstalk.

Moreover, lifestyle factors also affect the \nincidence of cancer and the efficacy of treatments. \nTherefore, it is urgent to find out the mechanisms \ninvolved and the molecular dependencies of tumours \nfor better tackling with cancer treatments.  Even \nthough oncogenes and tumour suppressors are main \nplayers in transformation and malignant progression, \nthey only account for a limited proportion of the \ndifferential gene expression observed in tumoral \ntissues, pointing out the involvement of additional \nfactors in supporting and scaling up tumours. In this \nregard, dysregulation of proteins acting as signaling \nnodes and eliciting post-translational modifications \nmight play a relevant role in different aspects of \ntumour cell behaviour (motility, cell cycle control, \nstress responses).  Our group is interested in the \nrole of kinases and other posttranslational modifiers \nin the dynamic rewiring of cell signaling networks, \nwhich could be susceptible to being therapeutically \ntargeted. Results of our laboratory showed that G protein-\ncoupled receptor kinase2 (GRK2) is a versatile \nmolecular hub that modulates signalling mediated by \nmany GPCRs and a growing array of cellular partners. \nGRK2 is emerging as a relevant onco-modulator in \nbreast cancer through complex regulatory loops \naffecting stress-related RNA binding proteins (HuR) \nin the angiogenic response to hypoxic and adrenergic \nstresses, E3 ubiquitin ligases (MDM2) on centrosome \ndynamics or cytosolic protein deacetylases (HDAC6) to \nfoster EGF signalling and motility, and the concurrent \nup-regulation of GRK2 and these activities emerges \nas a functional signature in breast cancer types \nbeyond the hormone-dependent status. \nOur research aims are to identify a) GRK2-governed \nsignalling circuits involved in breast cancer \nprogression and resistance, deciphering the relevant \ntargets modified by phosphorylation, acetylation, \nubiquitination; b) consequences of GRK2-based \nsignalosomes on cell cycle dynamics under stress \nconditions, and their role in cell cycle decision-\nmaking processes to differentiation, proliferation or \nsenescence; c) influence of hormonal (adrenergic, \nestrogenic), metabolic stresses and micro-\nenvironmental conditions on GRK2 intertwinement \nwith relevant partners for genomic stability an \nstroma remodelling, analysing changes in mammary \ngland morphology and epithelial organization, \naltered angiogenic processes and tissular fibrosis \nthat facilitate tumour growth and dissemination.CELLULAR SIGNALING NETWORKS IN CANCER (ONCO-RESECEL)\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/ppenelaGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nPetronila Penela\nPostdoctoral fellows\nTeresa Gonz\u00e1lez Mu\u00f1oz \n(since September 2022)\nDafne Garc\u00eda Mateos \n(since March 2022, co-\nsupervised with Catalina \nRibas)\nPredoctoral Fellows\nBel\u00e9n Ortiz del Castillo \nMaria Margarida Martins \nNeves  (until April 2021, \nco-supervised with Federico \nMayor)Angela Albitre  \n(co-supervised with \nFederico Mayor)\nViviana Marolda  \n(co-supervised with \nFederico Mayor)\nTechnicians\nEstefan\u00eda V\u00e1zquez de Oro \n(until September 2022)\nUndergraduate and \nMaster students\nPaula Casasano Mateos \n(2022)163\nMetabolic and Signaling Networks in Disease Unit\n CBM 2021-2022Imaging analysis of mouse mammary glands.

Genomic high-throughput \nsequencing has dramatically accelerated gene \ndiscovery and transformed metabolic precision \nmedicine. However, more than half of patients \nremain without a genetic cause identified. From \nthe more than 1400 pathologies categorized as \nIEM, there are only therapies for hundreds of IEMs. \nUsing a multi-omic layer approach in combination \nwith functional genomics, we have contributed to \nidentify new defects associated with pathology. We \nare highlighting identification of pathogenic variants: \ni) in a gene involved in the synthesis of coenzyme A \nassociated with a severe dilated cardiomyopathy \n(PPCDC), ii) in the moonlighting H-protein encoded \nby GCSH that has a dual role in protein lipoylation \nrequired for bioenergetic enzymes iii)  in genes \nother than SLC2A1 that usually has been associated \nwith GLUT1 transporter deficiency and iv) in YIF1B \nassociated with a severe neurodevelopment delay \ndescribing a new defect that combines a ciliopathies \nwith a Golgiphatie. \nRegarding therapies, we have been involved in the \ndevelopment of small chemical drugs targeted to \nrescue the activity of destabilizing mutant proteins as \na common mechanism for loss and gain of function \nmutations in IEM. We have published evidence \nregarding the possible use of small chemical molecules \nsuch as celastrol in combination with pharmacological \nchaperones (PC) in the treatment of the severe rare \ndiseases PMM2-CDG and methylmalonic aciduria, this last in combination with vitamin B12. Advancing \nthe development of pharmaco-chaperoning, we have \nobtained five complete crystal structures of hPMM2 \n(free and bound to the essential activator glucose-\n1,6-bisphosphate), three for the wild type and two \nfor the destabilizing p.Thr237Met variant. Using the \nstructure, we have proposed that ~80% and ~50% of \nthe missense variants of the core and cap domains \nrespectively are potential candidates for treatment \nwith PC. Furthermore, we have developed a drug \ndiscovery and screening platform using recombinant \nproteins and cellular models generated by CRISPRcas9 \ngene editing.  \nFor preclinical evaluation, we have generated cellular \nmodels from patients and healthy hiPSC. We highlight \nthe development of a protocol for the differentiation \nof iPSCs to hepatocyte-like cells (HLC) and their use \nas a preclinical model for the evaluation of PCs. In \nMMA, the HLC exhibited MMA disease hallmarks, and \nthe pharmaco-chaperon treatment in combination \nwith B12 significantly reduced the methylmalonic acid \nlevels and rescue the liver damage associated with \nthe disease.Group Members\nPrincipal Investigators \n(PI, co-PI): \nBel\u00e9n P\u00e9rez \nPilar Rodr\u00edguez-Pombo\nScientific Staff:  \nAlejandra G\u00e1mez Abascal \nPostdoctoral fellows: \nAlvaro Briso-Montiano  \n(until December 2021)\nPredoctoral fellows: \nLaura Arribas  \nDiana Gallego\nObdulia S\u00e1nchez Lijarcio\nCristina Segovia Falquina \nAlejandro Soriano Sexto\nAlicia Vilas LagoaTechnicians:\nElena Montalvo \nBlanca Rodr\u00edguez   \n(From November 2022)\nF\u00e1tima Leal\nRosa Navarrete\nUndergraduate and  \nMaster Students \nOlga Ram\u00edrez 2021- 2022  \n(TFG)\nLuis Calder\u00f3n 2011-2022  \n(TFM)\nAikaterini Stamatelaki, \nErasmus+ (Greece)TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE IN INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM \nAND OTHER RARE GENETIC DISEASES\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/bperez\nDoctoral theses\n \u00bbIrene Bravo Alonso (2021).

G-protein-coupled receptors \n(GPCRs) are a family of membrane proteins with great \nphysiological and pharmacological importance. In \nparticular, Gq protein-coupled receptors (Gq-GPCR) \nare increasingly involved in pathologies such as \ncardiovascular/metabolic diseases and cancer. In \nrecent years, the G\u03b1q interactome has expanded \nconsiderably with the description of new effectors, \nhelping to improve our understanding of the cellular \nand physiological events controlled by this G\u03b1 subunit. \nRecently, our group has contributed in the last year \nto unveil a new adapter role for Gq, through a new \ninteraction region in G\u03b1q, different from the classical \neffector-binding region. Our recent results reveal an \nunforeseen connection between non-canonical Gq \nsignaling and cell homeostasis. Furthermore, G\u03b1q \nis known to interact with various components of the \ncytoskeleton, as well as with important membrane \nmicrodomain organizers, suggesting the existence of \nsignaling complexes that could be limited to specific \nsubcellular environments.\nThe main objective of our group is to understand \nhow changes in Gq-GPCR signaling (involving \ndifferent types of cells and tissues) are integrated \nat the cellular and organism level, and how they can \npromote the progression of pathologies, using cell and animal models with altered expression/activity \nof this protein, as well as samples from patients or \nanimal models of disease. We will focus particularly \non the functional impact of this new interactome \nof G\u03b1q and its modulation by accessory proteins \n(such as GRKs, Caveolins, AGS, RGS, EBP50, Ric8), \nwith emphasis on how chemical and/or mechanical \ninputs on Gq signaling play a role in autophagy/\nexosome trafficking, endothelial dysfunction/\ninflammation and tumor microenvironment/cancer \nprogression. The identification of new signaling \npathways that relate G\u03b1q to the crosstalk between \ndifferent cell homeostasis and communication \nmachineries will provide a better understanding \nof the impact of maladaptive Gq-coupled GPCR \nactivation in pathological conditions.\nIn addition, and in close collaboration with other \nmembers of our CBMSO Programme, we use \ncellular and animal models with altered GRK2 levels \nor functionality to study:\n- Epidermal homeostasis and keratinocyte-immune \ncells crosstalk.

In this period, \nwe have differentiated them to cardiomyocytes which \nhave been characterized in relation to the biochemical \nphenotype, expression of miRNAs and genes in \ndifferent signaling pathways related to mitochondrial \nfunction and cardiac alterations, which are one of the \nmajor life-threatening complications in patients with \nthe disease. We have also successfully differentiated \niPSC to neuronal precursors and astrocytes, which in \nPA samples show a maturation defect, mitochondrial \ndysfunction, increased ROS levels and altered miRNAs \nexpression signatures.\nIn a collaborative study and using a hypomorph \nPA mouse model, we have demonstrated that \npharmacological inhibition of O-GlcNAcase, the \nenzyme removing O-GlcNAc from proteins, and \nspecifically from CPS1, catalysing the first step in the \nurea cycle, resulted in clinically relevant reductions \nof systemic ammonia, hallmark of PA disease, a \nstrategy that can also be applied to other genetic \nand acquired liver diseases.Ongoing projects related to splice modulation include \nproviding the proof of concept of the therapeutic use \nof antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) for a number of \nneurometabolic gene defects. For this aim, we have \ngenerated by CRISPR/Cas novel cellular and animal \nmodels with specific splicing variants in the PAH  \ngene, responsible for phenylketonuria. The aim is to \nstudy the molecular pathogenesis of patient specific \nmutations and to identify therapeutic ASO to correct \nthe splice defect. In other gene defects, we have \nfocused on the correction of the aberrant insertion in \nthe mRNA of pseudoexons activated by deep-intronic \nmutations. Such events are heavily underreported, a \nsituation that may change with the incorporation of \ntranscriptome sequencing as part of the diagnostic \npipeline. Thus, we have identified several pseudoexons \nprone to activation by different point mutations in the \nPTS gene, responsible for a tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) \nsynthesis defect resulting in hyperphenylalaninemia \nand monoamine neurotransmitter deficiency. We have \nidentified several ASO that can correct the aberrant \ninsertion of four overlapping pseudoexons activated \nby different mutations, resulting in protein recovery.\nIn addition to our work with splicing defects in \nneurometabolic diseases, we have recently identified \na series of ASO that modulate missplicing of a neuronal \nmicroexon involved in autism spectrum disorders and \nschizophrenia (collaboration with Dr. Jose J Lucas, \nCBMSO and Dr. Brage S.

PCT/EP2022/077882, Priority date 07 October 2021\nTitle holder: UAM/CSIC/University of Southern Denmark170\nPhysiological and Pathological Processes CBM 2021-2022\nSummary\nOur interests are understanding calcium regulation \nof mitochondrial function by way of the calcium-\ndependent mitochondrial carriers of aspartate-\nglutamate/AGCs (Aralar/AGC1 and citrin/AGC2), \ncomponents of the malate aspartate shuttle (MAS), \nor ATP-Mg2+/Pi carriers (SCaMCs). These carriers \nhave Ca2+-binding motifs facing the intermembrane \nspace and are not activated by matrix calcium. We \nalso aim at learning the role of these carriers in \nhealth and disease. \nIn neurons, calcium is thought to regulate neuronal \nactivation, by adjusting ATP production to ATP \nconsumption. This occurs thanks to stimulation \nof glycolysis and OXPHOS. The mitochondrial \ncalcium uniporter (MCU) was thought to play a \nmajor role by increasing mitochondrial calcium \nand OXPHOS in response to activation. We have \ntested this possibility in neurons using glucose \nand have found that MCU is dispensable for the \nincrease in respiration in response to neuronal \nstimulation. Instead, using intracellular sensors of \nglucose, pyruvate and lactate, we find that Aralar-\nMAS is required to stimulate glycolysis, pyruvate \nproduction and respiration, revealing a calcium \ndependent mechanism essential to boost glycolysis \nand respiration in neurons using glucose.In humans, Aralar/AGC1 deficiency is a rare disease \npresenting neurological and muscular affectation. \nPostnatal hypomyelination, epilepsy, hypotonia and \ndelayed neurodevelopment are the main traits in \npatients. Global Aralar-KO mice have a short lifespan \nand well recapitulates the human phenotype. \nOur main interest is focused on deciphering the \nphysiopathological role of Aralar/AGC1 in specific \nbrain cell types and in muscle. To face these \nissues, we have generated oligodendroglial- and \nneuron-specific Aralar-KO mice. To answer relevant \nquestions as: (a) the role of neuronal Aralar in the \nsevere phenotype of the global Aralar-KO mice (b) \nthe involvement of muscular- and neuronal-Aralar \nin motor coordination deficits and hypotonia, or (c) \nthe contribution of oligodendroglial and neuronal \nAralar to postnatal myelination, and demyelination-\nremyelination processes.  \nCitrin deficiency is an urea cycle disorder with \ndifferent manifestations. Citrin/AGC2 is mainly \nexpressed in liver and main clinical symptoms are \nhypoglycemia, hyperammonemia and dyslipidemia. \nIn the frame of the Citrin Foundation, we are \nexploring i) the exogenous expression of Aralar, \nwhich has low expression in human liver, as possible \ntherapy for Citrin deficiency and ii) the role of \nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigators: \nJorgina Satr\u00fastegui Gil-\nDelgado\nBeatriz Pardo Merino\nAraceli del Arco Mart\u00ednez\nCayetano von Kobbe \nAlonso\nScientific Staff:\nJos\u00e9 M.

In addition \nto ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation, \nthey participate in many pathways such as heat \nproduction, calcium signaling, detoxification of \nreactive oxygen species, synthesis of heme and other \nmolecules, and regulation of cell death. Emerging \nfunctions include their role in the regulation of innate \nand adaptive immune responses, which happens \nlargely by two mechanisms: \n1) The mitochondria regulate immunometabolism, \nwhich studies how the metabolism of the immune \ncell changes when they are activated or differentiate \ninto effector cell, and how those metabolic changes \nare essential for their effector function. For instance, \nM1 or proinflammatory macrophages in culture \nare largely glycolytic, whereas M2 or reparatory \nmacrophages utilize oxidative phosphorylation to \nmeet their ATP requirements.\n2) During dysfunction, the mitochondria\u2014due to \ntheir prokaryotic origin\u2014can produce and release \nmolecules (mitochondrial DNA, formyl peptides, \netc.) that activate diverse routes of innate immune \nsignaling, such as the NLRP3 inflammasome or the \ncGAS-STING pathway. This leads to the secretion of \nproinflamatory cytokines, including interleukin-1\u03b2 \nor type I interferons. \nThe mitochondria thus play a key role in immune \nregulation. The overarching goal of our group is to \nstudy the role of the mitochondria in the modulation \nof innate and adaptive immune pathways. We are particularly interested in how \nposttranslational modifications (PTMs) of \nmitochondrial proteins\u2014such as lysine acetylation \nor succinylation\u2014will regulate the activation and \npolarization of the macrophage. For this project, \nwe focus on the roles of mitochondrial nicotinamide \nadenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylases \n(like Sirtuin 3, SIRT3) or desuccinylases (like Sirtuin \n5, SIRT5). Indeed, we have recently found that SIRT3 \ncontrols the secretion of type I interferons, which \nare antiviral molecules.\nIn the laboratory, we also study the role of \nmitochondrial metabolites, including adenine \nnucleotides (adenosine mono-, di- or triphosphate) \nor NAD+, in the activation and differentiation of \nmacrophages and T lymphocytes. As transport of \nmetabolites across the inner mitochondrial membrane \nis carried out by proteins of the Mitochondrial Carrier \nFamily, we are altering the expression of mitochondrial \ncarriers specific for those metabolites in immune \ncells, including SLC25A24/SCaMC-1, a calcium-\ndependent mitochondrial transporter for ATP-Mg/\nPi, and SLC25A51/MCART1, the recently identified \nmitochondrial transporter for NAD+. \nSince autoimmune or degenerative diseases \nare associated with imbalances in macrophage \npolarity or lymphocyte lineage differentiation, the \nstudy of how mitochondrial metabolites affect the \ndifferentiation of immune cells, and its potential \nmodulation by compounds such as NAD+ precursors, \nmight be interesting for potential future therapies.www.cbm.uam.es/jtrabaGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nJavier Traba Dom\u00ednguez \nPredoctoral Fellow:\nCarolina Mero\u00f1o Ortega \n(March 2021 - present)\nPredoctoral Fellow: \nAurea Oliva Herrero \n(September 2021 - present)\nTechnician: \nRoc\u00edo Moreno Palomares \n(April 2022 - December \n2022)Yara Cuesta Valero \n(Undergraduate Student, \nApril 2021 \u2013 July 2021; \nMaster Student, February \n2022 \u2013 June 2022)\nAna Alcal\u00e1 Lalinde \n(Undergraduate Student, \nJanuary 2022 \u2013 June 2022)\nMaster Student: \nAlejandra Carrancho \nArroyo (January 2021 \u2013 July \n2021)MITOCHONDRIAL BIOLOGY IN IMMUNE MODULATION173\nMetabolic and Signaling Networks in Disease Unit\n CBM 2021-2022\nOverview of metabolic changes in macrophages and CD4+ T cells upon activation.

PROGRAM\n174175\nInteractions with  \nthe Environment176The immune system is in charge of maintaining the integrity of living organisms, \nprotecting them both from infectious diseases and from endogenous alterations of \ntissue homeostasis. However, its deregulation can lead to both immunodeficiencies \nand autoimmune disease and, furthermore, the cells of the immune system can \nbecome malignant themselves. In our Unit, basic and translational scientists are \nfocused on the study of the molecular, cellular, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms \nregulating the development and function of the cells of the immune system, and the \nbases of their interactions with self-components and pathogens, with the final goal \nof understanding its malfunction in pathological conditions as a key requirement for \ndeveloping novel therapeutic strategies. \nIn these two years, studying normal lymphocyte development, it was found that \nefficient signaling via the earliest form of the T-cell receptor (TCR) was critical \nfor generation of a diverse TCR repertoire, and mice with impaired signaling can \ngenerate hyperactive T-cells and may suffer from autoimmune reactions. Also, \nnovel insights were provided into the mechanisms that control thymic involution \nduring aging; indeed, a new role for Notch1 signaling in thymic epithelial cells was \nidentified, paving the way for novel therapies to improve T-cell production in aging \nand other clinical settings.\nRegarding lymphocyte activation and its role in normal and aberrant immune \nresponses, we have discovered that interleukin-23 controls protein synthesis and \ncellular metabolism to induce pathogenic functions in T cells, with implications for \nautoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Our groups have also identified novel \nunconventional roles of the autophagic machinery in the regulation of cytokine \nsignaling and inflammation. Also, novel targets of nitroalkylation by nitro-fatty acids \nhave been found involved in controlling T-cell activation, transcriptional induction \nand production of proinflammatory cytokines.\nC\u00e9sar CobaledaInteractions with  \nthe Environment\nImmune System Development  \nand Function UnitInteractions with the Environment CBM 2021-2022\n177In the field of hematopoietic malignancies, our groups have validated critical \nphysiological pathways of T-cell development as suitable targets for novel \nimmunotherapies, including Chimeric Antigen Receptors. They have also found that \npreventive pharmacological treatment of mice predisposed to childhood B-cell acute \nleukemia with JAK/STAT inhibitors protects them from the appearance of the disease. \nOur groups are also studying the metabolic and immune features of aggressive High \nGrade B Cell Lymphomas, to identify new targeted therapies against them.\nIn the context of the response against pathogens, a model of Trypanosoma cruzi \ninfection has shown a relationship between HCN4 overexpression and the risk of \nsudden death in Chagas disease; also, autoantibodies against the human protein \nsCha have been identified as biomarkers for the risk of such sudden death. Regarding \nviruses, metagenomic sequencing studies have uncovered the evolutionary history \nof ectromelia virus, which causes a mouse disease similar to human smallpox, and \nidentified unexpected genetic variability of human herpes simplex viruses. Other \ngroups are studying the immune response to viral infections, trying to develop \nstrategies that can contribute to vaccine development.\nFinally, with the global emergence of novel viral pandemics, several groups of the Unit \nare studying SARS-CoV-2 and monkeypox viruses from different perspectives, like the \nevaluation of airborne virus transmission in public places, the development of new \nassays for detection of antiviral antibodies, the characterization of the nature of the \nimmune response and the degree of protection conferred by infection or vaccination, \nor the characterization of the new virus clades.\nBalbino Alarcon\nSIGNAL TRANSDUCTION BY THE \nT-CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR\nAntonio Alcami\nIMMUNITY AND VIROMICS\nCesar Cobaleda Hern\u00e1ndez\nCELLULAR PLASTICITY IN \nDEVELOPMENT AND CANCER\nMargarita Del Val Latorre\nVIRAL IMMUNOLOGY\nManuel Fresno Escudero\nIMMUNE DEVELOPMENT AND \nINFLAMMATORY-MEDIATED \nDISEASESNuria Girones\nIMMUNOREGULATORY \nMECHANISMS IN THE \nDEVELOPMENT OF CHAGAS \nDISEASE: TRANSLATIONAL \nAPPLICATIONS\nMar\u00eda N.

The TCR contacts the antigen \nextracellularly through its variable \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains, which \nhave very short cytoplasmic tails, so that signal initiation \nis passed on to the CD3 subunits, which contain longer \ntails that can contact intracellular interactors. We have \nfound that the TCR is organized in the plasma membrane \nof resting T cells as oligomers of up to 20 TCRs that we \nhave named as TCR nanoclusters. We believe that the \norganization of the TCR in nanoclusters can explain in \npart the high sensitivity of T cells for antigen in spite the \nlow affinity of the monovalent TCR for pMHC. Indeed, \nwe have recently found that TCR nanoclustering allows \ncooperativity phenomena between pMHC-engaged \nand non-engaged TCRs. In addition, we have proposed \nthat conformational changes mediate the conversion of \npMHC-TCR contacts into CD3-driven intracellular signals, \nthus triggering the TCR. One of the consequences of \nthe conformational change in the TCR is the exposure \nof a proline-rich sequence (PRS) of CD3\u03b5 that becomes \navailable for binding to the adaptor protein Nck. We \nhave developed small molecular weight inhibitors of the \nrecruitment of Nck to the TCR as immunomodulatory \nagents. These inhibitors are orally available and show a \npotent prophylactic and therapeutic effect in different \nmodels of autoimmune diseases while sparing the T \ncell response to pathogens. Another direct effector of \nthe TCR is the small GTPase RRas2 (also known as TC21), \nwhich binds constitutively to the non-phosphorylated TCR and plays important roles in homeostatic signaling \nthrough PI3K. RRas2 is also a direct effector of the B cell \nantigen receptor (BCR). We are studying the role of RRas2 \nin physiological processes of T and B lymphocytes such \nas homeostatic control of the populations, formation of \nthe immunological synapse, thymic selection, germinal \ncenter formation, as well as in pathological processes \nsuch as formation of T and B cell lymphomas and \nleukemias. Our most exciting recent findings suggest \nthat RRas2 is an oncogenic driver in the generation \nof chronic lymphocytic leukemias and some types of \nbreast cancer. RRas2 drives the generation of cancer in \nthe absence of activating mutations which are common \nin KRas and other classic Ras GTPases. We are trying to \nfigure out the mechanisms and the relevance of RRas2 \nfor human cancer.http://www.cbm.uam.es/balarcon\nOther activities\nBooks\n \u00bbKumari, S., Schamel, W.W. and Alarcon, B.

We \nare characterizing poxvirus proteins secreted from \ninfected cells that interact with type I interferon, \ntumor necrosis factor or chemokines, and modulate \ntheir activity. We also work on a viral mechanism \nblocking DNA sensing (poxin/schlafen) that prevents \nthe activation of type I interferon induction. The \ncontribution of these viral proteins to pathogenesis \nis tested in a mouse model of infection (mousepox). \nUnderstanding the mechanism of action of these \nviral proteins provide information on the function of \nthe immune system and new strategies to control \nthe immune response. We are using this information \nto develop new anti-inflammatory therapeutic \napproaches that we may take to the clinic to block \ninflammatory responses that cause human diseases.\nOur projects on viral metagenomics have \nreconstructed the natural history of ectromelia virus \nisolates causing mousepox outbreaks in animal house \nfacilities around the world and provided the first \ngenomic sequence from a natural isolate. Studies \non herpesviruses showed that herpes simplex virus \n1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 generate greater diversity than \nexpected for DNA viruses. HSV-2, infecting genital \nmucosa, generates more variants than HSV-1, infecting \noronasal mucosa, and this may have contributed to \nthe evolutionary divergence of this viruses adapting \nto different anatomical niches. We are extending \nour environmental viral metagenomic projects to the identification of new viruses in Antarctic Dry \nValleys, Antarctic and Arctic lake sediments, and water \nsamples from Alpine ecosystems in the Ordesa and \nMonte Perdido National Park in the Pyrenees. These \nstudies may identify common properties of viruses \nthat inhabit polar and alpine regions, similar extreme \necosystem separated geographically.\nThe COVID19 pandemic has illustrated the importance \nof airborne virus transmission and the need to \nimprove the microbiological quality of the air. During \nthe COVID19 pandemic we optimized a filtration \ntechnology to capture airborne viruses and have \nused it to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the \nair of hospitals and to sequence complete genomes \nof viruses present in air samples. We are extending \nthese studies to other human respiratory viruses. \nUsing this technology, we demonstrated the presence \nof mpox (monkeypox) virus in air samples during the \nrecent 2022 international mpox outbreak, suggesting \nthat airborne transmission may play a role in future \noutbreaks of mpox. In collaboration with technologists, \nwe are developing new methods to sample airborne \nviruses and to inactivate viruses in the air.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator (PI)\nAntonio Alcam\u00ed\nScientific Staff\nBruno Hern\u00e1ez\nPostdoctoral fellows\nAngela V\u00e1zquez\nAfrica Sanchiz\nRafael Gonz\u00e1lez Serrano \n(from 01/05/2021)\nPredoctoral fellows\nSergio S\u00e1nchez Carrillo\nJavier Alvarez de Miranda\nIsabel AlonsoTechnicians\nRoc\u00edo Mart\u00edn\nMar\u00eda del Carmen \nFern\u00e1ndez Moyano\nCarolina S\u00e1nchez\nMar\u00eda Teresa Garc\u00eda \nCastey (from 24/01/2022)\nUndergraduate and \nMaster Students\nMiguel Angel Salazar \n(01/02/2021-30/07/2021)\nwww.cbm.uam.es/antonio_alcamiIMMUNITY AND VIROMICS\nDoctoral theses\n \u00bbCarlos Fern\u00e1ndez Linares (2021).

Interestingly, \nalmost 5% of all newborn children present an inborn \ngenetic predisposition to develop B-ALL. Luckily, very \nfew (<1%) of these predisposed children will progress to \nB-ALL, by suffering a second hit that leads to full-blown \ndisease. The causes that trigger this progression are \nstill unclear, but B-ALL incidence seems to be increasing \nin parallel with the adoption of modern lifestyles. A \nstress on the immune system has been postulated to \nbe involved in the progression to B-ALL, and this stress \ncould be triggered by exposure to common infections \n(under certain circumstances), or by other stressors \nlike antibiotics, diet, or alterations in the microbiota. \nTherefore, understanding the interaction between \nthe immune stress and the preleukemic cells existing \nin so many newborns could provide us with strategies \naimed at preventing childhood B-ALL. We have generated mice expressing the oncogenic \nlesions responsible for the initiation of childhood \nB-ALLs, and we have demonstrated that common \ninfections are indeed one of the main triggering factors \nleading to leukemia development. Furthermore, \nwe have shown that preventive pharmacological \ntreatment of predisposed mice with inhibitors of \nthe JAK/STAT oncogenic signaling pathway protects \nthem from the appearance of the disease, showing \nthat B-ALL could be a preventable disease.  Since the \npresence of latent premalignant cells is a common \ncharacteristic of many types of cancers, our results \noffer a general proof-of-principle for the development \nof similar preventive strategies for other malignancies.\nWolf Hirschhorn Syndrome (WHS) is a complex \nrare disease, and affected patients present many \nsevere problems, including life-threatening \nimmunodeficiencies. One of the genes affected in WHS \nis WHS-Candidate-1 (WHSC1) , an epigenetic regulator \ninvolved in many processes affecting genome function \nand that, interestingly, is also mutated in childhood \nB-ALLs and other malignancies of B-cell origin \nlike Multiple Myeloma. We are using GEMMs with \nderegulated WHSC1 function to gain insight into the \nmolecular biology of WHS-associated hematopoietic \npathologies, in order to better understand the role \nof epigenetics in normal and aberrant hematopoietic \ndevelopment, and to develop future prospective \ntherapeutic interventions. \nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator\nC\u00e9sar Cobaleda Hern\u00e1ndez\nPostdoctoral fellows\nAlba Azagra Rodr\u00edguez (October 2021-October 2022)\nPredoctoral fellows\nJorge Mart\u00ednez Cano\nJavier Isoler Alcaraz (co-IP: Mar\u00eda G\u00f3mez)\nUndergraduate and Master Students\nAntonio Gir\u00e1ldez Trujillo (January-June 2022)\nSof\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez Rodr\u00edguez  (January-June 2021)CELLULAR PLASTICITY IN DEVELOPMENT AND CANCER\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/ccobaleda183\nImmune System Development and Function Unit\n CBM 2021-2022List of publications\n \u00bbCobaleda, C, Vicente-Due\u00f1as C and Sanchez-Garcia I.

Therefore, our main goal \nis developing approaches to induce a potent, long-\nlasting T-lymphocyte immune response. Our work \nhas also focused on vulnerable populations, such \nas immunocompromised individuals as well as the \nelderly, trying to address approaches improving \nvaccine efficiency as well as measuring the strength \nand durability of their immune response to \nvaccination, aiming at revealing critical parameters \nof vaccine-mediated protection from disease in \nthese populations.\nWe study the immune response to infection in \nimmunocompromised individuals using two \ndifferent mouse models, deficient in: 1) The \ntransporter associated with antigen processing \n(TAP), a crucial player in the MHC class I antigen \npresentation pathway for recognition by CD8+ \nT lymphocytes, which are the effector cells \nresponsible for the elimination of infected cells in \nvivo. TAP is frequently deleted in metastases and is \nalso targeted by viruses, resulting in both instances \nin evasion from the detection, and elimination, by these T lymphocytes. 2) The GTPase N-ras, a \ndeficiency that we have shown to lead to a defective \nanti-viral memory CD8+ T-lymphocyte response. The \nviral infection models we are using are vaccinia virus \n(VACV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). VACV is \nthe vaccine vector used for the complete eradication \nof variola virus, the agent causing smallpox. MCMV, \nas a model for human cytomegalovirus, remains \nlatent and leads to the generation for life of a massive \nnumber of viral epitope-specific T lymphocytes, a \nphenomenon termed \u201cinflationary memory.\u201d\nWe are also focusing on the antiviral immunity \nin the elderly, a highly vulnerable segment of the \npopulation. In the wake of the pandemic caused by \nSARS-CoV-2, the group refocused part of its research \nand know-how to address the immune response to \ninfection by, and vaccination against, SARS-CoV-2. \nWe are carrying out a global analysis of the adaptive \nand innate immune response, establishing the \npresence of neutralizing antibody and T-lymphocyte \nanti-SARS-CoV-2 responses. We are also pursuing to \nextend this knowledge to new emerging diseases, \nby focusing on the mpox  outbreak, analyzing the \nprotective immune response in the elderly from \nsmallpox vaccinations performed more than fifty \nyears earlier.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nMargarita Del Val Latorre\nScientific Staff:\nLuis C.

Interestingly, the 2 major isoforms, TCFL5_E1/E8 \nand TCFL5_E2b/E8 (CHA) had a different promoter and \nopposite functions, being TCFL5_E2b/E8 protumoral \nfunction. TCFL5_E1/E8 is essential for NFKB2 activity \nregulating the expression of anti-apoptotic genes as \nBCL2 whereas TCFL5_E2b/E8 controls the expression \nof the pluripotency markers SOX2, NANOG and \nKLF4. We have identified some genes regulated by \nTCFL5_E1/E8 and TCFL5_E2b/E8 and established its \nrole in some leukemias and in normal lymphopoiesis. \nTCFL5_E2b/E8 expression was associated with greater \nseverity in lymphoma and myeloma samples from \npatients. Using Tcfl5  deficient mice, we found Tcfl5 is \nrequired for the formation of germinal centers and \ndifferentiation of pro-B to pre-B cells by affecting \nthe levels of SYK and BCR signalling, resulting in an \ninability to respond to stimuli and an increase in cell \ndeath. TCFL5 is also expressed during early mouse \nembryonic development, the preimplantation period \nand plays a role in the differentiation of embryonic cells \nto germline precursors by controlling the expression \nof genes important in their differentiation, as shown \nin Tcfl5 deficient mice.\nToll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in pathogen \nrecognition. However, signaling via TLR4 and TLR2 was different, as TLR2 ligands activated NF-\u03baB and \nMAPKs earlier and exhibited a higher IL-10 /IL-12 ratio \ncompared to TLR4 ligands. Furthermore, p38 MAPK is \ncritical for IL-10 expression in response to TLR2 ligands, \nwhich triggers the macrophage change to a M2 and \nregulatory phenotype in contrast to the M1 phenotype \ninduced by TLR4 activation. TRIF was required for \nIFN-\u03b2 induction and consequent expression of IL-12 in \nresponse to TLR2. Moreover, in vivo administration of \nTLR2 ligands exert a modulatory effect on cytokines \nwith beneficial effects on the prevention of Listeria \ndissemination in a murine model of neonatal listeriosis.\nTLR4 is considered the major receptor to recognize all \nLPSs. However, some atypical LPS\u2019s depart from the \nwell-studied E. coli  LPS and induce a TLR2-dependent \ninflammatory response in immune cells. Molecular \ndocking analysis of O. intermedium LPS predicts a \nfavorable formation of a TLR2/TLR4/MD-2 heterodimer, \nfurther confirmed by FRET. These imply that atypical \nLPSs may induce TLR4/TLR2 heterodimerization to \ndecrease the bacteria activation of the innate immune \nsystem. \nFinally, we were also working on Chagas\u2019 disease caused \nby Trypanosoma cruzi (see N. Giron\u00e8s page) and \ncontributed to understand some immunological aspects \nof COVID 19 infection (see corresponding page).\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator\nManuel Fresno Escudero\nScientific Staff\nKonstantinos Stamatakis \nAndriani\nPostdoctoral fellows\nMaria Pilar Ubeda Cantera\nAngela Rodriguez Garcia \nRendueles\nJavier Gal\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez. \nUntil 21.4.2022\nPredoctoral fellows\nIn\u00e9s S\u00e1nchez Gomez.

We also studied the prognostic \nvalue of circulating miRNAs in Chagas disease \npatients, and the alterations in miRNA expression \nin macrophages infected with T. cruzi, and identified \nfor the first time the presence of T. cruzi miRNAs \nin the infected culture that localize in extracellular \nvesicles (EVs).\nWe studied cardiac remodeling in the experimental \nmouse model of T. cruzi infection, and found \noverexpression of HCN4 channels, suggesting that \narrythmogenic treatments should be administered \nwith caution in Chagas disease patients since they \ncan have secondary effects (Rodriguez-Angulo H.O. \net al. 2021).We determined the complete genome of \nmitochondrial maxicircle and minicircles of T. cruzi . \nIt was previously thought that minicircles were \ncircular dsDNA composed of 4 repetitive elements, \nbut using NGS sequencing we also found minicircles \nof 3, 2 and 1 repeats in the mitochondrial DNA. \nThese findings are relevant because little is known \nabout the role of the T. cruzi mitochondrial genome, \nand these findings may help to understand better \nthe molecular biology of the parasite for fighting \nthe infection (Callejas-Hern\u00e1ndez F. et al. 2021).\nFinally, we showed that autoantibodies against the \nimmunodominant sCha (a TCFL5 isoform) epitope \ndiscriminate the risk of sudden death in chronic \nChagas cardiomyopathy. Autoantibody levels \ncorrelated with the alterations found in 24h Holter \nECG recording for the detection of arrhythmias \nand prevention of sudden death, and thus having a \npotential application as an alternative when Holter \nECG is not available (Rodr\u00edguez-Angulo H.O. et al. \n2021). We also collaborated in studies about the \nrole of TCFL5 in spermatogenesis (Gal\u00e1n-Mart\u00ednez \nJ, Berenguer I.et al. 2022) and colorectal cancer \n(Gal\u00e1n.Mart\u00ednez J., Stamatakis K. et al., 2022) with \nthe research group of Dr. Manuel Fresno.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator (PI): \nN\u00faria Giron\u00e8s \nPredoctoral Fellows: \nAlfonso Herreros Cabello \nJavier del Moral Salmoral\nIn\u00e9s S\u00e1nchez G\u00f3mez\nTechnicians:\nCarolina Maroto Gonz\u00e1lez\nJavier del Moral Salmoral\nDiana Karolina Santos Pe\u00f1aloza\nUndergraduate and Master Students: \nMario G\u00f3mez Montes\nAndrea Rodrigo Castro\nVisiting scientists:\nH\u00e9ctor Omar Rodr\u00edguez AnguloIMMUNOREGULATORY MECHANISMS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF \nCHAGAS DISEASE: TRANSLATIONAL APPLICATIONS\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/ngirones189\nImmune System Development and Function Unit\n CBM 2021-2022List of publications\n \u00bbGal\u00e1n-Mart\u00ednez J, Berenguer I, Del Carmen Maza M, \nStamatakis K, Giron\u00e8s N, Fresno M.

Therefore, there is a need for \ndevelopment of novel treatments for this type of \nconditions. The chronic inflammatory diseases are \ninitiated by an uncontrolled immune response that \ntriggers the hyper-activation of signalling cascades, \npromoting the accumulation of pro-inflammatory \nmediators and finally, the manifestation of clinical \nsymptoms. In different chronic inflammatory \ndiseases, the axis formed by interleukin 23 and \ninterleukin 17 (IL-23/IL-17) has emerged as a key \nsignalling hub in pathologies such as psoriasis, \ninflammatory bowel diseases, multiple sclerosis or \nrheumatoid arthritis in murine models and more \nimportantly, in humans. The pathogenic effects \nof IL-23 have been linked to its ability to promote \nthe production of inflammatory mediators, mainly \ninterleukin 17 and 22 (IL-17/IL-22). These secreted \nmediators amplify intercellular communication \nnetworks, causing a chronic inflammation and \nfinally, clinical symptoms. IL-23 pathogenic actions \nare mostly restricted to distinct subpopulations \nof T lymphocytes: the CD4 helper subset Th17 \nand the TCR\u03b3\u03b4 subpopulation T\u03b3\u03b417. Therapeutic \nstrategies aimed at inhibiting the intracellular signalling networks triggered by different receptors \nhave been successfully applied for treatment of \ninflammatory diseases and cancer. Despite the \nprominent role of IL-23 in diseases, these therapeutic \napproaches have not been fully exploited in the \ncontext of inflammatory pathologies since the IL-\n23 signalling cascade remains largely unknown. \nOur lab is interested in the characterisation of \nthe signalling network triggered by IL-23 and \nother pro-inflammatory cytokines, as a strategy \nto uncover novel mediators of cytokine signalling \nfor the development of therapeutic tools based \non the interference with intracellular signalling \npathways. Recently, the lab has discovered how \ninterleukin 23 promotes pathogenic T cell migration \nto the inflamed site, and that interleukin-23 controls \nprotein synthesis and cellular metabolism to induce \npathogenic functions in T cells. In the next years, we \nwill address how the pharmacological manipulation \nof metabolic routes in immune cells can be used \nfor treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. \nMoreover, a screening platform developed in the lab \nwill identify novel drugs and bioactive compounds to \ninterfere with pro-inflammatory signalling cascades \nfor management of autoimmunity.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator: \nMar\u00eda N.

Principal investigator.192\nInteractions with the Environment CBM 2021-2022\nSummary\nDiffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most \ncommon lymphoid malignancy in adults and \nrepresents a heterogeneous group of tumors with \ndistinct subtypes that differ in genetic alterations, \nclinical outcome, response to treatment and \nprognosis. Approximately 5-15% of DLBCL are high \ngrade B cell lymphomas (HGBL) with rearrangements \nof MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6, and they are known \nas \u201cdouble-hit\u201d lymphoma (DHL) or \u201ctriple hit \nlymphoma\u201d (THL). Due to simultaneous activation \nof these driver oncogenes, DHLs are among the \nmost aggressive and chemoresistant lymphoma \nsubtype with minimal treatment options and have \npoor outcomes. Furthermore, the co-expression \nof MYC and BCL2 proteins without underlying \nrearrangements is considered a new adverse \nprognostic indicator termed double-expressor \nlymphoma (DEL). Deregulated MYC expression \ncontributes to metabolic reprogramming in \ntumor cells through a complex network of factors. \nSpecifically, c-MYC-transformed lymphoma B cells \nrely on glutamine metabolism for bioenergetics and redox homeostasis. In addition, serine metabolism, \nthrough the enhanced activity of SHMT2 enzyme, \ncontributes to the biology of MYC-aggressive \nlymphomas. However, the metabolic features of the \nHGBL-DH lymphomas are not fully understood and \ncould imply potentially targetable vulnerabilities. \nUnderstanding the unique biology of these tumors, \nincluding metabolism, could provide a rationale for \nexploring targeted agents beyond the current focus \non BCL2 and MYC inhibitors.\nOur lab, which opened its doors on September \n2021, aims to characterize the metabolic features \nof these particular tumors using transcriptomic \nand metabololomic tools in preclinical models \nand patient samples, and screen new metabolic \nvulnerabilities that could be used as new targeted \ntherapies for these aggressive lymphomas with \nvery poor outcomes with the standard therapies.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator: \nAna Ortega Molina (since September 2021)\nPredoctoral Fellow:\nBeatriz Lopez Mart\u00edn-Lunas (since October 2022)\nTechnicians:\nCristina Lebrero Fern\u00e1ndez \n(November 2021-November 2022)\nNerea Delgado Mayenco (July 2022-Sepember 2022)\nMarta Jim\u00e9nez Mu\u00f1oz (since November 2022)\nUndergraduate and Master Students:\nNerea Regueira Acebedo (February 2022-July 2022)\nSara Salazar Ortego  (since December 2022)\nMarta Gonz\u00e1lez P\u00e9rez  (since December 2022)METABOLISM IN CANCER AND AGING\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/aortega193\nImmune System Development and Function Unit\n CBM 2021-2022List of publications\n \u00bbOrtega-Molina A, Efeyan A.

Judging \nfrom the pathological phenotypes observed in mice \nlacking members of the autophagic machinery (the \nso-called ATGs), autophagy has an important role in \nprotection against a variety of pathologies, including \ncancer, inflammatory diseases or neurodegenerative \ndisorders. This protective capacity suggests that \nmanipulation of autophagy could hold therapeutic \nvalue, a possibility that is being intensely studied by \na variety of laboratories around the world. However, \nit is nowadays becoming clear that the different ATGs \nalso have alternative functions not strictly related to \nthe canonical autophagic pathway. The contribution \nof these alternative activities to preventing the \npathological phenotypes caused by ATG elimination is \ncurrently unclear, but their characterization is important \nbecause it could determine the way ATG activity could \nbe manipulated with therapeutic purposes.\nWith this goal in mind, the lab focuses on ATG16L1 as \na paradigm to discover new unconventional activities \nof the autophagic machinery. In its most canonical \nfunction, ATG16L1 is critical for proper formation of \nautophagosomes, double-membrane vesicles that \nsequester the cellular material that will eventually be \ndegraded in the lysosome. However, ATG16L1 includes \na C-terminal domain that is irrelevant for this activity \nand seems to play unconventional roles in a wide variety of cellular processes. Projects currently being \ndeveloped in the lab intend to discover and characterize \nin detail novel unconventional functions of ATG16L1 \ncarried out through this domain, and explore how \nthey interact with the conventional pathway. Areas of \ninterest in the lab in the 2021-22 period have focused \non the role of unconventional autophagy in: \n1)  The regulation of endocytosis, intracellular \ntrafficking and signaling output of cytokine \nreceptors \n2)  The regulation of immunogenic cell death and its \nimpact in cancer biology\n3)  The innate immune response against intracellular \nbacterial infections\nTo identify and characterize these processes we use \na variety of genetically manipulated experimental \nsystems, proteomics and bioinformatics approaches. \nWe are trying to characterize these mechanisms and \nexplore how they may be influenced by a coding \npolymorphic allele of ATG16L1 (T300A) whose presence \nin homozygosis increases the risk of suffering Crohn\u2019s \ndisease, a serious intestinal inflammatory disease. \nExploring and establishing ways to manipulate \natypical autophagy with therapeutic intentions is also \na central long-term goal of our group that we intend to \ndevelop over the next few years.Group Members\nPrincipal Investigators (PI, co-PI):\nFelipe X.

Our research lines are \ndedicated to the study the role played by NO as well \nas nitro and oxo modified fatty acids in inflammation \nand in the activation and differentiation of T \nlymphocytes. We are currently studying the actions \nexerted by these agents on the activation of human \nT lymphocytes, analysing their involvement in \nthe regulation of gene expression and activation \nof transcription factors. We are also interested in \nthe analysis of chemotaxis, intercellular adhesion \nand the organization of adhesion and signalling \nreceptors at the immune synapse. In addition, we \nare also examining the potential actions of these \ncompounds on the selection of the adaptive immune \nresponse in human T lymphocytes.\nNO is a key messenger in the pathogenesis of \ninflammation. In the immune system, NO has been \nconsidered to be a cytotoxic molecule associated \nwith the response of phagocytic cells to pathogens as \npart of the first line of host defence against infection. \nHowever, NO can also regulate the adaptive immune \nresponse, linking innate and adaptive immunity. NO \naffects T helper cell differentiation and the effector \nfunctions of T lymphocytes, and is a potential target \nfor therapeutic manipulation. In the last years, our group has been interested in the study of the \nregulatory actions exerted by NO in T cell functions, \nfocusing on protein S-nitrosylation and fatty acid \nnitro-alkylation, leading to the formation NO2-FA, as \nimportant post-translational modifications by which \nNO can act as a signalling molecule during T cell-\nmediated immunity.\nFatty acid oxidative modifications result in \nthe production of bioactive lipids including \nprostaglandins and NO2-FA, important signalling \nmolecules that can modulate the inflammatory \nprocess and the immune response. We are \ninterested in the analysis of their influence on \ndiverse parameters of T lymphocyte function, \nfocusing on their effects on transcriptional activation \nand gene expression and their consequences \non cell activation and differentiation. Their anti-\ninflammatory and immunomodulatory effects take \nplace mainly through their ability to covalently \nmodify transcriptional regulatory proteins and \nenzymes and to activate various nuclear and \nmembrane receptors, finally modifying protein \nfunction and altering patterns of gene expression. \nResearch on the molecular and cellular basis of the \nactions of electrophilic fatty acids in inflammation \nand the immune response, will contribute to the \nunderstanding of the potential therapeutic benefits \nof these compounds.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigators:  \nJuan Manuel Serrador\nMiguel \u00c1ngel \u00cd\u00f1iguez\nPredoctoral Fellows:\n\u00c1ngel Bago (until October 2021)\nAlba Gil (from April 2021)\nClaudia Guerra (from September 2022)\nTechnicians: \nAna Renshaw\nLaura Cayuela (until February 2022)\nUndergraduate and Master Students: \nValentina Canino Avil\u00e9s  (From July 2021 to July 2022)NITRIC OXIDE AND BIOACTIVE LIPIDS IN THE IMMUNE RESPONSE\nhtttps://www.cbm.uam.es/immune_NO_bioactive_lipids197\nImmune System Development and Function Unit\n CBM 2021-2022List of publications\n \u00bbCacheiro-Llaguno, C., Hern\u00e1ndez-Subir\u00e1, E., D\u00edaz-Mu\u00f1oz, \nD.M., Fresno, M., Serrador, J.M., and \u00cd\u00f1iguez, M.A. (2022). \nRegulation of Cyclooxygenase-2 Expression in Human \nT Lymphocytes by Glucocorticoid Receptor\u2013Mediated \nTransrepression of Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells.

Our goal is to obtain \nmechanistic information about how dysregulation \nof particular intrathymic physiological pathways \nleads to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), \nwith the final aim of identifying specific molecular \ntargets for therapeutic intervention. Focusing on \nthe NOTCH1 pathway as a major driver of T-ALL, \nwe recently developed a novel in vivo model of de \nnovo  generation of human T-ALL, which revealed \nthe contribution of several NOTCH1 targets at \ndistinct stages of T-ALL pathogenesis. In the last \ntwo years, this information was used together \nwith proprietary monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) \nand patented technology for de novo generation \nof human effector T cells, to develop state-of-the-\nart therapeutic strategies targeting T-ALL-specific \nmolecules, including chimeric antigen receptors- \n(CAR-) armed T cells, therapeutic antibody-drug \nconjugates (ADCs), and secreting T-cell engaging \nantibodies (STAbs). We also generated cutting-\nedge preclinical models for in vivo validation of our \nT-ALL immunotherapy strategies, as an obligatory \nstep preceding clinical translation. Our results have \nprovided promising preclinical results as proof \nof concept of the suitability of new targets for \nimplementation of next-generation efficacious and safe strategies overcoming current challenges of \nT-ALL immunotherapy. \nOn the other hand, we have studied the \nspatiotemporal regulation of NOTCH1 activation in \nthe postnatal human thymus and have uncovered \na novel role for NOTCH1 signaling in thymus \nbiology. We found that in vivo activation of NOTCH1 \nis not confined to thymic hematopoietic cells as \nexpected; rather, NOTCH1 signaling is also induced \nin thymic epithelial cells (TECs), and increases \nsignificantly with age, mostly in the medullary TEC \n(mTEC) compartment, in humans and also in mice, \nsuggesting a conserved role for NOTCH1 in TEC \nhomeostasis during thymus aging. Accordingly, \nwe found that organization and integrity of the \npostnatal thymus critically depends on Notch \nactivation, as specific abrogation of canonical Notch \nsignaling in epithelial cells (Foxn1Cre/+ x RBPj\u03bafl/fl \nmutant mice), led to a significant disruption of the \nmedullary thymic microenvironment, accompanied \nby a decrease of mTEC numbers, resulting in an \naccelerated thymus involution. These data uncover \na new role for NOTCH1 activation in the control of \nadult TEC homeostasis, and point toward Notch \nsignaling manipulation as a novel strategy for \nthymus regeneration therapies to improve T-cell \nproduction in aging and other clinical settings. This \npossibility is currently under investigation.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal investigator:\nMar\u00eda Luisa Toribio Garc\u00eda\nPostdoctoral fellows:\nMarina Garc\u00eda Peydr\u00f3\nPatricia Fuentes Villarejo\nSara Gonz\u00e1lez Garc\u00eda\nPredoctoral fellows:\nAlba Murcia Ceballos (until October 2021)\nF\u00e1tima Bay\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n\nCarmela Cela Rodr\u00edguez \nTechnicians:\nJuan Alcain S\u00e1nchez\nElo\u00edsa Castillo Guti\u00e9rrez\nUndergraduate and Master Students: \nAdri\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez Rego  (until June 2021)DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN LYMPHOHEMATOPOIETIC SYSTEM\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/toribiolab199\nImmune System Development and Function Unit\n CBM 2021-2022List of publications\n \u00bbToribio ML, Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u00eda S.

Licenced to One Chain Immunotherapeutics.200\nInteractions with the Environment CBM 2021-2022\nSummary\nT cells use their T cell receptor (TCR) to continuously \nscan Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) \nmolecules presenting a repertoire of peptides \nderived from the proteome present in the host. \nPresentation of pathogen-derived peptides gives rise \nto protective immune responses, while responses \nagainst peptides from host proteins can lead to \nauto-immunity. We study how the organization of \nthe TCR into nanoclusters allows T cells to become \nactivated upon recognition of only a few peptide-\nbound MHC molecules and apply our knowledge \nof the molecular mechanisms of TCR signaling \nto development of new versions of recombinant \nimmune receptors for cancer immunotherapy. \nUsing transgenic mouse models that impair TCR \nnanoclusters formation and signaling strength of \nthe TCR, we described a previously unknown, TCR \nsignaling strength-regulated set point at the first \nstage of thymic T cell development that determines \nthe diversity of the mature T cell repertoire. This set \npoint permits early T cells with reduced signaling \ncapacity to progress, albeit less efficiently, to \nthe next developmental stages and these hypo-\nresponding cells may contribute to the occurrence \nof self-reactive clones in the mature T cell repertoire. \nOur research on miniTCRs, that combine antigen \nrecognition domains of the TCR with signaling \ndomains similar to Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) and should allow for development of tumor-\nspecific recombinant T cells, shows that the identity \nand topology of the signaling domains of these \nminiTCRs determines their efficiency with respect \nto activating the T cells. These results have a direct \nimplication for improving CAR-based cellular cancer \nimmunotherapy. They also have provided insight \ninto the mechanisms that underlie full TCR function, \nwhich we are currently following-up upon.\nWe also have generated a new type of CAR-T cells \nagainst Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Cellular \nImmunotherapy against this type of cancer has been \nseverely hampered by unacceptable toxicity against \nthe patient\u2019s myeloid precursors that express the \nsame antigen as the ones targeted on AMLs. We \nuse a logical gate formed by an activating CAR \nrecognizing an antigen expressed by precursors \nand most AMLs and an inhibitory immune receptor \nthat recognizes a ligand only expressed by the \nmyeloid precursors. We obtained evidence that \nlogically gated CAR-T cells can discriminate between \nCAR target-expressing cells based on presence or \nabsence of the ligand for the inhibitory receptor. We \nwill test optimized versions of these CAR-T cells in \npre-clinical models of cancer immunotherapy, a first \nand necessary step to test its potential for clinical \napplication.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigators (PI, co-PI):\nHisse Martien van Santen\nPredoctoral fellows:\nIvaylo Balabanov\nLydia H\u00f6rndler Gil\nUndergraduate Students: \nDavid S\u00e1nchez M\u00e9ndez,  since Sept 2022\nAlba Rodr\u00edguez Mac\u00eda, since Sept 2022TCR DOMAINS IN T CELL DIFFERENTIATION AND \nPATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL AND THERAPEUTIC RESPONSES\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/vansanten-researchgroup201\nImmune System Development and Function Unit\n CBM 2021-2022List of publications\n \u00bbBovolenta ER, Garc\u00eda-Cuesta EM, Horndler L, \nPonomarenko J, Schamel WA, Mellado M, Castro M, Abia \nD, van Santen HM (2022).

Also, cellular and acellular microbes are suitable models to gain \ninsight in eukaryotic cell biology and tools and source of biotechnological and \nbiomedical products that improve economy and health.  Accordingly, the overall \nscientific objective of the \u201cMicrobes in Health and Welfare\u201d (MHW) unit is to study \nbasic and applied aspects of the interactions of microbes with their hosts and the \nenvironment.\nIn the last two years, research groups of our unit have made the following relevant \nadvances. Regarding basic science, our virologists have obtained evidences of how \nanti-HIV-1 drugs modulate mechanical properties of the viral capsid by using atomic \nforce microscopy, and the way viruses evade the host immune system through \nviral proteases. Bacteriologists of the unit have studied environmental adaptations \nlike how biogeochemical cycles operate in deep subsurface environments, or the \nidentification of proteins and sRNAs involved in cold adaptation in a relevant food \npathogen. Also, studies on conjugation in Gram-positive bacteria have led to the \ndiscovery of a novel two-component antitermination system and the molecular \nmechanism of covalent binding between mating pairs, whereas studies in extreme \nthermophiles have revealed the role of recombination-related proteins in defense \nagainst invading DNA.\nJos\u00e9 BerenguerInteractions with  \nthe Environment\nMicrobes in Health  \nand Welfare unit\nInteractions with the Environment CBM 2021-2022\n203On more applied fields, biomedical aspects were addressed on topics such as the use \nof biosafe viruses as therapeutic agents against human brain tumours in orthotopic \npreclinical models, the development of new vaccine prototypes, either attenuated viral \nforms lacking several genes or protective synthetic dendrimeric peptides vaccines \nand noncoding sRNA-based antivirals against animal and human viruses.  Relevant \nachievements in the applied branch include new antiviral therapeutic strategies \nagainst HIV, SARS-Cov2 and other RNA viruses, and the development of new methods \nfor the in-silico discovery of new carbapenemases inhibitors. \nFinally, the MHW unit has been involved in biotechnology-focused research with \napplications outside the biomedical field, like the engineering of capsid-based \nnanostructured proteins with increased mechanical resistance and self-healing, \nthe discovery of new enzymes and the thermostabilization of known ones through \n(ultra)high-throughput methods, or the description and use of new enzymes for the \nproduction of rare oligosaccharides and glycosylated compounds for the food industry \nand biomedical applications.\nJos\u00e9 M.

In our recent report, we describe \nthat human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), with \npatient-specific p53 mutants and p53-Ser15 \nphosphorylation, are selective targets for two MVM \nstrains (p, i) that are non-pathogenic for humans. \nThese MVM strains induced a DNA Damage \nResponse (DDR) in GSCs growing as neurospheres \nand disrupted the architecture of GSC-derived brain \ntumors in orthotopic rodent models (see Figure 1A), \nshowing promise for biosafe personalized therapy \nagainst human cancers with p53 deregulations.\nOther major related issues being explored include \nattempting physical and chemotherapeutic \ntreatments to overcome cellular innate \nresponses of cancer cells against MVM infection, \nand targeting MVM infection to the tumour \nvasculature by engineering the MVM capsid with \nVEGF peptides. Further, major efforts are being \ndedicated to exploring evolutionary strategies to \ndevelop parvoviruses with improved anticancer \nproperties by optimizing their cytotoxicity and \nreplication capacity in human tumour cells. For this, we are exploring the phenotypic features \nof (i) naturally evolved MVM variants with distinct \ntropism and pathogenicity, (ii) chimeric viruses \nspontaneously emerging after coinfection with two \nMVM strains, and (iii) a collection of MVM mutants \naffected at the capsid domain recognizing sialic \nacid receptors that were obtained from directed \nevolution strategies (Figure 1B).\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/jmalmendral Group Members\nPrincipal Investigators:\nJos\u00e9 M.

DNA transfer and repair is enhanced \nin thermal environments due to the strong selective \nfactor appointed by high temperatures against \nreplication fidelity that results in the selection of \nsmall genomes. For Thermus thermophilus (Tth), this \nselection has leaded to the evolution of a polyploid \ngenome and the most efficient natural competence \napparatus (NCA) so far described. In addition, Tth \ncan exchange DNA by direct cell contacts using \n\u201ctransjugation\u201d, a process in which a DNA donation \napparatus (DDA) allows the ejection of DNA from a \n\u201cdonor\u201d strain with the concomitant incorporation \nby a competent recipient mate through its NCA. \nThe main focus of our research in the last two years \nhas been the analysis of the mechanisms involved in \nprotection against the integration of environmental \nDNA (eDNA) in the genome. In this context we have \nstudied the role of a DNA primase-polymerase \n(Ppol) encoded by mobile element ICETh2, as anti-\neDNA barrier. We found that Ppol loss of function \nmutations increase dramatically the transformability \nof the cells with eDNA by 2-3 orders of magnitude, \nplaying apparently a defensive role that is not \nactive against DNA transferred by a mating pair in transjugation. This differential protective activity is \nsimilar to that provided by ThAgo, a homologue of \nthe human Argonaute protein that uses DNA-DNA \ninterference to cleave exogenous DNA entering the \ncells by transformation, suggesting a role for Ppol \nas putative generator of ssDNA guides for ThAgo. \nFurther work of our group has shown the relevance \nof Ppol for plasmid stability and the existence of \nPpol-independent mechanisms for the generation \nof ssDNA guides for ThAgo. Our most recent work \nhas shown a deep imbrication of Ppol in DNA repair \nin Tth, keeping an unexpected equilibrium between \nits activity and that of the excinuclease AddAB, \nrequired to generate the 3\u2019 overhands needed to \nrepair dsDNA breaks by homologous recombination. \nIn such equilibrium Ppol compensates for an \napparently lethal overactivity of AddAB, in such \na way that only addAB  loss-of-function mutants \nsurvive to the inactivation of Ppol. Future work \nof the group will focus on the relation of HGT and \nrecombination pathways and use this knowledge \nto develop new tools for the directed evolution of \nproteins in Tth.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigators \n(PI, co-PI): \nJos\u00e9 Berenguer Carlos\nMario Menc\u00eda Caballero\nScientific Staff:\nAlba Blesa Esteban\nPostdoctoral fellows:\nPatricia P\u00e9rez Arnaiz   \n(from September 2021)\nPredoctoral fellows:\nCarlos Verd\u00fa Cano\nTechnicians:\nVirginia Garc\u00eda-Calvo  \n(from September 2021 until \nMarch 2022)\nMarta Failde SolerAlvaro Villamayor Arribas\nCristina G\u00f3mez Campo  \n(from October 2022)\nUndergraduate and \nMaster Students:\nIv\u00e1n Mu\u00f1oz Cabello de \nAlba \nAna Varad\u00e9 Hern\u00e1n\nEva Pastor Alacreu\nCristina G\u00f3mez Campo\nVisiting scientists:\nAli Abdelmoteleb \nAbdelaziem Abdallah \nGera\nIsabel Mart\u00ednez Ferrandohttp://www.cbm.uam.es/jberenguerBIOTECHNOLOGY AND GENETICS OF EXTREME THERMOPHILES209\nMicrobes in Health and Welfare Unit\n CBM 2021-2022Model for the in vivo interplay between Primpol and AddAB.

Our previous work with HCV documented \nsynergies between nucleoside analogues, partly due \nto their difference preference for mutation sites. This \nencouraged the search for synergistic treatments \nfor COVID-19. To this aim, we have designed stricter \nevaluation protocols, particularly use of high fitness virus \nand antiviral administration once the infection is ongoing.\nWe carry our work in collaboration with the group \nof Celia Perales (CNB-CSIC) who is associated with \nFundaci\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez D\u00edaz, an institution that advises us \nregarding COVID-19 patient monitoring, and provides \nus with well characterized virus isolates. Thanks to such  \ncollaboration, and that of experts on bioinformatics, we \nhave quantified the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, \nwith high resolution. Virus from patients who developed \nmild disease may be the source of more variants than \nvirus from patients who suffered severe disease. These \nstudies are carried out in collaboration also with the \ngroups of Nuria Verdaguer (IBMB, Barcelona, as part of \nour participation in the platform PTI Salud Global from \nCSIC) and Jordi G\u00f3mez (Instituto L\u00f3pez Neyra, CSIC, \nGranada, with a joint Plan Nacional project).Jointly with the groups of Soledad Delgado (UPM), \nFederico Mor\u00e1n (UCM) and Cecilio L\u00f3pez-Gal\u00edndez (ISCIII) \nwe are currently applying artificial intelligence methods \n(derivation of self-organized neural network maps) \nto quantify haplotypes in viral populations and their \nmodifications. Our hypothesis is that detailed information \non genetic variation dynamics will help us to find more \neffective treatments.\nWe participate in additional collaborations with other \nteams, and we have been asked to write review articles on \nviral quasispecies, as shown in the publication list. \nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/edomingoGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator: \nEsteban Domingo Solans \nScientific Staff: \nCelia Perales Viejo\nPostdoctoral fellows: \nPilar Somovilla Crespo  \n(since January 2022)\nPredoctoral fellows: \nCarlos Garc\u00eda Crespo\nVictoria Castro Illana   \n(until July 2021)\nBrenda Mart\u00ednez Gonz\u00e1lez\nRebeca Lobo Vega   \n(until June 2021)\nTechnicians: \nAna Isabel de \u00c1vila Lucas\nIsabel Gallego Jim\u00e9nez \n(until December 2021)\nMar\u00eda Eugenia Soria BenitoUndergraduate and \nMaster Students: \nMiriam Herr\u00e1ez Moncus\u00ed \n(until June 2021)\nAntoni Dur\u00e1n i Pastor \n(since September 2021)\nLuc\u00eda V\u00e1zquez Sirvent \n(until April 2022)\nVisiting scientists: \nAna Grande P\u00e9rez,\nUniversidad de M\u00e1laga  \n(February-June 2022)\nJosep Sardanyes, Centre \nde Recerca Matem\u00e0tica \n(November 2022).GENETIC VARIABILITY OF RNA VIRUSES\nDoctoral theses\n \u00bbVictoria Castro Illana (2021).

We try to connect the generation \nof knowledge to the development of biotechnological \napplications. Basically, we focus on the characterization \nof enzymes producing new compounds, the analysis \nof their structural-functional determinants, their \noperational improvement using molecular biology tools, \nthe characterization of the new molecules produced and \nthe evaluation of their potential biological activity.\nDuring the last years we have continued with the \ncharacterization and study of proteins from non-\nconventional yeast showing glycosyltransferase \nactivity, applicable in the production of new \nheterooligosaccharides and glycoconjugate derivatives \nwith putative prebiotic or antioxidant properties. We \nhave also characterized new fungal chitinases that can \nhydrolyze different chitinolytic materials, waste from \nthe industrial activity, to generate chitooligosaccharides \nwith promising bioactive properties. In general, most \nof the characterized proteins are glycosyl hydrolases \n(GH) structurally included in families GH32, 31, 13 or 18. \nRecently we have found that some of the characterized \nenzymes can glycosylate compounds with aromatic \nrings such as hydroxytyrosol or phloretin, which gives \nthem a special biotechnological interest. We have \nobtained numerous variants of enzymes that increase \nor alter the pattern of biosynthetic products.

(2013) Structure and Physics of Viruses , \nSpringer 2013; new edition under way). Based on \nthese studies, we aim at providing novel insights \ninto key processes for viral infection, including virus \nmorphogenesis, structural rearrangements and \nuncoating; and to provide guidelines and proof of \nconcept for the application of this knowledge for \nthe design of vaccines, antiviral drugs, biomaterials \nor modified nanoparticles for biomedical or \nbionanotechnological uses (see Mateu (2016). In \nProtein-based Engineered Nanostructures , Springer \n2016, pp.83-120).\nScientific relevance and technological implications: \nSome major scientific contributions in the last years \ninclude: i) experimental evidence on the biological \nrelevance of mechanical properties of viruses; ii) \ninsights into the intimate relationship between \nvirus mechanical elasticity and conformational \ndynamics at equilibrium; iii) detailed descriptions \nof virus capsid self-assembly routes, including the \nactual visualization in real time using high-speed atomic force microscopy of single molecules during \ncapsid lattice assembly; iv) the discovery of the \npossibility to develop new antiviral drugs acting on \nthe mechanical properties of viral particles; v) the \ngenetic design of novel biomaterials with improved \nmechanical properties. \nSome specific subjects that are currently being \nresearched in our laboratory include: i) the \nrelationship between the mechanics and dynamics \nof a virus capsid and virus assembly or genome \nuncoating; ii) the structural determinants of the \nmechanical properties of viruses; iii) the biological \nrelevance of the mechanical properties of viruses; \niv) the development of new antiviral drugs that \nmodify the mechanical properties of viruses, and of \nmechanically resistant virus-based nanostructured \nmaterials.http://www.cbm.uam.es/mgmateuGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator: \nMauricio G.

The synergy between new \nexperimental discovery tools based on biology and \nthose based on nanotechnologies are instrumental \nto find relevant genes faster and more efficiently, \nparticularly enabling academic labs to undertake \nscreening campaigns until now costly and limited to \nlarge enterprises.\nIn the HT Discovery lab, we develop methods to \ndiscover and engineer industrially relevant enzymes \nand biosynthetic gene clusters in the natural or \nartificial genetic diversity. One of the tools to discover \nnew or improved enzymes are biological selections: \ninexpensive methods to find enzymes that couple \nthe improved fitness of a protein to the survival of \na biological host under selective pressure. In our \ngroup, we develop and apply biological selections \nto enhance the activity of enzymes with \u201cunnatural\u201d \nsubstrates relevant for the pharma and fine \nchemical industries and the stability of enzymes to \nwithstand harsh conditions of industrial processes, \nsuch as the presence of organic cosolvents or \nhigh temperatures. Using such methods, we have \ndeveloped selective and stable transferases in the \nframe of regional and national research grants. \nSubsequently, after suitable enzymes are found, we \nstudy the underlying rationale for their improved \nfitness, often using bioinformatic approaches, thus uncovering how and why enzymes function and \nultimately, learning the language of proteins.\nHowever, the complexity of cellular metabolism \nlimits the applicability of biological selections. For \nthis reason, we also work on screening methods, \nwhich involve individual enzymatic assays in vitro of \neach enzyme variant generated. To shorten this long, \ntedious and expensive process, droplet microfluidics \nenables the miniaturization of assays with throughput \nof kHz rates as well as a 1000x reduction of volume \nand assay costs. Moreover, microfluidics enables \nthe conversion of general lab operations (additions, \naliquoting, detection of a given property) into a \nparticular chip design. Using ultrahigh-throughput \nscreening, we have developed screening methods for \nesterases, KREDs, lyases and other enzymes in the EU-\nfunded projects MetaFluidics, RadicalZ and CC-TOP.  \nThe enzymes discovered using these methods are not \nonly located in unexplored regions of sequence space, \nbut sometimes exhibited much coveted properties for \nsubsequent engineering, such as catalytic promiscuity.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigators \nAurelio Hidalgo\nSCIENTIFIC STAFF:\nPostdoctoral fellows\nSandra Bosch (from 5/2021)\nDavide Cecchini\nMar\u00eda Gimeno (from 1/2021)\nDiana Mat\u00e9  (until 12/2021)\nMercedes S\u00e1nchez   \n(until 2/2021)\nPredoctoral fellows\nLaura Blas  (from 10/2021)\nSandra Bosch (until 4/2021)\nJorge Bravo  (until 5/2021)\nJohn Mart\u00ednez  \n(from 10/2021)Technicians\nCarmen Ortega\nJorge Mart\u00ednez (from \n2/2022, w/ Jos\u00e9 Almendral & \nAlberto L\u00f3pez-Bueno)\nUndergraduate and \nMaster Students \nLaura Blas (until 9/2021)\nAndr\u00e9s Hernando   \n(until 6/2021)\nIsabel Mart\u00edn  \n(until 6/2021)ULTRAHIGH-THROUGHPUT DISCOVERY AND ENGINEERING \nOF ENZYMES FOR BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS \nwww.cbm.uam.es/ahidalgo\nResearch Networks\n \u00bbRed Nacional de Microorganismos Extrem\u00f3filos.219\nMicrobes in Health and Welfare Unit\n CBM 2021-2022Participation in projects\n \u00bbInnovative tools for sustainable exploration of marine \nmicrobiome innovative tools for sustainable exploration \nof marine microbiomes: towards a circular blue \nbioeconomy and healthier marine environments (HE-\nCL6, GA 101081957, BlueTools).

DOI: 10.1007/978-1-0716-1826-4_2220\nInteractions with the Environment CBM 2021-2022\nSummary\nBacterial conjugation is the process by which a \nconjugative DNA element is transferred from a \ndonor to a recipient cell via a connecting channel. \nConjugative elements are often located on plasmids, \nnamed conjugative plasmids. Besides containing \nall genes necessary for conjugation, conjugative \nelements often contain antibiotic resistance \ngenes, and conjugation is the main horizontal \ngene transfer route responsible for the spread of \nantibiotic resistance (AR) genes, which is a serious \nproblem worldwide. Very little is known about \nconjugation in Gram-positive (G+) bacteria. Despite \nof its notorious role in AR, there is also a positive \nside: conjugative plasmids can be used to generate \ntools to genetically modify bacteria that are relevant \nin industrial, clinical and scientific settings that are \nreluctant to modification by other methods. \nThe two main objectives in our lab are developing \ntools to modify G+ bacteria and studying different \nstages of the conjugation process. The final goal is to \nuse this information to generate drugs or strategies \nto impede conjugation [long-term strategy]. Most of \nour studies are based on multidisciplinary research \ninvolving collaborations with other groups that \ncontribute with specific expertise. Bioinformatics \nplays a crucial role in all our research lines. Recently, \nwe have found that pLS20 is the prototype of a \nfamily of related plasmids that can be divided into \nfour clades. This finding is important because it \npermits us to identify conserved genes/features and protein domains/motifs. Another goal of our \ninvestigations is to provide the scientific community \nwith tools allowing genetic modification of relevant \nG+ bacteria. We have developed a system, based \non the pLS20 conjugation machinery, allowing \nthe exchange of chromosomal regions of >100 kb \nbetween strains. Another goal is to gain insights into \nthe different stages of the conjugation process that \nmay lead to ways to impede conjugation-mediated \nspread of AR.  Results obtained in the last years have \nshown that the scientific significance of our research \nis much wider than these goals, which is illustrated \nby the following two examples. First, by studying \nthe regulatory circuitry controlling expression of \nthe conjugation genes we have identified a novel \ntwo-component processive antitermination system \nthat is present on almost all conjugation operons \nin G+ bacteria. Second, by studying how donor \ncells contact recipient cells we discovered that they \nachieve this by a special adhesin allowing covalent \nattachment between the two cells. \nParticipation in projects\n \u00bbStudy of proteins involved in different aspects of the \nconjugation process of the Bacillus subtilis  plasmid pLS20. \nPID2019-108778GB-C21P.

Despite significant advances in \nantiretroviral therapy, HIV still causes around 650,000 \ndeaths each year. The HIV genome is composed of \ntwo copies of single-stranded RNA. The viral reverse \ntranscriptase (RT) is responsible for the replication of \nthe HIV genome. RT inhibitors constitute the backbone \nof current antiretroviral therapies.\nFor years, our efforts have been directed towards \nthe elucidation of molecular mechanisms involved in \nRT inhibitor resistance; and understanding the role \nof different amino acids in nucleotide specificity and \nfidelity of DNA synthesis of retroviral RTs. We have \nengineered HIV-1 RT variants with increased thermal \nstability and DNA polymerization accuracy, currently \nmarketed as biotechnological tools. Present and future \nresearch in our lab focuses on obtaining novel RTs with \nincreased accuracy of DNA synthesis and high nucleic \nacid binding affinity, suitable for RNA amplification \nfrom single cells. \nNucleoside analog RT inhibitors (NRTIs) play a \ncentral role in antiretroviral therapy. However, HIV \ntype 1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2) differ in their \nmutational pathways of NRTI resistance. Unlike in HIV-\n1 RT, thymidine analogue resistance mutations (TAMs) \nsuch as M41L, D67N, K70R and S215Y do not confer \nresistance to AZT and other NRTIs when found in HIV-\n2, due to amino acid differences located in the fingers \nsubdomain of its RT. We have recently demonstrated \nthat the accumulation of TAMs in HIV-2 RT renders an \nenzyme with defective strand displacement activity. Despite remarkable advances in antiretroviral therapy, \nprevalence of drug-resistant HIV strains is increasing \naround the World, particularly in less-developed \ncountries. The search for unexploited targets of \nantiretroviral intervention is important for the future \nclinical management of the disease. To address coming \nchallenges in antiretroviral research, we are extending \nour biochemical studies to other catalytic activities \nof the RT (e.g. ribonuclease H). Collaborations with \nmedicinal chemists have been established to identify \npotentially useful RNase H inhibitors. These drugs, \nspecific for HIV-1 and HIV-2, could also be developed \ninto broader spectrum inhibitors blocking infection of \nother viruses (e.g. hepatitis B virus, herpesviruses). \nResearch in our laboratory has also highlighted the role \nof the HIV-1 RT\u2019s RNase H activity in template switching \nand strand displacement during reverse transcription. \nWe have recently shown that dual inhibitors of the \nDNA polymerase and RNase H activities of HIV-1 RT are \nparticularly effective in blocking strand displacement \nDNA synthesis when RNA was used as template.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator: \nLuis Men\u00e9ndez Arias\nPostdoctoral fellows:  \nEstrella Frutos Beltr\u00e1n \nPredoctoral fellows:  \nSamara Mart\u00edn Alonso \nJavier Mart\u00ednez del R\u00edo \nTechnicians\nNerea L\u00f3pez Carrobles \n(since May 2021)Undergraduate and \nMaster students:  \nAdri\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez \n(until January 2021) \nDavid Borrego Garc\u00eda  \n(until May 2021)\nMiruna A.

Since the rise of antimicrobial \nresistance is making infections harder to treat, with \nspecial emphasis to those caused by Gram-negative \nbacteria due to their extra outer membrane barrier, it \nis crucial to understand how the cell envelope integrity \nis maintained during the bacterial cell cycle. The cell \nenvelope integrity is essential for the physiology \nand pathogenicity of bacteria, and therefore both \npeptidoglycan and membrane synthesis machineries \nare coordinated and regulated to ensure the robust \ngrowth of the cell envelope.\nContrary to cell elongation and cell division, which \nhave been studied in greater depth, the transition \nbetween both stages called preseptal growth \nremains poorly characterized. This switch involves \nthe incorporation of new PG material at mid-cell \nbefore the septum is formed. In previous work we \ndescribed the connection between the cytosolic FtsZ polymers and the PG synthases (PBP1A and PBP1B) \nthrough the partially redundant proteins ZipA and \nFtsA-FtsN. The disruption of both connections \ndisables the incorporation of new preseptal PG, \nleading to non-viable filamented cells, identifying \nthe preseptal PG growth as an essential process \noccurring prior cell division (Pazos et al. 2018, Nat \nCommun 9:5090). These results would answer the \nlong-standing question about the mechanism by \nwhich single-point mutations in FtsA are able to \nbypass the requirement of ZipA for cell division and \npreseptal PG synthesis.\nIn addition, we described for the first time how \nthe PG-binding SPOR proteins DamX and DedD are \nrequired for full functionality of the PG synthases \nPBP1A and PBP1B, and the lethal effect of an \nunbalanced DedD:DamX protein ratio (Pazos et al. \n2020, mBio 11:e02796-20). SPOR domains are widely \nspread and conserved in bacterial proteins, making \nthem promising target to interfere with bacterial \ncell envelope synthesis.\nTo accomplish our ultimate goal of identifying new \npotential antimicrobial targets, we aim to use a \nmultidisciplinary approach combining genetics, \nbiochemistry, cell biology and different microscopy \ntechniques to characterize the molecular components \nand cell envelope features during this potentially \nvulnerable stage of the bacterial cell cycle.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator\nManuel Pazos\nTechnician\nDaniel Ballesteros  (from Nov. 2022)\nUndergraduate\nPaula de la Fuente  (from Oct. 2022)\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/mpazosBACTERIAL CELL ENVELOPE DURING PRESEPTAL GROWTH 225\nMicrobes in Health and Welfare Unit\n CBM 2021-2022List of publications\nArticles with CBM-UAM affiliation:\n \u00bbMamou, G., Corona, F., Cohen-Khait, R., Housden, N.G., \nYeung, V., Sun, D., Sridhar, P., Pazos, M., Knowles, T.J., \nKleanthous, C. and Vollmer, W., (2022) Peptidoglycan \nmaturation controls outer membrane protein assembly. \nNature. 606, 953-959. doi: 10.1038/s41586-022-04834-7.\nArticles without CBM-UAM affiliation:\n \u00bbWacnik, K., Rao, V.A., Chen, X., Lafage, L., Pazos, M., Booth, \nS., Vollmer, W., Hobbs, J.K., Lewis, R.J. and Foster S.J.

L. monocytogenes exhibits an outstanding \ncapacity to tolerate widely used practices in the \nfood industry that control microbial growth in food, \nincluding refrigeration. Our main objective is to \nunderstand the regulatory mechanisms and the \nadaptive strategies that allow L. monocytogenes  to \ngrow at refrigeration temperatures (0-4\u00baC).   \nDuring these last two years, our experimental \napproach has relied on systems-level approaches \nto identify transcriptional and post-transcriptional \nregulatory networks at 4\u00baC. We performed \ntranscriptomics analyses along the acclimation \nfrom 37\u00baC to 4\u00baC, which showed the participation \nof transcriptional regulators and small non-coding \nregulatory RNAs (sRNAs) in two defined phases catalogued as early and late responses (Fig. 1A \nB). We are currently characterizing the precise \nfunctional role of these regulators in cold adaptation \nand, in addition, focusing on cell wall proteome \nchanges occurring specifically at 4\u00baC. The available \ndata indicate that at least two surface proteins are \nproduced only in cold. The next studies are designed \nto investigate the contribution of these proteins \nto the adaptive response and to characterize the \nmechanisms that control their expression. \nWe expect that the understanding of the regulatory \nmechanisms governing the L. monocytogenes \ncapacity to tolerate cold temperature will provide \nthe field with novel targets useful to prevent \nits growth in refrigerated food. These new \nantimicrobial preventive practices during food \nprocessing and storage will ultimately reduce the \nrisk of L. monocytogenes  infections in both humans \nand livestock.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator (PI): \nM.

African swine fever virus (ASFV) \nis one of the most complex DNA viruses due to \nits large genome, encoding between 150 and 170 \ngenes, which are involved in multiple functions, \nsuch as evasion of the host immune response. ASFV \nis the causative agent of African swine fever (ASF), \none of the most lethal diseases affecting domestic \npigs and wild boar, which is seriously endangering \nthe global swine industry due to its quick and \nuncontrolled spread. \nInterferons (IFN) are cytokines playing a key role \nagainst infections, and the early induction of IFN-I, \nis a central event of the innate immune defense \nagainst viruses. Specifically, type I IFNs are involved \nin induction of antimicrobial state both in infected \nand neighboring cells, activating the innate immune \nresponse and leading to the adaptive immune \nresponse. Our recent work has established the \ndifferent ability to control the host IFN-\u03b2 production \nas a key element for virulence. Differences in \nvirulence among different ASFV strains have been \nrelated to their ability to counteract the innate \nimmune response, specifically, in the control of \nIFN-I. We have described that virulent ASFV inhibit both the cGAS/STING and the IFN-I-induced JAK/\nSTAT pathways, thus controlling the production of \nIFN-I and its dependent genes.\nInactivated and subunit ASFV-vaccines have failed \nto confer effective protection to vaccinated animals, \nas it seems like that viral replication is needed. The \ngeneration of live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) is \ncurrently the most promising strategy, through the \nattenuation of ASFV strains by genetic manipulation. \nFor the generation of effective and safe LAVs, it is \nnecessary to identify the molecular determinants of \nASFV virulence. \nOur group has generated several LAVs prototypes \nfrom the Arm/07/CBM/c2 genotype II strain, by \ndeleting genes previously shown to have a role in \nvirulence. As an example of that, we have specifically \ndeleted the EP402R (CD2v) and A238L genes by an \u201cin \nhouse\u201d CRISPR/Cas9 adapted-technology in COS-1 \ncells, without detectable further genetic changes. \nThe successful immunization of pigs has proven this \nvaccine to be safe and fully protective against the \ncirculating Korean Paju genotype II strain, opening \nthe possibility of a new vaccine on the market in the \nnear future.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator:\nYolanda Revilla Novella\nPostdoctoral:  \nDaniel P\u00e9rez N\u00fa\u00f1ez\nCarmen S\u00e1nchez \nValdepe\u00f1as\nPredoctoral:\nRaquel Garc\u00eda Belmonte\nElena Riera Laguna\nGonzalo Vigara Astillero\nJulia Gata de BenitoTechnician:\nCecilia Flores \nUndergraduate and \nMaster Students\nMarta Hern\u00e1ndez-\nFern\u00e1ndez Sesma \nVisiting scientists:\nRoberta PireddaVIRUS-CELL INTERACTION AND VACCINES DEVELOPMENT: \nTHE ASFV MODEL\nhttp://www.cbm.uam.es/yrevilla229\nMicrobes in Health and Welfare Unit\n CBM 2021-2022List of publications\n \u00bbRecombinant African Swine Fever Virus Arm/07/CBM/\nc2 Lacking CD2v and A238L Is Attenuated and Protects \nPigs against Virulent Korean Paju Strain.

We use foot-and-mouth disease \nvirus (FMDV), a highly infectious and worldwide \ndistributed pathogen, as a model. Our studies \ninclude the identification of proteins involved \nin detection of the viral RNA genome, as well \nas the characterization of the immune evasion \nmechanisms exerted by the virus to counteract \nthe host antiviral response based on triggering \nof the type-I interferon pathway in infected cells. \nThe outcome of the balance between the antiviral \nresponse and viral antagonism may determine \nthe onset of disease and pathogenesis and we are \nactively working on the identification of host innate \neffector proteins which are targets for the viral \nproteases. We have reported a novel mechanism of \nviral evasion based on the dual cleavage of LGP2 and \nMDA5, immune sensors of the RIG-I-like receptors \nfamily, at a conserved helicase motif by the FMDV \nLeader protease (Lpro). The proteolytic activity of \nthe two virally encoded proteases (Lpro and 3Cpro) \nis being tested for interference with different \nsignaling routes known to respond to infection by \nRNA viruses (RIG-I-like receptors, Toll -like receptors, \ncGAS/STING, RNA interference). The impact of \nthese interactions on viral infection and antiviral \nimmunity is under study; ii) the biotherapeutic \napplications of synthetic non-coding RNAs derived from the FMDV genome (ncRNAs), known to induce \na broad spectrum antiviral activity and to enhance \nspecific B- and T-cell mediated immune responses \nelicited after vaccination. We have reported the \ninhibitory effect of the ncRNAs against infection \nby pathogens of different viral families including \nrelevant zoonotic viruses (FMDV, West Nile virus, \nRift Valley fever virus, African swine fever virus) and \nshown their biological activity in cells from different \nspecies including farm and wild animals, as well as \nin vivo in mice and swine. The use of these ncRNAs \nagainst human coronaviruses has been addressed \nshowing the intrinsic prophylactic activity of naked \nRNA against SARS-CoV-2 in a COVID-19 mouse \nmodel. We are also working on the development \nof new nanotechnology-based formulations to \nimprove stability and efficacy in RNA delivery. The \nresults derived from these studies will contribute \nto gain knowledge on the interaction between \nviral pathogens and the innate immune system of \nthe host cell and to design new and more effective \nstrategies against current and newly emerging \nviruses.\nGroup Members\nPrincipal Investigator\nMargarita S\u00e1iz Zalabardo\nScientific Staff\nMiguel \u00c1ngel Sanz Hern\u00e1ndez \nPostdoctoral Fellow\nMiguel Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez Pulido\nPredoctoral Fellow\nMiryam Polo Hern\u00e1ndez\nUndergraduate Student\nLuc\u00eda Camacho Pulido (until 30/06/21)MODULATION OF ANTIVIRAL IMMUNITY BY VIRAL PROTEASES \nAND NONCODING RNAS\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/msaiz231\nMicrobes in Health and Welfare Unit\n CBM 2021-2022List of publications\n \u00bbSaiz, M. and Martinez-Salas, E.

CSIC232\nInteractions with the Environment CBM 2021-2022\nSummary\nDevelopment of new, effective vaccines and \nantivirals are key aspects for animal and human \nhealth control. Foot-and-mouth disease virus \n(FMDV) is one of the major concerns for animal \nhealth. It is also an interesting model system for \nunderstanding the interactions of a highly variable \nRNA virus and its natural hosts and the implications \nof these interactions on disease control with clear \nconnections with the \u201cOne Health\u201d approach. We are \nworking in the development of new FMDV peptide \nmarker vaccines that can induce protective humoral \nand cellular immune responses, using pig and cattle, \nimportant domestics hosts, as animal models. In \nparticular, we are further understanding the role \nof different FMDV epitopes in evoking protective \nresponses, whose main known effectors are specific \nneutralizing antibodies, and using this information \nto optimize dendrimer peptide constructions \ndisplaying different arrangements of FMDV B- and \nT- cell epitopes as feasible field vaccines. We have \nalso analyzed the functional role of FMDV proteins \non the viral particle stability and internalization, the \nreplication cycle and the mechanisms mediating the \npathogenesis of FMDV and other related viruses \ncausing vesicular diseases, such as swine vesicular \ndisease virus (SVDV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) \nand a zoonotic virus such as West Nile virus. As part \nof these studies, we have characterized the inhibitory \neffect of antivirals targeting cellular metabolism such as valproic acid (VPA), lauryl gallate (LG) and \ncerulenin (CRL) on the multiplication of FMDV, SVDV, \nas well as different enveloped viruses, like African \nswine fever virus (ASFV), VSV, type I herpesvirus and \nhuman coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. \nThe expertise of our group is being applied to \naddress the potential of the modular approach \nbased on dendrimer peptides vaccines against \nSARS-CoV-2. In addition, the antiviral synergy \nagainst different coronaviruses, and eventually \nother emerging viruses, of combinations of broad \nantiviral spectrum host-targeted compounds \nsuch as VPA or LG and direct acting antivirals (i.e. \nremdesivir) is under study. \nGroup Members\nGroup Leader (IP)   \nFrancisco Sobrino\nPostdoctoral fellows    \nPatricia de Le\u00f3n\nTechnicians     \nMar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Bustos \nLaura CerradaNEW STRATEGIES FOR PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF VIRAL \nDISEASES: FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE VIRUS AS A MODEL\nhttps://www.cbm.uam.es/fsobrino\nPatents\n \u00bbPatent Pending: EP21382535.9 (17-06-2021).

The first one, in collaboration with \nBalbino Alarc\u00f3n's group, consisted in the computational \ndesign and experimental validation of antibodies against \nthe SARS-CoV2 Spike protein, and it generated a highly \nefficient method for detecting specific antibodies against \nSpike protein in blood serum, which was patented and \nlicensed. The second one, in collaboration with Ugo \nBastolla, Manuel Fresno and Laura Garc\u00eda-Bermejo from \nthe Ramon y Cajal hospital, investigated the relationship \nbetween ACE2 levels in the blood of patients and the \nseverity of symptoms of SARS-CoV2 infection. The third \nproject, in collaboration with the CNB-CBMSO transgene \nfacility, was an in silico study for humanizing the mouse \nACE2 receptor using the CRISPR technique in order to \ngenerate a murine model of Covid-19.Description\nThe mission of the Bioinformatics Facility is to support \nresearch groups of the CBMSO (and occasionally other \ncentres) in the bioinformatics analysis of their data, to \norient their research through computational predictions \nand to advice on the computational aspects of their \nprojects. The personnel in the Facility teach at master\u2019s \ncourses and participate in bioinformatics training of \nmaster students. Nowadays, bioinformatics analyses and \npredictions must complement experiments in order to \nrationalize their results and to maximize the knowledge \nthat they provide. This is particularly true for high \nthroughput experiments, whose bioinformatics analysis \nis necessary for extracting the information of interest. \nIn addition, in silico predictions may help optimizing the \ndesign of the experiments. We perform these analyses \nand predictions through computer programs that are \npublicly available or we develop specific programs to \ntackle specific problems, and we run the computations in \nthe computing infrastructure of the Bioinformatics Facility, \nwhich consists of a high performance computing cluster, \nwith infiniband connection, a shared parallel file system \nand computational nodes with up to 512GB of memory and \n60 CPU cores.Group Members\nTechnical Director: \nDavid Abia Holgado\nScientific Supervisor: \nUgo Bastolla Bufalini\nList of publications\nThe bioinformatics service staff has participated in 12 scientific \npublications between 2021-2022.
