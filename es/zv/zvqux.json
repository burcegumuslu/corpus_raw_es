On July 18,\n[CDPHE variant tracking](https://covid19.colorado.gov/data) indicated that the Delta variant is responsible for more than 95% of new COVID-19 cases in Colorado.\nAs the COVID-19\n[landscape evolves with the Delta variant](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html), BCPH is monitoring cases, testing, outbreaks, hospitalizations, deaths and other metrics as well as working closely with CDPHE, our healthcare partners and monitoring [CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/guidance.html) and [CDC metrics](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home).\nBCPH\u2019s goals are to prevent unnecessary deaths and significant illness, particularly as we see more information regarding the high rate of long-term symptoms in COVID-19 patients, and to preserve our healthcare system capacity.\nAs Public Health Order 2021-4 sunsets on Aug. 15 at 11:59 p.m., the county will no longer look only at hospital admissions to dictate levels on the prior state dial. BCPH is actively working to define a robust set of metrics that will have indicators that match the transmission landscape set by Delta.\n\u201cPreviously, hospital admissions dictated the dial, but given that the Delta variant is quickly changing conditions, we must look at the evolving data and information concerning Delta to formulate the best strategies to safely keep our community open,\u201d Rodriguez added.\nBCPH encourages everyone eligible (12+) to\n[get a vaccine](https://bouldercounty.gov/families/disease/covid-19/vaccines/) as soon as possible since vaccines are effective at fighting variants, and strongly recommends wearing a face covering while indoors.\nConcerns about the Delta variant\n- The Delta variant is the predominant strain in Colorado\n- The Delta variant is two to three times more transmissible than the strain circulating last summer\n- On average, people infected with the Delta variant had 1,000 times more copies of the virus in respiratory tract as compared to those with other strains\n- Someone catching the Delta variant is more likely to become infectious sooner and spreading the virus earlier in the course of the infection\n[CDPHE tracks variant data information](https://covid19.colorado.gov/data)\nCondado de Boulder, CO - Debido a que la variante Delta est\u00e1 causando un aumento en los casos de COVID-19, Salud P\u00fablica del Condado de Boulder recomienda encarecidamente que todas las personas de m\u00e1s de 2 a\u00f1os usen m\u00e1scaras en todos los lugares interiores, independientemente del estado de vacunaci\u00f3n.\nEl 11 de agosto, solo 16 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de pasar a una transmisi\u00f3n sustancial el 26 de julio, el Condado de Boulder se traslad\u00f3 a una transmisi\u00f3n alta, que es el nivel m\u00e1s alto de transmisi\u00f3n de COVID-19 bajo el\n[rastreador de transmisi\u00f3n](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view) de los Centros para el Control y la Prevenci\u00f3n de Enfermedades (CDC, por sus siglas en ingles).

El 18 de julio, el\n[seguimiento de variantes de CDPHE](https://covid19.colorado.gov/data) indic\u00f3 que la variante Delta es responsable de m\u00e1s del 95% de los nuevos casos de COVID-19 en el estado.\nA medida que el panorama de COVID-19\n[evoluciona con la variante Delta,](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html) Salud Publica est\u00e1 monitoreando casos, pruebas, brotes, hospitalizaciones, muertes y otras m\u00e9tricas, as\u00ed como trabajando en estrecha colaboraci\u00f3n con CDPHE, nuestros socios de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica y monitoreando la [ gu\u00eda de CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/guidance.html) y las [m\u00e9tricas de CDC.](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home)\nLos objetivos de Salud P\u00fablica siguen siendo prevenir muertes innecesarias y enfermedades significativas, particularmente la alta tasa de s\u00edntomas a largo plazo en pacientes de COVID-19, y preservar la capacidad de nuestro sistema de salud.\nLa Orden de Salud P\u00fablica 2021-4 se expirar\u00e1 el 15 de agosto a las 11:59 p.m. y el Condado ya no tomar\u00e1 en cuenta solo las admisiones hospitalarias para dictar los niveles en el indicador estatal anterior. BCPH est\u00e1 trabajando activamente para definir un conjunto s\u00f3lido de m\u00e9tricas que tendr\u00e1n indicadores que coincidan con el panorama de transmisi\u00f3n establecido por Delta.\n\"Anteriormente, los ingresos hospitalarios dictaban el indicador, pero dado que la variante Delta est\u00e1 cambiando r\u00e1pidamente las condiciones, debemos ver los datos y la informaci\u00f3n en evoluci\u00f3n sobre Delta para formular las mejores estrategias para mantener abierta de manera segura a nuestra comunidad\", agreg\u00f3 Rodr\u00edguez.\nSalud P\u00fablica alienta a todas las personas elegibles (12+) a\n[recibir una vacuna](https://bouldercounty.gov/families/disease/covid-19/vacunas/) lo antes posible, ya que las vacunas son efectivas para combatir las variantes, y se recomienda encarecidamente usar una cubierta facial mientras est\u00e1n en interiores.\nPreocupaciones sobre la variante Delta\n- La variante Delta es la cepa predominante en Colorado\n- La variante Delta es de dos a tres veces m\u00e1s transmisible que la cepa que circulo el verano pasado\n- En promedio, las personas infectadas con la variante Delta tienen 1,000 veces m\u00e1s copias del virus en las v\u00edas respiratorias en comparaci\u00f3n con aquellas con otras cepas\n- Alguien que contrae la variante Delta tiene m\u00e1s probabilidades de infectarse antes y propagar el virus antes en el curso de infecci\u00f3n\n[CDPHE realiza un seguimiento de la informaci\u00f3n de datos de variantes](https://covid19.colorado.gov/data)", "language": null, "image": null,
