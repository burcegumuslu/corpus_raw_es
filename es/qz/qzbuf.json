Morning prayers to the universe, your ancestors, your guiding spirits\nWe are all spiritual beings having a material experience. We are so much more than the terrible things that happen to us and so much more than what the systems of oppression, the oppressors and society tell us and reinforce about us. Reminding ourselves of our power, worthiness and our divinity can fortify us and the collective.\nPraise\nI give praise to the universe\nI give praise to mother earth\nI give praise to all of nature and its beings\nI give praise to all my guiding spirits\nI give praise to my ancestors\nI give praise to all that came before me in this struggle\nI give praise to my elders\nI give praise to all those who have cared for me, protected me, guided me and loved me\nI give praise to\u2026.(add any others you wish to give praise to)\nGratitude\nI thank you for allowing me to wake up this morning\nI thank you for my breath\nI thank you for my body\nI thank you for my journey\nI thank you for those who brought me into the world\nI thank you that all basic necessities are met on a daily basis\u2014(sunlight, water, the food on my table, the clothing on my back, my home, my mobility, my job\u2026.)\nI thank you for my family (you can name one by one if you wish)\nI thank you for my community (you can name then one by one if you wish)\nI thank you for my comrades (you can name them one by one if you wish)\nI thank you for my elders (you can name them one by one if you wish)\nI thank you for\u2026.(you can add anything else you are thankful for)\nForgiveness\nForgive us for the harm we do onto you (you can name the earth, the water, other beings, nature overall)\nForgive me for the harm I do to myself\nForgive us for the harm we do to one another\nProtection and Blessings\nProtect me (us) from death\nProtect me (us) from sickness\nProtect me (us) from litigation\nProtect me (us) from loss\nProtect me from the hands of \u2026.(add anything else you want to be protected from)\nI pray that for long life, good physical, spiritual and mental health\nI pray for a cool head and coolness in the world\nI pray for fortitude\nI pray for resiliency\nI pray for clarity\nI pray for courage\nI pray for a self-love\nI pray for\u2026.(add anything else you pray for including people)\n2. Libations\nLibations are an age-old practice by many indigenous peoples across the globe. It is the act of putting cool water or alcohol on the earth/ground to attract coolness into our spaces and to ourselves. Libations can be done before a ritual or conversation, whether at a protest or in your home, your office, a meeting, or other spaces that may be part of your daily life or community space or events.\nThe concept of \u201ccoolness\u201d\nWater is life, we are water and our world is water. Water is of major importance to all living things; in some organisms, up to 90% of their body weight comes from water. Up to 60% of the human adult body is water. The earth is 71% water. The concept of coolness is integral to the delicate balance of our planet, the rise of 1 to 2 degrees in temperature of the world\u2019s ocean that hold 95% of the earth\u2019s water has been catastrophic thus far (hurricanes, tsunamis, melting ice caps). Similarly, when we get \u201chot headed\u201d as individuals or loose our cool, we don\u2019t think clearly, we allow emotional challenges to take over such as anxiety, anger, frustration, self-doubt, etc. We must maintain our own coolness to think clearly, calmly and strategically and for our own wellbeing, that of the collective, and that of mother earth.\nDirections\nUse a small bowl and put half a cup of water in it. Ensure the water is room temperature or cold (do not use hot water) Dip your index finger into the water and drop a few drops of water onto the ground while chant the first phrase below \u201cMay the earth be cool\u201d. Repeat while you chant each one of the phrases that follow.\nMay mother earth be cool\nMay our guiding spirits be cool\nMay our ancestors be cool\nMay my (our) heads be cool\nYou could add:\nMay conversations be cool\nMy the day be cool\nMay our movement be cool\nMay my (our) comrades be cool\nMay those who want to harm me be cool\nMay this day be cool\nMay\u2026\u2026(add any other thing, situation, event, etc you want to bring coolness to)\nClose out the libation with call and response 3 times.\nYou say: May it be so!\nGroup responds: Surely shall it be!\nWritten by Francisca Porchas\nFrancisca Porchas has organized in working class communities of color and immigrant communities for 15 years.
