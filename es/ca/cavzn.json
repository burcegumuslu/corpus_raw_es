Curino, Presidente SAIC.\nEstimados integrantes de la comunidad de investigaci\u00f3n biom\u00e9dica.\nEs para m\u00ed un enorme placer darles la bienvenida a nuestra LXVI Reuni\u00f3n Anual que este a\u00f1o se realiza en \nforma conjunta con la Sociedad Argentina de Inmunolog\u00eda (SAI), la Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Farmacolog\u00eda \nExperimental (AAFE) y la Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Nanomedicinas (NANOMED).\nComo es tradici\u00f3n y como creo que corresponde, quisiera comenzar estas palabras realizando los agradeci -\nmientos pertinentes. Las actividades realizadas por la Sociedad Argentina de Investigaci\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica (SAIC) a \nlo largo del a\u00f1o y la organizaci\u00f3n de un congreso como este, ser\u00edan imposibles sin un verdadero trabajo en \nequipo. En este sentido quiero destacar y agradecer el trabajo de la Comisi\u00f3n y del Consejo Directivo. No \npuedo dejar de manifestar mi reconocimiento a algunas personas en particular.\nAl Dr. Alejandro Urtreger que ha desarrollado una enorme tarea de organizaci\u00f3n a lo largo del a\u00f1o en gene -\nral y para nuestra reuni\u00f3n anual en particular.\nA las Dras. Mariana Maccioni, Hebe Duran y Paula Schaiquevich, presidentas respectivamente de SAI, \nNanomed y AAFE, por la c\u00e1lida relaci\u00f3n y el buen trato con los que trabajamos en la organizaci\u00f3n de esta \nReuni\u00f3n Conjunta. Vaya para ellas y sus respectivas comisiones directivas todo mi agradecimiento.\nA los integrantes del grupo G2 y a nuestra secretaria Ivana por todo el trabajo realizado y por soportar con \npaciencia y buen humor mis cientos de llamados, emails y mensajes.\nA la Dra. Cristina Carrillo, presidenta 2020 de la SAIC, por haberme dado lugar para participar ampliamente \nen todas las actividades de la SAIC durante su mandato, lo que me permiti\u00f3 adquirir experiencia en la dif\u00edcil \norganizaci\u00f3n de la Sociedad en un a\u00f1o tan at\u00edpico. Esta experiencia fue una ayuda invalorable para la or -\nganizaci\u00f3n de la reuni\u00f3n anual de este a\u00f1o en la que, contra todo pron\u00f3stico, tambi\u00e9n tuvimos que trabajar \ncon las muchas limitaciones impuestas por la pandemia.\nAl Dr. Daniel Alonso, actual vicepresidente de SAIC, por ser una fuente permanente de consulta, intercambio \nde opiniones y consejos.\nCon Cristina y Daniel hemos coincidido en que SAIC debe tener funciones que van m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la orga -\nnizaci\u00f3n de la reuni\u00f3n anual. Pensamos que nuestra Sociedad debe comprometerse con los temas del \npa\u00eds que le ata\u00f1en y en los que pensamos que puede realizar un aporte \u00fatil e importante. En este sentido, \ncomenzando con la presidencia de Cristina y continuando este a\u00f1o, hemos hecho p\u00fablico documentos que \ntuvieron como \u00fanico objetivo brindarle a la sociedad una visi\u00f3n cient\u00edfica sobre los temas relacionados con \nla vacunaci\u00f3n y el manejo de la pandemia ante la sorprendente difusi\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n incorrecta que en \nmuchos casos induc\u00eda en la poblaci\u00f3n temor y resistencia a la vacunaci\u00f3n. Este a\u00f1o la SAIC se ha incorpo -\nrado al \u201cForo de Sociedades Cient\u00edficas, Organizaciones de la Sociedad Civil y Universidades\u201d y en conjunto \ncon las muchas organizaciones que constituyen este foro, tambi\u00e9n hemos emitido varios documentos en el \nmismo sentido y con el mismo objetivo. Creemos que la enorme difusi\u00f3n de estos documentos, as\u00ed como la \nalta repercusi\u00f3n que tuvieron, demuestra que es un aporte necesario e importante que SAIC puede realizar.\nLa SAIC fue creada en 1960 por el Dr. Alfredo Lanari en conjunto con otros prestigiosos investigadores, con \nel objetivo principal de contribuir al desarrollo de la investigaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica y aplicada y a la difusi\u00f3n del cono -\ncimiento cient\u00edfico en el \u00e1mbito de la biomedicina. En un principio, su contenido cient\u00edfico era principalmente \nfisiol\u00f3gico y cl\u00ednico, de all\u00ed el nombre de Sociedad Argentina de Investigaci\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica. Sin embargo, con el \npaso del tiempo y con el desarrollo del conocimiento cient\u00edfico fue incorporando diversas tem\u00e1ticas incluyen -\ndo los mecanismos celulares, moleculares y gen\u00f3micos que contribuyen al desarrollo de las diversas patolo -\ng\u00edas. Por esta raz\u00f3n, la mayor\u00eda de los integrantes de SAIC actualmente investigamos en lo que podr\u00edamos denominar investigaci\u00f3n biom\u00e9dica b\u00e1sica. Pensamos que, sin descuidar esta importante orientaci\u00f3n en la \nque tanto se ha destacado la comunidad cient\u00edfica de nuestros socios, tambi\u00e9n debemos hacer un esfuerzo \npara tender un puente entre estas investigaciones y su aplicaci\u00f3n en el \u00e1mbito cl\u00ednico. En este sentido, el \na\u00f1o pasado se instituy\u00f3 el premio Prof. Dr. Horacio A. Repetto en el \u00e1rea de enfermedades infecciosas pe -\ndi\u00e1tricas. Este a\u00f1o hemos mantenido la organizaci\u00f3n de este premio tratando de incentivar la participaci\u00f3n \nde investigadores cl\u00ednicos en este \u00e1rea y hemos establecido un convenio de colaboraci\u00f3n rec\u00edproca con la \nSociedad Argentina de Pediatr\u00eda. Debo agradecer en este punto la colaboraci\u00f3n de las Dras. Cristina Ibarra \ny Mar\u00eda Marta Amaral. Tambi\u00e9n hemos iniciado conversaciones con la Sociedad Argentina de Patolog\u00eda para \nestablecer un convenio similar. Como se puede observar en el programa de esta reuni\u00f3n anual, muchas \nconferencias y simposios fueron organizados teniendo presente este objetivo, como por ejemplo la confe -\nrencia inaugural \u201cImmune checkpoint blockade in cancer therapy: new insights into therapeutic mechanisms\u201d \na cargo del premio nobel PhD James P. Allison y los simposios \u201cTranslational research\u201d y \u201cTranslational \nresearch in oncology: preclinical, clinical and healthcare approaches\u201d organizados con la colaboraci\u00f3n de la \nDra. Laura Bover y el Dr. Daniel Alonso, respectivamente.\nSin duda la pandemia nos ha causado mucho dolor y sufrimiento pero tambi\u00e9n ha tenido un costado favo -\nrable para la ciencia. En primer lugar ha demostrado algo que ya sab\u00edamos y que la historia nos demuestra \npero que una parte de la sociedad muchas veces parece olvidar y es que las soluciones a los grandes pro -\nblemas de la humanidad no pueden prescindir de los conocimientos cient\u00edficos.\nMucho se repite que el desarrollo social y econ\u00f3mico de un pa\u00eds depende del desarrollo  cient\u00edfico  y  tecno -\nl\u00f3gico  del mismo.  Sin  embargo,  a  veces  tengo  la sensaci\u00f3n que muchos investigadores de nuestro pa\u00eds \nno tienen la \u00edntima convicci\u00f3n que esto sea verdad. Siempre me sorprendi\u00f3, cuando en a\u00f1os anteriores el \ngobierno de turno decidi\u00f3 incrementar el n\u00famero de investigadores y becarios del CONICET y fomentar el \nretorno de los que estaban fuera del pa\u00eds, escuchar a mucho colegas decir que ese incremento era dema -\nsiado, que era \u201cun lujo\u201d que un pa\u00eds como el nuestro no pod\u00eda darse. Esto es m\u00e1s sorprendente si pensamos \nque muchos de los investigadores hemos tenido la oportunidad de trabajar en otros pa\u00edses y hemos visto \nque los mismos tienen una mayor cantidad de investigadores en relaci\u00f3n a la poblaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3micamente \nactiva (PEA) y que sin duda de esto y de la inversi\u00f3n en ciencia y tecnolog\u00eda depende el desarrollo que han \nalcanzado. Es oportuno citar aqu\u00ed las palabras de uno de nuestros premios Nobel, el Dr. Bernardo Houssay: \n\u201cLa disyuntiva es clara, o bien se cultiva la ciencia y la investigaci\u00f3n y el pa\u00eds es pr\u00f3spero y adelanta, o bien \nno se la practica debidamente y el pa\u00eds se estanca y retrocede. Los pa\u00edses ricos lo son porque dedican \ndinero al desarrollo cient\u00edfico-tecnol\u00f3gico y los pa\u00edses pobres lo siguen siendo si no lo hacen. La ciencia no \nes cara, cara es la ignorancia\u201d\nSi no estamos convencidos nosotros mismos de la relevancia de lo que hacemos para el desarrollo de nues -\ntro pa\u00eds, dif\u00edcilmente podremos convencer al resto de la sociedad y a la dirigencia pol\u00edtica de la importancia \nde apoyar e invertir en ciencia y tecnolog\u00eda.\nEs en este sentido que creo que la pandemia ha sido positiva, pues la sociedad ha visto c\u00f3mo numerosos \ngrupos de investigaci\u00f3n de \u00e1reas como la biomedicina y las ciencias sociales de nuestro pa\u00eds r\u00e1pidamente \naplicaron sus conocimientos al tratamiento y control de la Covid-19 con notables resultados.\nTambi\u00e9n se ha demostrado que los investigadores, y como dec\u00eda m\u00e1s arriba las sociedades cient\u00edficas, \ntienen un important\u00edsimo rol en la difusi\u00f3n del conocimiento cient\u00edfico hacia el resto de la sociedad, especial -\nmente cuando surgen informaciones falaces y anticient\u00edficas como las que lamentablemente han circulado \ndurante el transcurso de la pandemia.\nCreo que esta es la senda en la que, como comunidad cient\u00edfica, debemos perseverar y en este sentido \ndeseo destacar enf\u00e1ticamente, porque seg\u00fan mi parecer no ha sido suficientemente difundida y valorada en \ntoda su importancia, la reciente sanci\u00f3n por unanimidad en ambas c\u00e1maras del Poder Legislativo (el 24 de \nfebrero del 2021 fue votada en el Senado) de la \u201cLey de Financiamiento del Sistema Nacional de Ciencia, \nTecnolog\u00eda e Innovaci\u00f3n\u201d que hab\u00eda sido presentada originalmente en el a\u00f1o 2015. Dicha ley plantea incre -\nmentar el presupuesto para el \u00e1rea desde el 0.28% del PBI actual hasta el 1% del PBI en el 2032. Cabe \ndestacar que la ley tambi\u00e9n indica que si un a\u00f1o el PBI disminuye, no se puede destinar menos presupuesto \nque el a\u00f1o anterior.La alternancia hist\u00f3rica de dos modelos econ\u00f3micos contrapuestos, uno de desarrollo industrial y tecno -\nl\u00f3gico con exportaci\u00f3n de productos con valor agregado y otro de producci\u00f3n y exportaci\u00f3n de productos \nprimarios, ha hecho que el apoyo al sector cient\u00edfico y tecnol\u00f3gico en nuestro pa\u00eds tenga avances en el \nprimer caso y retrocesos en el segundo. La aprobaci\u00f3n de esta ley y su votaci\u00f3n por unanimidad en ambas \nc\u00e1maras parecer\u00eda indicar que el apoyo a la ciencia ser\u00e1 de ahora en m\u00e1s una pol\u00edtica de estado. Sin em -\nbargo, tambi\u00e9n es cierto que en el pasado reciente leyes votadas con amplios consensos luego no fueron \naplicadas o fueron derogadas. Depender\u00e1 en parte de que la comunidad cient\u00edfica y los organismos que nos \nrepresentan, como es el caso de nuestra querida SAIC, hagan escuchar su voz fuerte y clara para exigir el \ntotal cumplimiento de esta ley.\nLas autoridades de las cuatro sociedades cient\u00edficas que organizan esta reuni\u00f3n anual hemos esperado \nhasta el \u00faltimo momento para ver si pod\u00edamos realizarla aunque sea en forma parcialmente presencial, lo \nque finalmente no fue posible. No obstante hemos hecho un enorme esfuerzo y hemos dado lo mejor de \nnosotros para vencer las dificultades y limitaciones que nos impuso la pandemia. Esperamos que a pesar \nde estas dificultades hayamos logrado organizar una reuni\u00f3n que les sea de provecho y especialmente que \ncontribuya a la formaci\u00f3n de nuestros j\u00f3venes investigadores.\n\u00a1Ojal\u00e1 que sea de su agrado y la disfruten!Discurso de la Dra. Mariana Maccioni, Presidenta SAI.\nEstimadas y estimados miembros de las sociedades hoy reunidas, colegas, amigas y amigos:\nEn nombre de la Comisi\u00f3n Directiva de la Sociedad Argentina de Inmunolog\u00eda les doy la bienvenida a \nnuestra Reuni\u00f3n Anual n\u00famero 69, que se realizar\u00e1 en conjunto con la Sociedad Argentina de Investigaci\u00f3n \nCl\u00ednica, la Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Farmacolog\u00eda Experimental y la Sociedad Argentina de Nanomedicinas. \nHa sido muy grato compartir con las autoridades de estas sociedades el desaf\u00edo de organizar este evento \nvirtual, en un clima de cordialidad, en donde las desaveniencias se resolvieron con afabilidad y compren -\nsi\u00f3n. Mis m\u00e1s sinceros agradecimientos a todos ellos. \nSi bien sabemos que la virtualidad no reemplaza en absoluto el encuentro presencial, el abrazo entre cole -\ngas tan a\u00f1orado, esperamos que en estos tres d\u00edas y medio interactuemos, se promuevan nuevas colabo -\nraciones y se generen discusiones enriquecedoras en un entorno amigable. \nLa organizaci\u00f3n de este Congreso se llev\u00f3 a cabo en un a\u00f1o te\u00f1ido por la desaz\u00f3n de una pandemia que \nreci\u00e9n comienza a apaciguarse y en el que la Ciencia en general y la Inmunolog\u00eda en particular consolida -\nron su rol protag\u00f3nico inesperado, erigi\u00e9ndose como la dosis de esperanza requerida para atravesarlo. Un \na\u00f1o que nos encontr\u00f3 con la experiencia acumulada durante el 2020 en cuanto al uso y la potencialidad de \nlas plataformas virtuales, a las cuales nos propusimos sacarles el m\u00e1ximo provecho. Un a\u00f1o en el que los \ncient\u00edficos y cient\u00edficas continuamos alejados de nuestras actividades habituales, procurando atender los \nproblemas inmediatos que nuestras respectivas comunidades demandaban y en el que tuvimos que apren -\nder a comunicar y a divulgar novedades cient\u00edficas sumamente cambiantes. Un a\u00f1o en el que la aparici\u00f3n \nde las vacunas puso a la Inmunolog\u00eda bajo la lupa de toda la sociedad. \nJustamente, por este contexto, en donde la salud y la ciencia fueron prioridad, el Gobierno Nacional declar\u00f3 \nel a\u00f1o 2021 como el a\u00f1o de homenaje al premio Nobel de Medicina C\u00e9sar Milstein, no solamente porque \nsu legado configur\u00f3 un hito en la historia de la medicina, influyendo en la inmunolog\u00eda, la oncolog\u00eda, la bio -\ntecnolog\u00eda y la industria, sino porque C\u00e9sar Milstein representa el modelo de cient\u00edfico apasionado por el \nconocimiento b\u00e1sico, pero comprometido con la realidad, capaz de vislumbrar que la curiosidad, y por ende \nel quehacer cient\u00edfico, son una fuente de desarrollo, riqueza y soberan\u00eda para los pueblos. \nEn sus propias palabras \u201cla ciencia y la investigaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica son como una pieza de cristal, hermosa, he -\ncha por un gran artista, pero de cristal. En cualquier momento, por un mal movimiento, a veces queriendo \nhacerlo y a veces sin darse cuenta, esa pieza de cristal se rompe y se pierden a\u00f1os y a\u00f1os de trabajo y de \npreparaci\u00f3n\u2026\u201d. Una frase pronunciada hace m\u00e1s de 30 a\u00f1os que tiene m\u00e1s vigencia que nunca.  \nEs por ello, que celebramos la sanci\u00f3n de la tan anhelada Ley de Financiamiento del Sistema Nacional de \nCiencia, Tecnolog\u00eda e Innovaci\u00f3n, en la que se declara de inter\u00e9s nacional el establecer un \u201cincremento \nprogresivo y sostenido del presupuesto nacional\u201d destinado al \u00e1rea \u201cpor su capacidad estrat\u00e9gica para el \ndesarrollo econ\u00f3mico, social y ambiental\u201d. Esperamos sinceramente que su implementaci\u00f3n no est\u00e9 atada \na los vaivenes ideol\u00f3gicos de turno y que se transforme realmente en una pol\u00edtica de Estado a largo plazo.  \nUno de los desaf\u00edos que esta norma propone es la de lograr la federalizaci\u00f3n del sistema cient\u00edfico, una \ndeuda pendiente que implica \u201cla producci\u00f3n, difusi\u00f3n y apropiaci\u00f3n del conocimiento cient\u00edfico y tecnol\u00f3gi -\nco en todo el territorio nacional, priorizando las zonas geogr\u00e1ficas de menor desarrollo relativo\u201d.  Los que \ntrabajamos y vivimos en el interior sabemos de las enormes dificultades e inequidades existentes que se \nmagnifican cuanto m\u00e1s lejos de Buenos Aires nos encontremos, desaprovechando as\u00ed un enorme poten -\ncial de desarrollo para nuestro pa\u00eds. Muchas veces, a igualdad de talento y esfuerzo, los resultados son \nsignificativamente m\u00e1s pobres en el interior, ya que los procedimientos burocr\u00e1ticos se complejizan, incre -\nmentando costos y tiempos. Si realmente se entiende el  potencial estrat\u00e9gico del desarrollo de una ciencia \nde calidad en el interior del pa\u00eds para el progreso nacional, se requiere de pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas, nacionales y \ntambi\u00e9n provinciales coordinadas que, por citar s\u00f3lo un ejemplo, alivianen el impacto de los gastos de env\u00edo \ny transporte que deben afrontarse con subsidios de montos similares otorgados a investigadores alojados a lo largo y ancho de nuestro pa\u00eds.  Adem\u00e1s, a pesar de los esfuerzos que se realizan, siguen existiendo fallas \nen el flujo comunicacional que invisibilizan el trabajo, en muchos casos altamente promisorio, de los grupos \nde investigaci\u00f3n del interior. Mucho se ha avanzado, pero a\u00fan nos queda un largo camino por recorrer, para \nresolver un problema que tiene tantos a\u00f1os como la ciencia argentina misma.\nLa pandemia tambi\u00e9n abri\u00f3 nuevas oportunidades de participaci\u00f3n y permiti\u00f3 que muchos de nuestros \nmiembros, como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n nuestra recientemente creada Comisi\u00f3n Covid-19, a cuyos integrantes agra -\ndezco profundamente, se convirtieran en actores cruciales de esta coyuntura hist\u00f3rica, asesorando a la  \nSubsecretaria de Estrategias Sanitarias del Ministerio de Salud de la Naci\u00f3n, a la Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de \nEpidemiolog\u00eda e Informaci\u00f3n Estrat\u00e9gica, y a la Defensor\u00eda del P\u00fablico de Servicios de Comunicaci\u00f3n Audio -\nvisual.  Agradecemos a los encargados de las diferentes reparticiones nacionales su confianza en nuestra \nSociedad y esperamos que este nuevo v\u00ednculo con otras reparticiones p\u00fablicas, no asociadas tradicional -\nmente a la ciencia, se consolide y robustezca en el futuro.   \nDesde la Comisi\u00f3n Directiva trabajamos intensamente para estar a la altura de las circunstancias,  esta -\nbleciendo un cronograma de actividades virtuales mensuales que tuvieron como objetivo la formaci\u00f3n y \nactualizaci\u00f3n permanente de nuestros socios, no s\u00f3lo en los temas que cl\u00e1sicamente han sido el foco de \nestudio de nuestra Sociedad, sino que exploramos otras tem\u00e1ticas, como por ejemplo, la ense\u00f1anza de la \nInmunolog\u00eda en el grado y posgrado. Adem\u00e1s, promovimos la visualizaci\u00f3n de las actividades que nuestros \nsocios y socias m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes realizaron para combatir la informaci\u00f3n falsa y para generar confianza en la \nvacunaci\u00f3n.  Por otra parte, haci\u00e9ndonos eco de una demanda de nuestros inmun\u00f3logos cl\u00ednicos, tratamos \nde motivar su participaci\u00f3n en nuestra Sociedad, generando actividades de su inter\u00e9s particular. Quisiera \nagradecer especialmente a la Comisi\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica, que ha desempe\u00f1ado su rol con suma responsabilidad \natendiendo m\u00e1s de 50 consultas durante el a\u00f1o. \nEntendiendo la importancia de la divulgaci\u00f3n y comunicaci\u00f3n de la ciencia en este momento hist\u00f3rico, gene -\nramos un Concurso Nacional de MiniVideos #LasVacunasfuncionan en conjunto con la Academia Nacional \nde Ciencias, para ni\u00f1os de edad escolar de nivel inicial a secundario, que nos sorprendi\u00f3 gratamente por la \ncantidad y calidad de los trabajos  y la alta participaci\u00f3n a nivel nacional. Uds podr\u00e1n disfrutar de algunos \nlos trabajos representativos ya que ser\u00e1n transmitidos en el escaso tiempo libre que tenemos en el Congre -\nso. Agradezco el compromiso y dedicaci\u00f3n de la Comisi\u00f3n de Docencia que particip\u00f3 activamente en este \ndesaf\u00edo.\nUna motivaci\u00f3n para continuar con nuestro trabajo diario es la continua solicitud de nuevas membres\u00edas y \nreincorporaciones que este a\u00f1o ascienden a 36, no s\u00f3lo de miembros adherentes, sino tambi\u00e9n de miem -\nbros titulares. Adem\u00e1s, aun en este contexto desfavorable, hemos recibido m\u00e1s de 150 p\u00f3sters y dos pre -\nsentaciones a premios Satz. Nuestro comit\u00e9 cient\u00edfico, a quien tambi\u00e9n quisiera reconocer por su compro -\nmiso y dedicaci\u00f3n, ha trabajado arduamente para aprovechar los beneficios de la virtualidad y proponer un \nprograma cient\u00edfico de calidad.\nPara finalizar, me gustar\u00eda agradecer a la Comisi\u00f3n Directiva, con quien trabajamos arduamente en un \nentorno de cordialidad que hizo amenos nuestros encuentros virtuales. Particularmente, a nuestro vicepre -\nsidente, Dr. Emilio Malchiodi, quien siempre apoy\u00f3 con una actitud positiva nuestras propuestas e ideas. A \nla Dra Silvia Correa, nuestra Secretaria, por su presencia, su apoyo incondicional y su capacidad de orga -\nnizaci\u00f3n. A Mercedes Fuertes, nuestra tesorera por su compromiso y disposici\u00f3n. A CONICET y al MINCyT \nque nos apoy\u00f3 financieramente. Vuelvo agradecer a todas y todos los integrantes de nuestras comisiones \nad-hoc, incluyendo a los que se dedicaron al manejo de nuestras redes sociales. Les doy tambi\u00e9n mi agra -\ndecimiento al grupo G2 y a todos los y las participantes, coordinadores, y evaluadores.\nEspero que disfruten al m\u00e1ximo este programa que hemos desarrollado con mucho entusiasmo y anhelo \nque prontamente podamos volver a encontrarnos en la tan a\u00f1orada reuni\u00f3n presencial. \nNoviembre, 2021.Discurso de la Dra. Paula Schaiquevich, Presidenta AAFE.\nQueridos colegas\nEs un honor para m\u00ed darles la bienvenida a la LIII reuni\u00f3n anual de la Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Farmacolog\u00eda \nExperimental (AAFE) que se realiza de manera conjunta este a\u00f1o con la Sociedad Argentina de Investiga -\nci\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica, Sociedad de Inmunolog\u00eda y la Sociedad Argentina de Nanomedicinas.\nEn primer lugar, agradezco el trabajo, dedicaci\u00f3n y compromiso de los miembros de las comisiones direc -\ntivas pertenecientes a las sociedades cient\u00edficas biom\u00e9dicas que participamos de este evento, para llevar \nadelante la reuni\u00f3n anual que hoy nos convoca en tan importante evento acad\u00e9mico-cient\u00edfico.\nUna vez m\u00e1s, debemos desarrollar la presente reuni\u00f3n de manera virtual como es de p\u00fablico conocimien -\nto como consecuencia de la pandemia de COVID-19.  A pesar de la distancia f\u00edsica,  nos encontraremos \ncercanos, compartiendo d\u00edas con alta intensidad de contenidos acad\u00e9micos abordando una diversidad de \ntem\u00e1ticas biom\u00e9dicas y con la participaci\u00f3n de un gran n\u00famero de oradores convocados por las diversas \nsociedades cient\u00edficas. Es de remarcar, que los investigadores j\u00f3venes y becarios tendr\u00e1n una especial \nparticipaci\u00f3n lo que denota el compromiso de nuestras sociedades para formar y transmitir el conocimiento \ncient\u00edfico.\nDesde sus comienzos, la existencia y desarrollo de la AAFE se bas\u00f3 en nuclear a los investigadores que tra -\nbajasen en tem\u00e1ticas relacionadas con farmacolog\u00eda experimental y cl\u00ednica tal de impulsar el desarrollo de \nesta disciplina en el pa\u00eds, estrechar las relaciones y complementar el trabajo de investigaci\u00f3n entre farmac\u00f3 -\nlogos y promover el adelanto y divulgaci\u00f3n de los conocimientos en farmacolog\u00eda fomentando el intercambio \ncient\u00edfico entre los miembros de la sociedad y la vinculaci\u00f3n entre farmac\u00f3logos de la regi\u00f3n. La AAFE es \nuna sociedad cient\u00edfica que ha transitado 52 a\u00f1os de actividad ininterrumpida, a\u00f1os durante los que han \nparticipado y participan diversos cient\u00edficos vinculados a la investigaci\u00f3n en todas las \u00e1reas de la farmacolo -\ng\u00eda, generando v\u00ednculos con otras sociedades cient\u00edficas nacionales, as\u00ed como de la regi\u00f3n latinoamericana \ny a nivel internacional siendo miembro participe de la International Union of Pharmacology (IUPHAR). En \neste sentido, es nuestro enorme placer contar en esta ocasi\u00f3n con el presidente y secretario de la IUPHAR \ncomo disertantes as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n, de miembros de las comisiones cient\u00edficas de sociedades hermanas \ndel \u00e1rea de farmacolog\u00eda de Brasil y Chile. Es nuestra intenci\u00f3n que la AAFE mantenga y potencie su lugar \nen el campo de la farmacolog\u00eda internacional, manteniendo v\u00ednculos ya existentes y generando nuevas \ncolaboraciones para fomentar los aspectos acad\u00e9micos y cient\u00edficos de la farmacolog\u00eda en un entorno de \nintegraci\u00f3n multidisciplinaria. \nActualmente, y siguiendo las tendencias internacionales, los miembros de la asociaci\u00f3n trabajamos activa -\nmente en farmacolog\u00eda b\u00e1sica y asimismo tenemos una fuerte representaci\u00f3n de expertos en farmacolog\u00eda \ncl\u00ednica humana y veterinaria. En este sentido, se denota el compromiso de nuestros investigadores con \nla comunidad, reforzando el rol de los mismos en las decisiones cl\u00ednicas y farmacol\u00f3gicas, mostrando un \ncompromiso con nuestra sociedad para brindar respuestas en el \u00e1rea de la farmacolog\u00eda que as\u00ed se requie -\nran. Hemos y continuamos teniendo un rol importante en esta situaci\u00f3n tan particular que nos toca vivir, la \npandemia de COVID-19, en la que los avances farmacol\u00f3gicos de nuevas mol\u00e9culas, f\u00e1rmacos de reposi -\ncionamiento y la evaluaci\u00f3n e identificaci\u00f3n de nuevos tratamientos han sido fundamentales para brindar \nalternativas terap\u00e9uticas en un cort\u00edsimo plazo de evaluaci\u00f3n.  Esto denota la necesidad de reforzar y po -\ntenciar la participaci\u00f3n del farmac\u00f3logo cl\u00ednico en nuestra asociaci\u00f3n para satisfacer las necesidades de la \nsociedad e incluso agencias regulatorias. Es por ello, que nuestra visi\u00f3n es la de ser la asociaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica \nreferente para el asesoramiento t\u00e9cnico-social y regulatorio para la toma de decisiones en aspectos relacio -nados con la farmacolog\u00eda cl\u00ednica de medicamentos y productos en desarrollo en poblaciones diversas que \nas\u00ed lo requieran en Argentina. \nEsperamos que puedan aprovechar los contenidos brindados en esta reuni\u00f3n anual, que puedan participar \nactivamente de las actividades programadas, fomentando el intercambio cient\u00edfico-acad\u00e9mico entre miem -\nbros de la comunidad cient\u00edfica de las diversas sociedades que hoy nos reunimos con una visi\u00f3n integrado -\nra, multi0 y transdisciplinaria.  \nEn nombre de la comisi\u00f3n directiva de AAFE les dejo un saludo afectuoso y los invito una vez m\u00e1s a partici -\npar activamente de la reuni\u00f3n anual. Discurso de la Dra. Hebe Dur\u00e1n, Presidenta Nanomed-ar.\nQuerid@s compa\u00f1er@s y amig@s de la comunidad cient\u00edfica,\nNos encontramos este a\u00f1o nuevamente para participar de la Reuni\u00f3n Conjunta de Sociedades de Biocien -\ncias. Me dirijo a ustedes como Presidenta de la Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Nanomedicinas (Nanomed-ar) en \nrepresentaci\u00f3n de nuestra Comisi\u00f3n Directiva. En esta oportunidad compartimos esta reuni\u00f3n con SAIC, \nSAI y AAFE. Mantenemos nuestro inter\u00e9s en la concreci\u00f3n de estas reuniones conjuntas con otras Socieda -\ndes del \u00e1rea Biom\u00e9dica, con la visi\u00f3n de que la discusi\u00f3n de avances cient\u00edficos en el \u00e1rea es muy relevante \ndado el car\u00e1cter multidisciplinario de la Nanomedicina. La difusi\u00f3n de trabajos en un \u00e1mbito donde confluyen \ncient\u00edfic@s dedicados a tem\u00e1ticas diversas de la Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica resulta sumamente valioso para \nla generaci\u00f3n de nuevas ideas que permitan el desarrollo de proyectos enfocados a la resoluci\u00f3n de proble -\nmas relacionados con la Salud.  \nNo podemos dejar de mencionar que el contexto de pandemia en que se ha visto inmerso no solo nuestro \npa\u00eds, sino el mundo entero durante los \u00faltimos dos a\u00f1os, nos ha enfrentado a toda la humanidad a nuevos \ndesaf\u00edos para poder salir adelante de una situaci\u00f3n global extremadamente dolorosa. La pandemia demos -\ntr\u00f3 fuertemente el valor de la Ciencia y la Tecnolog\u00eda y de un fuerte Sistema P\u00fablico de Salud. Nuestro pa\u00eds, \nm\u00e1s all\u00e1 de dificultades, ha estado a la altura de los desaf\u00edos tanto en C&T como en Salud, sabiendo lo \nque esto signific\u00f3 para todo el personal esencial, principalmente en el \u00e1rea de la Salud. Nos queda el sabor \namargo de las p\u00e9rdidas en vidas que esta pandemia nos ha dejado. Desde Nanomed-ar, agradecemos a las \ny los trabajadores esenciales que han permitido sobrellevar estos tiempos de pandemia y aislamiento de la \nmejor manera posible. Hoy, en noviembre de 2021, vemos un horizonte de salida, gracias al r\u00e1pido avance \nde la implementaci\u00f3n de vacunas anti-COVID.\nAsimismo, para sobrellevar estos tiempos, debimos reformular las formas de comunicarnos e interactuar \npara poder seguir trabajando, compartiendo eventos, dando y recibiendo clases en todos los niveles edu -\ncativos. La virtualidad se nos hizo cotidiana, con todas las dificultades que eso implica, aunque tambi\u00e9n \npudimos obtener algunas ventajas, como el hecho de acercarnos a quienes habitualmente no podemos \ninteractuar por largas distancias y costosos viajes para encontrarnos en un meeting. A modo de ejemplo, \nen la Reuni\u00f3n Anual 2020 de Nanomed-ar realizada de forma virtual, pudimos contar con la participaci\u00f3n \nde prestigios@s cient\u00edfic@s de diferentes partes del mundo, quienes de forma desinteresada se mostraron \nabiert@s, no s\u00f3lo a disertar, sino tambi\u00e9n a participar en fruct\u00edferas discusiones cient\u00edficas, sin importar \nen algunos casos las enormes diferencias horarias que llevaron a algunos Investigadores a participar en \nhorarios nocturnos.\nCon respecto a nuestra Asociaci\u00f3n, realizamos en este evento conjunto, nuestra XI Reuni\u00f3n Anual y esta -\nmos cumpliendo 11 a\u00f1os de la creaci\u00f3n de Nanomed-ar. Quiero saludar y agradecer a quienes me precedie -\nron en la conducci\u00f3n de Nanomed-ar, cient\u00edficas y cient\u00edficos pioneros en el desarrollo de la Nanomedicina \nen nuestro pa\u00eds.\nQuiero recalcar tambi\u00e9n que nuestra Asociaci\u00f3n ha valorizado siempre la posibilidad de dar lugar a j\u00f3venes \ninvestigadores en formaci\u00f3n y estudiantes de doctorado y de grado, d\u00e1ndoles la oportunidad de presentar \nsus trabajos en sesiones conjuntas con Investigadores formados de amplia trayectoria, sumado al incentivo \nde premios a los mejores trabajos presentados en sesiones de posters o mini-orales.\nEste a\u00f1o la Reuni\u00f3n Conjunta cuenta con numerosos simposios, conferencias, sesiones de posters que \nabarcan una enorme variedad de tem\u00e1ticas, sumando adem\u00e1s simposios dedicados a la presentaci\u00f3n de \nlogros de grupos de investigaci\u00f3n del pa\u00eds en la lucha contra la pandemia. El excelente programa que po -\ndr\u00e1n apreciar es fruto de la intensa actividad realizada por los miembros de las Comisiones Directivas de \nlas cuatro sociedades participantes, quienes conjuntamente con la empresa G2 y la Secretaria de SAIC, \nse cargaron al hombro la laboriosa tarea de ocuparse de todas las actividades requeridas para que esta \nReuni\u00f3n sea un \u00e9xito en su formato virtual. Agradezco tambi\u00e9n a todas y todos los participantes, Investigadores, Becarias y Becarios y Asistentes a la \nReuni\u00f3n Anual que se suman a este evento.\nEn particular, como Nanomed-ar, quiero agradecer a los Coordinadores de Simposios y a l@s miembros \ndel Comit\u00e9 Cient\u00edfico, por su trabajo conjunto en la coordinaci\u00f3n y selecci\u00f3n  de premios y a los subsidios y \nauspicios que hemos recibido de la ANPCyT, la Fundaci\u00f3n Balseiro, la Fundaci\u00f3n Argentina de Nanotecno -\nlog\u00eda y la empresa Atom Protect.\nPara cerrar y pensando en un contexto m\u00e1s global, como cient\u00edfic@s responsables debemos ser cons -\ncientes de la importante necesidad de alertar a los poderes gobernantes de la importancia de la C&T para \nmejorar las condiciones de vida y las condiciones del planeta que nos alberga. Se requieren pol\u00edticas de \nC&T  que apunten a adoptar medidas para frenar el cambio clim\u00e1tico, mejorar las posibilidades de Salud \ne implementar pol\u00edticas que tiendan a lograr condiciones de vida dignas en todas las regiones del planeta. \nPara esto los que manejan los poderes del mundo necesitan a tod@s los cient\u00edfic@s no solo de nuestras \n\u00e1reas de Salud y Biociencias, sino de todas las \u00e1reas del conocimiento. Aportemos nuestros granitos de \narena en esta direcci\u00f3n.\nSin m\u00e1s que agregar, les deseamos a tod@s que disfruten de esta Reuni\u00f3n Anual Conjunta y esperamos \nque en el a\u00f1o 2022, la situaci\u00f3n de Salud P\u00fablica nos permita la presencialidad y podamos encontrarnos en \nnuestra Reuni\u00f3n Anual de NANOMED-ar.MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 202118\nCONFERENCIA SAIC I\nChair: Dra. Edith Kordon\nREDIRECTING IMMUNE CELLS AGAINST BREAST CANCER\nMacarena Rom\u00e1n 2, Marta Bort 1, Andrea Mir\u00f3 1, Alex Mart\u00ednez-Sabadell 2, Enrique Arenas 2 and Joaqu\u00edn Arribas1, 2\n1 Cancer Research Program, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM) and 2 Preclinical Research Program, \nVall d\u2019Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO)\nIt is currently clear that T lymphocytes can be efficiently \nredirected against tumor cells through chimeric antigen \nreceptors (CARs) or T-cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs). \nDespite the potential of this therapeutic strategy, to date \nonly CARs and TCBs targeting certain hematological \nmalignancies have been approved to treat patients; no \nCAR or TCB has been proven effective against solid tu -\nmors yet in the clinic. One of the main hurdles in the de -\nvelopment of CARs and TCBs is the scarcity of genuine \ntumor-specific antigens. Because of this shortage, CARs \nand TCBs have been directed against tumor-associated \nantigens, which are also expressed in normal tissues, al -\nbeit at lower levels. These CARs and TCBs have caused \nserious or even fatal toxicities because of their \u201con-target \noff-tumor\u201d effects on normal tissues. To avoid these tox -\nicities, current clinical trials using CARs or TCBs target -\ning tumor-associated antigens, such as HER2, are per -\nformed with dosages that prevent intolerable side effects, \nlikely compromising anti-tumor efficacy.\nIn search for novel tumor-specific antigens, we focused in p95HER2, a truncated isoform of HER2 expressed in \na subset of HER2-amplified breast and gastric cancers. \nWe have recently shown that p95HER2 is undetectable \nin normal tissues, making it a very attractive tumor-spe -\ncific antigen against which it will be safe to direct T cells \nthrough CARs or TCBs. Proving the feasibility of this ap -\nproach, we have already generated and characterized a \np95HER2-TCB. This TCB has a potent anti-tumor effect \nagainst p95HER2-expressing tumors, but has no effect \non cells expressing normal levels of HER2. Based on \nthis solid foundation, we have recently: i) develop and \nfunctionally characterize CARs targeting p95HER2, ii) \nanalyze the efficacy and safety of p95HER2-TCB and \np95HER2-CAR on patient-derived models of HER2-pos -\nitive breast and gastric cancers, iii) arm these CARs to \nmake them effective against p95HER2-positive tumors, \nand iv) anticipate mechanisms of resistance against \nthese T cell-based therapies. \nIn summary, we will present novel and safe immune ther -\napies against a subset of HER2-positive cancers.\nCONFERENCIA SAI I LEONARDO SATZ\nChairs: Dra. Eloisa Arana y Dra. Romina Gamberale\nMECHANISMS OF MALIGNANT TRANSFORMATION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM\nAri Melnick1\n1Gebroe Family Professor of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medicine.\nDuring the humoral immune response, germinal center \n(GC) B cells undergo dramatic and rapid \u2010sequence phe -\nnotypic changes. Transitioning to the GC phenotype in -\nvolves deep remodeling of the 3D architecture of the ge -\nnome and extensive redistribution of epigenetic marks. \nThe GC B \u2010cell epigenome displays loss of chromatin \nactivating marks and gain of repressive marks at promot -\ners and enhancers for genes involved in cellular check -\npoints, B cell receptor signaling, interferon response, \nantigen presentation, and other mature B \u2010cell functions. \nThese genes are not \u201csilenced,\u201d but instead are simply \nheld in a poised configuration, where RNA Pol II is pres -\nent and loaded at promoters but is not actively transcrib -ing nascent mRNAs. This pattern is directed by BCL6 in \ndark zone GC B cells and lymphoma cells, and is revers -\nible by signals from T follicular helper (TFH) and follicular \ndendritic cells (FDC) in the light zone. BCL6 mediates \nthis transient repression effect by recruiting (a) SMRT/\nNCOR \u2010HDAC3 complexes, (b) BCOR \u2010RING1B com -\nplexes in cooperation with EZH2, and (c) the LSD1 his -\ntone demethylase through the BCL6 repression domain \n2 (RD2). MTA3 and CTBP may also be relevant BCL6 \ncorepressors but this has not been validated outside of \nthe cell line context. Activation of BCL6 target genes in \nthe light zone is mediated by the histone acetyltransfer -\nases CREBBP and EP300, and the histone methyltrans -LECTURES                                                                                 MEDICINA (Buenos Aires) 2021; 81 (Supl.

Along these lines, FL and GCB \u2010DLBCL \nmanifest almost universal somatic mutation of chroma -\ntin\u2010modifier genes (e.g. KMT2D, CREBBP, EZH2, TET2, \nand EP300). These data suggest that one of the most \ncritical vulnerable transitional states for pathogenesis of \nGC \u2010derived lymphomas involves epigenetic remodeling \ndownstream of signals received from TFH and FDCs in the light zone. Since epigenetic marks are inherently re -\nversible, it is likely possible to develop epigenetic therapy \nregimens to correct the defects induced by these muta -\ntions. Drugs such as EZH2 or HDAC3 specific inhibitors \nrepresent promising approaches for the treatment of \nthese GC-derived malignancies.\nCONFERENCIA AAFE - HOMENAJE AL DR.

He obtained \na Rotary Club scholarship to work at the \u201cIstituto Superio -\nre di Sanit\u00e0\u201d Rome, under the direction of Amilcare Carpi. \nThe high hierarchy of this Institute was a magnet, attract -\ned eminent scientists giving the possibility to meet and \ninteract with the greats of that time. He developed a close \nrelation with the Nobel Prize Daniel Bovet, Victor Whit -\ntaker and James Mc Gaugh. These were the solid basis \nthat constructed the personality of Otto Orsingher. At his \nreturn to Argentine was invited to join the group being \nformed by Ivan Izquierdo at the Pharmacology Depart -\nment, Faculty of Chemical Sciences of the University of \nC\u00f3rdoba. In the optimistic environment prevailing at that \ntime, formed with Izquierdo a duo of notable scientists \nwho will contribute to the growth of Pharmacological Sci -\nences. But things were not as good as thought and Izqui -\nerdo left C\u00f3rdoba in 1973 Orsingher took charge of the \nDepartment of Pharmacology and kept alive the working enthusiasm. He studied in rats the effects of perinatal \nundernutrition on the learning and memory performance \nof the adult animal and showed the importance of peri -\nnatal nutrition in the development of brain functions. His \nresearch performed 40 years ago is quoted nowadays \nby scientist working in this field (Perinatal undernutrition \nreduces alpha and beta adrenergic receptor binding in \nadult rat brain- Science, 1982). He also described the \nantiepileptic effects of cannabidiol, (Effect of cannabidiol \nand of other cannabis sativa compounds on hippocampal \nseizure discharges Psychopharmacologia, 1973). Of the \none hundred and odd citations that this work has, 20% \nare in publications after 2017, 44 years later.\nBesides his intense teaching activity he participated in \nthe organization the AAFE the Argentine Association for \nExperimental Pharmacology, Meetings etc. \nAppointed as Director of the INAME (The National Insti -\ntute of Drugs) in1993 he contributed to the transparency \nand modernization of the institution. \nOrsingher was not only an excellent scientist, he was a \ngood man, loyal to colleagues and interested in the ad -\nvancement of science and did not seek laurels or envy \nthose who seek them. \nMELATONIN. A MULTIFACTORIAL THERAPEUTIC RESOURCE WASTE IN THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC. \nDaniel P. Cardinali. \nFacultad de Ciencias M\u00e9dicas, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Argentina, Buenos Aires. \nWeb site: www.daniel-cardinali.blogspot.com \nThe current COVID-19 pandemic is the most devastating \nevent in recent history and a great challenge for health \npolicy and management. Considering the public health \nconsequences of COVID-19 pandemic and in the face of \nessentially no treatment options currently available, the \nuse of melatonin to treat COVID-19 disease has been \nproposed. Due to its wide-ranging effects as an antiox -\nidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory com -\npound, melatonin is uniquely placed to affect the conse -\nquences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, indirect \nevidence points to a possible antiviral action of melatonin \nby interfering with the SARS-CoV-2 / angiotensin-con -verting enzyme 2 association. Melatonin is also an ef -\nfective chronobiotic agent to reverse the circadian alter -\nation of social isolation and to control delirium in severely \naffected patients. As a cytoprotective, melatonin fights \nvarious comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, meta -\nbolic syndrome, and ischemic and non-ischemic cardio -\nvascular diseases that aggravate COVID-19 disease. In \nview of the evidence on the appearance of neurological \nsequelae in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, anoth -\ner possible application of melatonin is based on its neu -\nroprotective properties. Since melatonin is an effective \nmeans of controlling cognitive decline in the early stages MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 202120\nof Alzheimer\u2019s disease, its therapeutic importance for the \nneurological sequelae of COVID-19 should be consid -\nered. Finally, exogenous melatonin may be an adjuvant \ncapable of increasing the efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 \nvaccines. In this presentation I will review the experimen -\ntal evidence indicating that melatonin has a prominent therapeutic role in the COVID 19 pandemic. This multi -\nfactorial profile is unique to melatonin and is not shared \nby any other therapeutic drug candidate in the COVID \n19 pandemic. Controlled studies are urgently needed to \nsupport this proposal.\nCONFERENCIA INAUGURAL\nChair: Dra.

Allison, Ph.D. - Premio Nobel de Fisiolog\u00eda / Medicina 2018\nMD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.\nSince the finding that CTLA-4 is an immune checkpoint \nwhich inhibits T cell proliferation, the existence of multi -\nple non-redundant pathways that limit T cell responses, \nincluding the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, has been shown. Ipili -\nmumab, a checkpoint inhibitor antibody to CTLA-4 that \nblocks its interaction with B7 molecules on the surface \nof antigen presenting cells and prohibits T cell co-activa -\ntion, provides long-term survival benefit in ~20% of late \nstage melanoma patients. Many patients appear can -\ncer-free after a decade or more. PD-1/PD-L1 antagonist \nantibodies provide objective responses against several \ntumor types with response rates of about ~25%.  Com -\nbination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 increases the re -\nsponse rate to ~50% in late stage melanoma and is now \nstandard of care. The FDA has now approved at least 7 different checkpoint antibodies for a variety of cancers. \nStill, checkpoint inhibitors have yet to provide benefit to \npatients with immunologically cold tumors. Additionally, \npotentially severe immune adverse events limit their use \nin lower mutational burden cancers that often arise later \nin life. More recent work in my lab and the Immunother -\napy Platform centers on CyTOF and single cell RNAseq \nprofiling of tumor-infiltrating T cell populations that medi -\nate effective responses to current immune monothera -\npies and combinations. The results of this work provide \nan avenue to identify rational combination therapies that \ncould prove effective for patients and cancers that cur -\nrently do not respond to immunotherapy while amelio -\nrating potential side effects of increased immune activity.\nCONFERENCIA PLENARIA ALFREDO LANARI\nChair: Dr. Carlos Davio\nIRON METABOLISM IN OLIGODENDROCYTES AND ASTROCYTES: FRIEND OR FOE?\nJM Pasquini1,2, MV Rosato Siri1,2, PV Martino Adami3, ME Guitart1,2, MS Marcora1,2, L Morelli3 and J Correale4\n1Universidad de Buenos Aires, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica, Buenos Aires, Argentina; \n2Universidad de Buenos Aires-CONICET, Instituto de Qu\u00edmica y Fisicoqu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gicas (IQUIFIB), Buenos Aires, Argentina; \n3Instituto de Investigaciones Bioqu\u00edmicas de Buenos Aires, Laboratorio de Envejecimiento y Neurodegeneraci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires, \nArgentina; 4FLENI, Instituto de Investigaciones Neurol\u00f3gicas Dr. Ra\u00fal Carrea, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nRecent reports show that astrocytes (AST) are able to cre -\nate a permissive environment for remyelination through \ntheir action on oligodendrocyte (OLG) precursor migra -\ntion, proliferation, and differentiation. When disrupted, \niron homeostasis negatively impacts OLG differentiation \nand impairs myelination. We demonstrate that iron defi -\nciency (ID) affects not only OLG maturation but also AST. \nUsing gestational iron deprivation, we studied OLG re -\nquirements for their progression to a mature myelinating \nstate and energy metabolism in primary cultures of OLG \nand AST from newly born control and ID pups. In particular, \noxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates \nwere measured using a Seahorse extracellular flux analyz -\ner. Both ID AST and OLG exhibited decreased spare respi -\nratory capacity, which indicates that maternal ID effectively induces mitochondrial dysfunction. Absence of glycogen \ngranules was observed in ID AST and an increase in ROS \nproduction was detected in ID OLG. Mitochondrial fission \nwas increased in ID AST, while fusion was prevalent in ID \nOLG. Electron microscopy also showed abnormal cristae \nin ID mitochondria in OLG as well as in AST. These find -\nings further prove that the regulation of cell metabolism \nmay impact cell fate decisions and maturation.\nAn additional model of ID was developed by knock -\ning down the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), a \nmulti-metal transporter with a primary role in iron trans -\nport and present in AST and OLG. OLG maturation was \ncompromised in primary OPC cultures treated with con -\nditioned medium from DMT1-silenced AST, which sug -\ngests that molecules secreted by AST may be affected.LECTURES21\nCONFERENCIA SAICII\nChair: Dra. Ana Maria Eij\u00e1n\nMONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES FOR STUDY OF CANCER: DESIGN, PRODUCTION \nAND CLINICAL VALORATION\nLaura Bover\nUniversity of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA\nIn the early 1970s, the idea of producing identical antibod -\nies specific to a given antigen started to arise among the \nscientific community. It was successfully accomplished \nwhen K\u00f6hler, Milstein and Jerne created the process of \nproducing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)  and shared \nthe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984 for the \ndiscovery. MAbs generation for cancer poses a series of \nmajor technological challenges: 1) surface antigens ex -\npressed selectively/preferentially on cancer cells need to \nbe identified. 2) it is necessary to target specific epitopes \nwithin these antigens, that result in either tumor cell kill -\ning, activation or blocking of checkpoint molecules. 3) an \nantibody must be generated with the desired function, or \nfor particular applications (i.e cell internalization). 4) fur-\nther characterization and preclinical development of the \ncandidate MAb need to be undertaken. Importantly, the \nfirst and most critical step in therapeutic MAbs develop -\nment is the identification of antibodies that bind to \nnovel surface antigens expressed preferentially on \ncancer cells.  Contributing to this achievemet, significant \nprogress in our understanding of the cancer cell sur -\nfaceome and how it might be exploited therapeutically began around 40 years ago through a series of studies \nthat identified cell surface differentiation antigens used to \nidentify lineage and functional subsets of mouse leuko -\ncytes. In subsequent years, hybridoma technology, fluo -\nrescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and omics tools \nhave greatly expanded our knowledge in that field and \nhelped to identify exploitable targets. Moreover, the ad -\nvance on immunotherapy research in cancer biology, im -\nproved clinical outcomes prompting Science  magazine to \nname cancer immunotherapy as its 2013 Breakthrough \nof the Year and later added another Nobel Prize in 2018 \n(Allison and Honjo) to the many accomplishments of an -\ntibodies. Recognition of the power of immunotherapy has \nheightened interest and demand improved technologies \nto provide the cutting-edge, high-quality MAbs required \nfor today\u2019s basic, to translational to clinical researchers. \nOur Monoclonal Antibodies Laboratory at M.D. Anderson \nCancer Center has developed significant expertise in \ngenerating more than 360 MAbs  for various applications \nand recently licensed MAbs to Pharmaceutical compa -\nnies for use in clinical trials . We are going to discuss \nsome of our developments during this conference.\nCONFERENCIA SAIC III\nChair: Dr. Javier Cotignola\nTHE CANCER GENOME ATLAS, A USABLE GENOMIC RESOURCE?\nJean C Zenklusen\nNIH/NCI/CCG/TCGA\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a joint project of \nthe National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Hu -\nman Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). TCGA began \nin 2006 as a pilot project focused on three cancer types: \nlung, ovarian and glioblastoma. Due to the success of \nthe initial efforts, TCGA was reauthorized for a full pro -\nduction phase in 2009. In the following decade, TCGA \ncollected more than 11,000 cases across 33 tumor types, \nand generated a vast, comprehensive data set describ -\ning the molecular changes that occur in cancer. Tissue \nsample collection and data generation were completed \nin 2013 and 2016, respectively. Network maker papers, \nwhich are integrative cross-platform analyses of TCGA \ndata on individual cancer types have been published for \n31 of the tumor types to date (https://cancergenome.nih.\ngov/publications) \nThe value of the TCGA data set cannot be overstated. \nIts richness has enabled researchers to catalog specif -ic genomic and molecular changes that occur in cancer, \nto define a more meaningful taxonomy of cancer types \nand subtypes, and to even investigate questions that \nwere not imagined at the outset of the project, such as \nthe mining of the data to discover new viruses and other \nmicrobial agents. The TCGA marker papers have served \nas additional resources for understanding the molecular \nfeatures of these cancers, and a launching pad for indi -\nvidual researchers to deepen the exploration of the data \ngenerated.\nHowever, translation to the clinic of the wealth of informa -\ntion gathered during the project has been modest, mainly \nfor the lack of extensive clinical data and outcomes, but \nalso because we have not been able to truly comprehend \nthe complexity of the biological processes that underline \ncancer, focusing mainly on single gene mutations that \nare a poor reflection of the biological reality.MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Marina Palermo\nIMMUNE SURVEILLANCE OF THE LIVER BY CD8+ T CELLS\nMatteo Iannacone, MD PhD.\nSan Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, ITALY\nKupffer cells (KCs) are highly abundant, intravascular, \nliver-resident macrophages known for their scavenger \nand phagocytic functions. KCs can also present antigens \nto CD8+ T cells and promote either tolerance or effector \ndifferentiation, but the mechanisms underlying these dis -\ncrepant outcomes are poorly understood. Here, we used \na mouse model of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, in \nwhich HBV-specific naive CD8+ T cells recognizing hepa -\ntocellular antigens are driven into a state of immune dys -\nfunction, to identify a subset of KCs (referred to as KC2) that cross-presents hepatocellular antigens upon inter -\nleukin-2 (IL-2) administration, thus improving the antiviral \nfunction of T cells. Removing MHC-I from all KCs, in-\ncluding KC2, or selectively depleting KC2 impaired the \ncapacity of IL-2 to revert the T cell dysfunction induced \nby intrahepatic priming. In summary, by sensing IL-2 and \ncross-presenting hepatocellular antigens, KC2 overcome \nthe tolerogenic potential of the hepatic microenviron -\nment, suggesting new strategies for boosting hepatic T \ncell immunity.\nCONFERENCIA SAI III\nChairs: Dr. Fernando Chirdo y Dra.

The dialogue established \nbetween the tumor cells and the microenvironment, is an \nessential determinant of the characteristics of the tumor \nprogression.\nThe completion of the human genome sequence has \ngenerated great expectations in the development of new \ncancer therapies. However, considering the heterogene -\nity of most tumors, a single biomarker does not seem \nsufficient to predict the disease outcome. Furthermore, \nthe problem widens when analyzing and grading the ar -\nchitectural complexity of the epithelial structures. In this \nregard, innovative high-throughput \u201comics\u201d platforms are \nnow identifying and quantifying new specific and sensi -tive biomarkers for detection, stratification and treatment. \nAlthough some progress has been made, there is an ur -\ngent need to chart a coherent road map with clearly de -\nfine milestones to guide therapeutics efforts.\nHeme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1), the rate limiting enzyme in \nheme degradation, has been shown to govern a plethora \nof biological processes and molecular functions associ -\nated with anti-tumoral effects in several cancers, ranging \nfrom cell proliferation, invasion and migration impair -\nment, to exerting co-regulatory functions at the transcrip -\ntional level and preventing DNA damage. This evidences \nmultiple roles beyond its enzymatic activity. Particularly, \nfor the past decade, we have been evaluating using in \nvitro and in vivo models, its antitumoral role in prostate \ncancer (PCa). Thus, this presentation is intended to de -\nscribe the most pressing issues of HO-1 in PCa and sub -LECTURES23\nsequent progression, from its nuclear presence in cells, \nto its modulation of cell physiology and metabolism, its \nimpact on cellular architecture and its role in modifying \nthe tumoral microenvironment, favoring a less aggres -\nsive phenotype.\nAdvanced PCa exhibits bone dissemination as the pref -\nerable site for progression. Bone metastases are incur -\nable and only palliative treatments are available. Our \nrigorous approach has defined the participation of HO-1 on bone turn over  and  remodeling  and demonstrated  \nthat  its  modulation  on both, prostate tumor cells and \nbone cells, disrupts their communication altering the tu -\nmoral bone niche. A better understanding of how these \nprocesses influence the early onset of bone metastasis \ncan shed light into more tailored therapies. Overall, we \nclear provide sound evidence for HO-1\u2019s relevance as a \nkey homeostatic factor against the aggressive and met -\nastatic disease.\nCONFERENCIA SAIC IV\nChair: Dra.

In melanoma, genetic alterations in BRAF , es-\npecially the BRAFV600E mutation, are the most frequent \nactivating mutations, leading to Erk1/2 hyperactivation. \nInhibitors targeting the BRAFV600E mutation such as ve -\nmurafenib (VMF) have improved the survival of mela -\nnoma patients, especially when combined with MEK1/2 \ninhibitors including trametinib (TMT). Yet, melanoma \ntreatment with MAPK inhibitors (MAPKi) leads to an al -\nmost universal resistance leading to disease relapse. \nWhile genetic alterations such as NRAS mutations, \nchanges in BRAF splicing and BRAF amplification are \ncommon mechanisms involved in MAPKi resistance of \nmelanoma, non-genetic mechanisms of therapeutic re -\nsistance are now beginning to be unveiled. Linked to \ntheir high mutational burden, melanoma cells display \none of the strongest plasticity amongst cancers. Thus, \nit is well accepted that during the development of re -\nsistance, melanoma cells display several distinct popu -lations including drug-tolerant persistent cells that can \ncycle or stay non-cycling, while others show rapid high \nproliferative behavior representing the initial resistant \nsubset. Using combined in vitro  and in vivo  approach -\nes, we are investigating the non-genetic mechanisms in -\nvolved in resistance of melanoma cells to combined VMF \nand TMT treatment. To this end we are using BRAFV600E \nYUMM (Yale University Mouse Melanoma) mouse mela -\nnoma cells which can be inoculated into immunocompe -\ntent C57/BL6 mice. We have in vitro  generated several \nVMF/TMT-resistant YUMM cell lineages, and we have in \nvivo obtained different resistant YUMM cell populations \nwhich likely encompass drug-tolerant persistent and \nfast-appearing resistant cells. We are now biochemical -\nly, functionally and genetically comparing these resistant \nmelanoma cell populations, and we will identify the im -\nmune cell content within the microenvironment of these \ndifferent resistant tumors.

Increases in the size of myocytes as well as \nreprogramming of transcriptional toward fetal patterns, \nare hallmarks of the more lethal, pathological forms of \ncardiac hypertrophy. Transcriptional remodeling leads \nto impaired contractility, increased fibrosis and cardiac \nfailure with death. In the USA alone, inherited hypertro -\nphic cardiomyopathy affects one in five hundred individ -\nuals.  No treatment exists for preventing the onset of the \ndisease in individuals born with these causative muta -\ntions. Compared to healthy tissue, tissue from cardio -\nmyopathies has lower histone H3K4me3 and H3K9me3, \nwhile H4K20 methylation remains unchanged.  We have \nfound that the enzymes responsible for erasing histone tri-methylation, the Jumonji demethylases, are aberrant -\nly high in hypertrophic hearts, and their genetic deletion \nin mice prevents cardiac hypertrophy in response to \nmechanical overload blocking fibrotic gene expression. \nBased on this, we hypothesized that inhibition of cardi -\nac H3K4me3/H3K9me3 Jumonji demethylases would \nreverse transcriptional maladaptive reprogramming and \novercome/prevent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  We will \npresent genetic and pharmacological data defining the \nrole of Jumonji enzymes in the establishment of hypertro -\nphic cardiomyopathy and therapeutic studies of Jumonji \ndemethylase inhibitors that provide proof of principle for \ntranscriptional reprogramming, increased cardiac func -\ntion, improvement of arrythmias and prolongation of sur -\nvival from cardiac sudden death in disease models. \nCONFERENCIA SAI V\nChair: Dr. Pablo Baldi y Dr. Mart\u00edn Rumbo\nCONTROL OF IMMUNITY AND INFLAMMATION BY THE MICROBIOTA\nYasmine Belkaid\nLaboratory of Immune System Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health; \nNIAID Bethesda, Maryland\nabstract not available\nCONFERENCIA SAI DE CLAUSURA\nChairs: Dra.

While the \nnormal function of the host and viral phases creates a \nTat positive feedback loop facilitating viral replication, \nour studies indicate that dysfunction of the host phase \n(due to reduced host co-factor availability) blunts the vi -\nral phase thereby promoting latency establishment.

Why? \nThe highly lipophilic and basic nature of many these \nagents can cause phospholipidosis 1, as they accumulate \nmassively in cell membranes, and SARS-CoV-2 enters \nvia ACE2 and lipid rafts, then creates its lipid envelope in \nendoplasmic reticulum membranes. Thus agents such as \nchloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may work in vitro , \nbut are much less effective in vivo . Cell membrane lipids \n(sphingolipids) and sugars are critical for viral envelopes and for viral recognition and we have worked on spe -\ncific glycosphingolipids which are critical for age-related \ndiseases (Parkinson\u2019s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, \nALS) as they are neurotrophic, and the enzymes (gluco -\nsylceramidases) play major roles in disease progression \n2. Surprisingly they are also critical for envelope viruses \nentry and exit from cells, so the drugs we are developing \nfor ALS (ambroxol 3) are also to be tested in COVID-19. \nThe discovery of cheap generic drugs for COVID-19 to \naccompany vaccination is therefore a major goal, but \ndrug development needs to be carefully prioritized.\n1.

University of Buenos Aires. \nNational Scientific and Technical Research Council. Argentina. \nAmong the most intriguing observations in Coronavirus \ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) are the reduced incidence \nand mortality rates in children. In fact, and in contrast to \nother viral respiratory infections such as those caused \nby influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses, SARS-\nCoV-2 usually develops as a mild infection in children. \nThe reasons for this remain unclear. Considering that \npulmonary infiltration by neutrophils plays a relevant role \nin the development of severe COVID-19 in adults, we analyzed whether neutrophils in children infected with \nSARS-CoV-2 expressed a particular phenotypic profile. \nWe found that neutrophils from children with COVID-19 \nhad a distinct signature characterized by a reduced ex -\npression of adhesion molecules involved in neutrophil \nmigration together with an increased expression of both, \nthe inflammatory markers CD64, HLA-DR and PECAM-1 \nand the inhibitory receptors leukocyte-associated im -\nmunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR-1) and programmed MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 202128\ndeath-ligand 1 (PD-L1). This finding is unusual as neutro -\nphil activation is associated with the up-regulation of ad -\nhesion molecules as observed in adults with COVID-19. \nWe hypothesized that this particular signature might \nprevent neutrophil infiltration in the pulmonary capillaries \nthus providing protection against tissue injury in children.\nWhile the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is \nusually mild, some children develop severe COVID-19. It \nhas been shown that a severe disease in adults is linked \nto a delayed kinetic of antibody production. We also stud -\nied whether a defective antibody response could be as -\nsociated with a more severe condition in children. We \nfound that children with severe COVID-19 display a very poor and late antibody response against SARS-CoV-2. \nThis weak antibody response occurs due to a low fre -\nquency of circulating Follicular Helper T cells and a sys -\ntemic inflammatory response revealed by high levels of \ninflammatory cytokines in plasma. \nVaccines against COVID-19 have shown very high levels \nof safety and effectiveness. In countries where vaccina -\ntion was widely performed, such as in Israel and the Unit -\ned Kingdom, the infection rate in children is worsening. \nIn this scenario, it is urgent to characterize the factors \ndetermining the predisposition of some children to suffer \nsevere COVID-19. \nCOVID-19 AND PREGNANCY\nGil Mor\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wayne State University, Michigan, USA.\nabstract not available\nSIMPOSIO SAIC N\u00b01: GENERATION AND INTEGRATION OF NEURAL STEM CELLS IN SYNAPTIC \nCIRCUITS: IMPORTANCE IN NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS\nChair: Dr. Gustavo Paratcha\nLRIG1 CONTROLS NEURAL STEM CELL HOMEOSTASIS IN THE DEVELOPING CORTEX \nAna P De Vincenti, Gustavo Paratcha \nInstituto de Biolog\u00eda Celular y Neurociencias (IBCN)-CONICET-UBA, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA).\nThe cell-intrinsic mechanisms underlying the decision of \na stem/progenitor cell to either self-renew or differentiate \nare incompletely understood. Here, we show that Lrig1 \nis early expressed in the neocortex during the period \nof cortical neurogenesis. The majority of the progenitor \ncells expressing high levels of Lrig1 were negative for the \nproliferative marker Ki67, indicating that Lrig1 expression \nis inversely correlated with proliferation. In agreement \nwith this, we show that Lrig1 abrogates the self\u2013renew -\ning activity of cortical neural progenitor cells induced \nby mitogenic signals. Cortical progenitors derived from Lrig1-deficient mice give rise to an increased number \nand size of mitogen-induced neurospheres. Analysis of \nLrig1-deficient mice also shows a significant increase in \nthe number of cycling cells during cortical development \nin vivo. Notably, Lrig1 restricts proliferation of NPCs by \nregulating the expression levels of cyclins and cell-cycle \ninhibitors. Together, our results indicate that Lrig1 defi -\nciency triggers proliferation of cortical precursor cells and \nsuggest that Lrig1 may promote neural stem cell quies -\ncence.\nDENDRITIC REMODELING AND SYNAPTIC INTEGRATION OF ADULT-BORN HIPPOCAMPAL NEURONS\nAntonela Bonafina, Fernanda Ledda\nInstituto de Investigaciones Bioqu\u00edmicas de Buenos Aires (IIBBA)-CONICET-Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Leloir\nIn the mammalian adult hippocampus, new neurons are \ncontinuously generated throughout life in the subgranular \nzone of the dentate gyrus. Increasing evidence point out \nthe contribution of adult-born hippocampal granule cells \n(GCs) to cognitive processes such as learning and mem -\nory, indicating the relevance of understanding the molec -\nular mechanisms that control the development of these \nnew neurons in the preexisting hippocampal circuits. Cell \nproliferation and functional integration of adult-born GCs is a process highly regulated by different intrinsic and \nextrinsic factors. In this work, we described a novel role \nof the Glial Derived Neurotrophic Factor, GDNF, acting \nthrough its GFR a1 receptor in the control of dendritic \nstructure and spine density of adult-born granule cells. \nOur findings reveals that GFR a1 is required for the inte -\ngration of the new born neurons into preexisting circuits \nand for spatial memory processing.SYMPOSIA29\nNOVEL ROLE OF THE SYNAPTIC SCAFFOLD PROTEIN DLGAP4 IN THE VENTRICULAR SURFACE \nINTEGRITY AND NEURONAL MIGRATION DURING CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT \nDelfina M.

De Robertis\u201d (IBCN), \nBuenos Aires, Argentina. \nSubcortical heterotopias are malformations associated \nwith epilepsy and intellectual disability, characterized \nby the presence of ectopic neurons in the white matter. \nMouse and human heterotopia mutations were identified \nin the microtubule-binding protein Echinoderm microtu -\nbule-associated protein-like 1, EML1. Further exploring \npathological mechanisms, we identified a patient with an \nEML1-like phenotype and a novel genetic variation in DL-\nGAP4 . The protein belongs to a membrane-associated \nguanylate kinase family known to function in glutamate \nsynapses. We show that DLGAP4 is strongly expressed \nin the mouse ventricular zone (VZ) from early corticogen -\nesis, and interacts with key VZ proteins including EML1. In utero  electroporation of Dlgap4 knockdown (KD) and \noverexpression constructs revealed a ventricular surface \nphenotype including changes in progenitor cell dynam -\nics, morphology, proliferation and neuronal migration \ndefects. The Dlgap4 KD phenotype was rescued by wild-\ntype but not mutant DLGAP4. Dlgap4 is required for the \norganization of radial glial cell adherens junction com -\nponents and actin cytoskeleton dynamics at the apical \ndomain, as well as playing a critical role during neuronal \nmigration. We hence identify a synapse-related scaffold \nprotein with pleiotropic functions in the telencephalic \nneuroepithelium, influencing the overall integrity of the \ndeveloping cerebral cortex.\nFROM NEURAL PROGENITORS TO A NOVEL BIOLOGICAL TOOL \nTO UNDERSTAND SCHIZOPHRENIA PATHOPHYSIOLOGY\nDiego Gelman\nInstituto de Biolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental (IBYME\u2013CONICET)\nA wide diversity of cortical interneurons is generated from \nthe subpallial region of the developing telencephalon by \na combinatorial expression of transcription factors in a \nprecise spatiotemporal program. Most cortical interneu -\nrons are derived from the medial ganglionic eminence, \nthat specifies both somatostatin and parvalbumin inter -\nneurons. It has been shown that fast spiking parvalbumin \ninterneurons are affected in schizophrenia patients, a \nfact that supports the GABAergic hypothesis of the dis -\nease. An inaccurate developmental program of parval -\nbumin interneurons may contribute to the emergence of \npsychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia. Dopamine \nD2 receptors promotes the inhibitory activity of parval -\nbumin interneurons, especially during the transition be -\ntween adolescence to adulthood. The dopaminergic hy -\npothesis of schizophrenia is the most perdurable in the \nfield and postulates an imbalance in the dopaminergic \ntone between cortical and subcortical regions. Moreover, \nthe main pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia, \nantipsychotics, targets dopamine D2 receptors.In a converging hypothesis between GABAergic and do -\npaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia, we generated a \nmice line that lacks dopamine D2 receptors exclusively \nfrom parvalbumin interneurons. Selective dopamine D2 \nreceptor deletion causes an impaired inhibitory activity in \nthe ventral hippocampus and a dysregulated dopaminer -\ngic system. Conditional mutant animals show adult onset \nof schizophrenia-like behaviors. Prefrontal cortex, stria -\ntum and ventral hippocampus recapitulates cellular, mo -\nlecular and physiological endophenotypes as previously \ndescribed from post-mortem brain studies. Aripiprazole \ntreatment, a widely used antipsychotic, revealed that a \nfunctional dopamine D2 receptor is required on parval -\nbumin interneurons to regain normal locomotor activity.\nThe absence of a functional dopamine D2 receptor sig -\nnaling promoting the inhibitory activity of parvalbumin \ninterneurons may drive an excessive dopaminergic neu -\nrotransmission and an aberrant adult neuronal circuit, \nleading to schizophrenia-like phenotypes. A complete \nunderstanding of parvalbumin interneuron developmen -MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

It has become clear that \nresolution of inflammation is an active process driven by \nmolecules collectively known as mediators of resolution. \nThese molecules include lipid mediadores (eg. lipoxin A4), \nproteins (eg. annexin-A1, plasmin); peptides (eg. angioten -\nsin 1-7) and other molecules, such as Short Chain fatty ac -\nids and Hydrogen peroxide. In the context of infection, we \nhave found that pro-resolving mediators, in general, have \na tissue protective effect and do not interfere with the abil -ity of the murine host to deal with infection. For example, \ntreatment with Angio 1-7 or lipoxin A4 analogues decreased \npulmonary inflammation and disease severity in mice. In an \nattempt to study this concept in humans, we evaluated the \neffects of a pro-resolving molecule, a melanocortin agonist, \nin COVID-19 patients with moderate disease in a phase 2 \ntrial with 60 patients. We found that the melanocortin ago -\nnist decreased time to respiratory recovery and hospital -\nization. This is the first proof of concept study showing that \npro-resolving molecules may be beneficial for humans, a \ntenet that clearly deserves further investigation.

We investigated the role of IL17A and IFNG during \nthe autophagy process in monocytes from tuberculosis \n(TB) patients infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis  \n(Mtb) H37Rv strain. TB patients were classified as high \nresponder (HR) or low responder (LR) according to their \nT cell responses against Mtb. IL17A augmented auto -\nphagy in infected monocytes from HR patients through \na mechanism that activated MAPK1/ERK2-MAPK3/\nERK1 but, during infection of monocytes from LR pa -\ntients, IL17A had no effect on the autophagic response. \nIn contrast, addition of IFNG to infected monocytes, in -\ncreased autophagy by activating MAPK14/p38\u03b1 both \nin HR and LR patients, promoting mycobacterial killing. \nBesides the crucial function of cytokines, different lipid \nmediators are critical in the resolution of mycobacterial \ninfection. However, very limited information regarding \nthe PGE2 pathway in TB patients is available. We de -\ntected elevated plasmatic PGE2 levels in patients with \ndecreased T cell responses against Mtb (LR) in compari -\nson with individuals who show efficient anti-mycobacteria \nT cell responses (HR). Furthermore, PGE2 displayed a significant suppressive effect on cell proliferation. Ad -\nditionally, PGE2 significantly decreased the production \nof proinflammatory cytokines. Our findings suggested a \nsuppressive/regulatory role for PGE2 on the innate and \nadaptive immune responses of the human host against \nMtb. However, different roles for PGE2 during Mtb infec -\ntion has been described. In fact, PGE2 has been pro -\nposed as a host-directed treatment to counteract the \npredominant type I interferon response displayed by se -\nvere TB patients. In this context, autophagy arises as a \npotential mechanism that may explain the positive role of \nPGE2 during the early stages of Mtb infection. Interest -\ningly, we observed that PGE2 treatment augmented the \npercentage of CD14+LC3A, B-II+ monocytes and LC3A, \nB-II+ neutrophils upon Mtb-Ag stimulation. Then, PGE2 \nreduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines but \npromoted autophagy in TB patients\u00b4 cells cultured with \nMtb, suggesting that PGE2 might be attenuating the ex -\ncessive inflammatory immune response caused by Mtb. \nTogether, our findings contribute to the knowledge of the \nrole of inflammatory mediators in the human host resis -\ntance to Mtb and highlight their potential as tools to im -\nprove anti-TB treatment.MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Trevani\nIMEX-CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina\nNeutrophils are the most numerous leukocytes in human \ncirculation. They are rapid and massively recruited to \ninfection foci to fight against the potentially harmful ag -\ngressors. Their mission is fulfilled by employing an array \nof antimicrobial weapons that includes proteases, micro -\nbicidal peptides, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). \nThese granulocytes also contribute to the immune re -\nsponse by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators. How -\never, they are double-edged swords of innate immunity \nbecause their inappropriate or dysregulated activation \nalso contributes to the development of inflammatory and \nautoimmune diseases. \nWe have demonstrated that human neutrophils produce \nand release the potent pro-inflammatory mediator Inter -\nleukin-1-beta (IL-1\u03b2). This cytokine is synthesized as a \nprecursor (pro-IL-1\u03b2) that is proteolytically processed to \nan active isoform and then released. As pro-IL-1\u03b2 is a leaderless protein, it is synthesized in the cytosol. Our \nstudies showed that an unconventional autophagy-medi -\nated secretory pathway mediates neutrophil IL-1\u03b2 secre -\ntion. We also demonstrated that NADPH oxidase-derived \nROS are crucial for IL-1\u03b2 exportation. Our recent findings \nindicated that even though caspase-1 is required for neu -\ntrophil IL-1\u03b2 secretion, it does not play a central role in \npro-IL-1\u03b2 processing, being the serine proteases, the en -\nzymes involved in accomplishing this function. Altogeth -\ner, our studies reveal distinctive features of the regulation \nof IL-1\u03b2 secretion in human neutrophils. They also unveil \nnew molecular targets that might be employed for the ra -\ntional design of new therapies to control inflammation in \nthose pathologies where neutrophil-derived IL-1\u03b2 plays \na key pathogenic role, without compromising broad host \ndefense against pathogens.  \nROLE OF EPITHELIAL AND STROMAL CELLS IN PROSTATIC INFLAMMATION\nAmado A.

From the classical \ndescription of \u201cthe prostatic antibacterial factor,\u201d many \nhost defense proteins with potent microbicidal, proinflam -\nmatory and anti-tumoral activities have been reported in \nresident cells, i.e. epithelial and smooth muscle cells, \nduring the prostatic response against injuries. However, \nthese cells also represent the target of the inflammatory \ndamage, leading to the development of a Proliferative \nInflammatory Atrophy-like process in the epithelium and \na myofibroblastic-like reactive stroma. Consequently, \nprostatitis has been proposed to play a pivotal role in the \npathophysiology of the two more prevalent conditions be -\nnign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.\nAvailable information indicates that both prostate ep -\nithelium and stroma express fully CD14, TLRs, inflam -\nmasomes and other recognition receptors, being able to \nmount and coordinate the inflammatory and immune re -\nsponses afterwards. This is particularly important as the \ntriggers of prostatic inflammation include not only patho -\ngens but also autoimmune, mechanical, hormonal, or neuronal factors. For instance, the uric acid from the re -\nflux and influx of sterile urine induces a NALP3-cas1-de -\npendent inflammatory reaction in experimental models of \nprostatitis.\nAs the prostate gland is a strictly androgen-dependent \norgan whose function is to protect haploid gametes, host \ndefenses and immunity of the gland have unique fea -\ntures in order to maintain a constant balance between \nresponse and tolerance to diverse antigens. In this con -\ntext, epithelial cells secrete, in an androgen-dependent \nmanner, numerous proteins with immunomodulatory ac -\ntivities, which favor the presence of specific regulatory \nphenotypes of inflammatory cells in the prostate. This \nanti-inflammatory/immunoregulatory effect of androgens \nis also observed on prostatic smooth muscle cells, where \nthe inflammatory response to endotoxins is dampened \nin the presence of physiological doses of testosterone. \nHowever, it would be too simplistic to ascribe a specific \nsuppressive role to androgens on prostatic inflammation, \nwith these effects being complex and have just started to \nbe defined.

Nac. de Quilmes (UNQ)\nThe incidence of infectious diseases grows at an expo -\nnential rate each year and has a direct correlation with \nhigh rates of morbidity and mortality. One of the most \nfrequent infections worldwide are respiratory tract infec -\ntions, with an increasing number being associated with \nthe ability of bacteria to adapt to the environment and \ndifferent types of antimicrobial compounds. Improved \ntreatment requires the development of new therapeutic \nstrategies.\nThe inhalation route maximizes pulmonary concentra -\ntions and optimizes therapeutic success while minimiz -\ning systemic exposure and adverse events. The use of \ninhaled antimicrobial therapy has become an important \npart of the treatment of airway infection with Pseudomo -\nnas aeruginosa  in cystic fibrosis (CF) and similar con -\nditions. However, this therapy frequently fails to eradi -\ncate the infection due to the combination of the complex \npathophysiology of lung disease, antibiotic-resistant pathogens and biofilm formation. \nInhalable nanomedicines improve drug delivery and ther -\napeutic efficacy by enhancing drug retention at the site of \naction, mitigating effects of clearance mechanisms and \ndegradation, and reducing necessary dosage and fre -\nquency, which leads to greater patient compliance and \noutcomes. However, to date only one antibiotic-nano -\nmedicine for inhaled administration has entered the mar -\nket, mainly due to diverse obstacles limiting their imple -\nmentation.\nIn this talk the obstacles that inhalable nanomedicines \nmust overcome to be effective in pulmonary bacterial \ninfections will be discussed, as well as examples of in -\nhalable nanomedicines in development.

In the \nface of newly infectious organisms and the global crisis in \nantibiotic resistance, there is a need to invigorate the ba -\nsic science and technology of antimicrobial development. \nMethods: This work, describes different engineering ap -\nproaches to resolve some of the challenges in antibiotic \ndevelopment. \nResults: A first approach successfully allowed the po -\ntentiation of current antibiotics using novel and naturally \nexisting therapeutic adjuvants (silver and supplementary \nmetallic micronutrients) based on a better understanding \nof the mechanisms of infectious disease, a comprehen -\nsion of microbe-therapeutic biochemical interactions as \nwell as the microbial genetic responses to therapeutics. A \nsecond approach allowed us to design an intelligent and endogenous antimicrobial therapeutic using the interface \nof Nanotechnology and Synthetic Biology. The final ap -\nproach involved the design of microbial ecologies that in -\ncite a competition environment between different micro -\norganisms. This last approach describes an innovative \nmechanism to discover antimicrobial molecules through \nthe identification of fruitful competitive biochemical in -\nteractions between a set of microorganisms in synthetic \nand natural ecologies. Through microbial competition we \ndiscovered a novel antimicrobial exopolysaccharide with \napplications not only as a therapeutic agent but also as a \ndelivery system of other therapeutic agents.\nConclusions:\nTogether, the results here described will play an import -\nant role in the future development of antimicrobial agents \nand treatments against infections. In addition, the thera -\npeutic designs proposed here will prevent and contribute \ntoward the decrease in antimicrobial resistant of existing \nstrains.MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

X5000HUA C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina.\nIt is well known in life science that integrating knowl -\nedge, methods and techniques from different disciplines \nis the key to tackle many open problems. Multidiscipline \ndefinitely offers a future beyond imagination, with many \ndifficulties and challenges that deserve to deal with to \nachieve innovations and moving then to people. \nIn the physics of life, micro-nanofabrication techniques \nhave been extensively used. In particular microfluidics, \nwhere small is better , an area nowadays more affordable \nthanks to years of nanotechnology growth. Advantages \nof its applications are precision, control, small volumes, \nlow cost-energy, fast-processes, green-credentials, por -\ntability (POC). In reproductive medicine, microfluidics \nis just starting to bring new interesting ideas to the field \n[NatureRev2017] , and the road is long to see innovations \nused in clinics and home. \nWe work with labs on a chip (LOC) for different micros -\nwimmers. Under control in laboratory, microdevices \nhad been essential to characterize bacteria and sperm \nmotility. For first, we propose, model and achieve a hu -\nman sperm rectifier, sperm-diode/sperm-microratchet \n[PRE2014]  that small that you can handle it at the point of \none finger. We were able to generate a spermatic current simply designing an asymmetrical biocompatible device \nand taking advantage of the preferential cell swimming \nalong surfaces. This was possible thanks to bio-obser -\nvations and to apply physical concepts. Such physical \nsperm-transport, free of DNA damage, gives place to \ncell concentration needed for analysis and selection.  It \nwas the first step to recent developments for more effi -\ncient in-vitro reproduction methods. We went further in \napplications, improving counting cell devices, where in \nopposite, the sperm accumulation close to walls is det -\nrimental. For clinical fertility analysis, we proposed me -\nliorations corrugating borders, to the daily used Makler \nchamber [Biomicrofluidics2015] . In this talk more details \nand scope of our multidisciplinary achievements will be \npresented. Even more recently we have reported an \nunexpected human sperm velocity recovery under ul -\ntraconfined conditions, with a nice agreement between \nmodel and experiments [Biomicrofluidics2020][Scilight].  \nWe propose a model of the sperm motility, including cells \nlateral heading and torque that aligns them close to the \nwalls which we hope be useful to predict and design, \neven more accurate, miniaturized, portable and low cost \nmicrodevices for reproductive medicine. \nSIMPOSIO SAI N\u00b0 2: TISSUE SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSE I\nChairs: Dra.

Several waves of functionally defined sub -\nsets of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells develop very early in the fetal thymus. \nThese show limited clonal diversity and can acquire their \neffector functions already in the thymus, thereby support -\ning the idea that some \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are literally innate T \ncells. For example, IL-17-producing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells express -\ning invariant V\u03b36+ TCRs are prominent examples of such \ninnate effector \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in mice. These V\u03b36+ T cells \nare long-lived and self-renewing in a number of periph -\neral tissues, where they adopt tissue-specific effector \nphenotypes and fulfill tissue-specific functions includ -ing immune responses to pathogens. Recent evidence \nsuggested that the human fetal thymus also produces \nlong-lived innate effector \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. In particular, some \nsemi-invariant phosphoantigen-reactive V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells \nmay develop as type-1 and type-3 effector T cells already \nin the first trimester of pregnancy, and then expand after \nbirth and persist in tissues into adulthood.\nOn the other hand, we found that TCR repertoires of non-\nV\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells are extremely diverse, and usually do not \noverlap between individual donors. Notably, monitoring \n\u03b3\u03b4 TCR repertoires in patients undergoing hematopoietic \nstem cell transplantation provided evidence for adaptive \nanti-viral immune responses of human V\u03b41+ T cells.\nOur current projects aim at monitoring the dynamics of \u03b3\u03b4 \nTCR repertoires and phenotypes during ontogeny and in SYMPOSIA35\nresponse to microbial exposure. To this end, we recently \nestablished a protocol for combined single-cell RNA- and \nTCR-sequencing. This allows us to track the immune response of individual \u03b3\u03b4 T cell clones, for example in \nbirth cohorts or when analyzing longitudinal samples of \npatients showing CMV-reactivation after transplantation.  \nLAG-3, TIM-3 AND TIGIT: CO-INHIBITORY RECEPTORS IN CHAGAS HEART DISEASE\nPaula Alcar\u00e1z, F\u00e1tima Ferragut, Gonzalo R.

In \nfact, the frequency of cells with reduced effector capabil -\nities has been directly correlated to cardiac compromise; \nwhile contrariwise, the presence of polyfunctional T cells \nshows association with therapeutic success.\nAlthough programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and \ncytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) \nwere the pioneer inhibitory receptors to be studied in re -\nlation to T cell exhaustion, other molecules were demon -\nstrated to complement their function in a lower hierar -\nchical level, apparently enabling the fine-tuning of T cell inhibition. Among these molecules, T cell immunorecep -\ntor with Ig and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory \nmotif (ITIM) domains T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM do -\nmain (TIGIT),  lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) and \nT cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 \n(TIM-3) ) have been found to be implicated in chronic \ninfections, and arise as promising targets for immune-en -\nhancing therapies. This talk will focus primarily on the \nrole of these inhibitory receptors in peripheral blood CD4+ \nT cells from CCD patients in relation to T. cruzi -specific \nand non-antigen-specific activation, and how their block -\nade impact in the functional capacity of CD4+ T cells in \nthe different stage of the disease.\nSIMPOSIO NANOMED-AR-NANOMEDICINE II: ARGENTINE NANOTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS \nAGAINST COVID-19\nChairs: Dra.

Comerci\nInstituto de Investigaciones Biotecnol\u00f3gicas \u201cDr. Rodolfo Ugalde\u201d. IIB-UNSAM-CONICET\nIn December 2019, a beta-coronavirus called SARS- Cov \n2 emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, causing an out -\nbreak of unusual and severe bilateral pneumonia. The \nvirus managed to spread rapidly, expanding westward \nwith a high contagion rate, unleashing the most import -\nant pandemic of the last hundred years. This generated \na collapse not only in health systems but also in interna -\ntional trade, cutting the supply chain of medical supplies. \nThe first official case registered in our country occurred \nat the beginning of March 2020. Faced with this scenar -\nio, our laboratory presented a proposal to the National \nExecutive Power for the development and manufacture \nof molecular diagnostic tests and columns for RNA purifi -\ncation, two critical inputs necessary to meet the growing \ndemand of the national diagnostic network. Thanks to the \nfinancing of the Corporaci\u00f3n Andina de Fomento (CAF), \nwe established a public-private consortium between IIB-\nUNSAM, the UNQ molecular biology laboratory, and the \ncompanies Productos Bio-L\u00f3gicos SA and Chemtest SA \nwho contributed their human and technical resources, \nand administrative capacities to carry out the task. The \nconsortium with the collaboration of different dependen -\ncies of the National State brought from China the critical supplies for the development and production of 700,000 \nmanual and automated RNA purification kits that were \ndistributed throughout the country. Also, an isothermal \namplification method of viral genetic material followed by \ndetection of nucleic acid by lateral flow immunochromato -\ngraphic assay (NALFIA) was developed. The kit, called \nELA-CHEMSTRIP, combines bio and nano components \ndeveloped and manufactured entirely in the country, al -\nlowing the detection of the viral genetic material present \nin a swab sample with a detection limit, sensitivity, and \ndiagnostic specificity equivalent to RT-PCR but without \nthe need for sophisticated thermal cyclers. This technol -\nogy made it possible to decentralize the COVID 19 diag -\nnosis and implement it even in rural areas where there \nwas no infrastructure for molecular diagnosis. In this way, \nwe took advantage of a unique historical opportunity that \nallowed us to articulate actions and capacities of both \nthe public and private sectors, converging on a common \ngoal. The challenge for the future is to expand and con -\nsolidate these capacities to generate positive feedback \nthat enables the development of a national biotechnology \nindustry facing the challenges of the 21st century.MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Similar situations \noccurred in the past, although not as dramatic as in the \ncase of COVID-19 (for example, the outbreak of avian flu \nH1N1 in 2009). The development of efficient materials for \nmaking facemasks accessible to all countries is neces -\nsary to provide physicians and paramedics in particular, \nand the general public, with adequate protection against \nairborne pathogens.\nNon-woven polypropylene fabrics produced by differ -\nent processes as meltblown, spunbond and others, are \nconsidered as appropriate materials for the confection \nof facemasks. The protection provided by these mate -\nrials is a consequence of the filtration capability and the \npresence of electrostatic charges that repel or attract the \npathogens, blocking the passage through the mesh. For \nnon-medical uses, the combination of nonwovens with \ncotton (or other) fabrics provides reasonable protec -\ntion due to the combination of filtration and electrostatic \ncharges.\nThe incorporation of additives with antiviral and antibac -terial activity at the surface of fabric fibers is a strate -\ngy to increase the protection provided by the mask. \nThroughout use, microbes accumulate on the surface of \nthe mask, increasing the likelihood of self-contamination. \nThis problem is even worse when people without spe -\ncial training use the mask. The presence of antimicrobial \nagents at the fibers prevents the accumulation of viable \npathogens. Silver and copper ions display well-known \nantibacterial and antiviral properties. Its use dates to an -\ncient civilizations, being robust and affordable. Working \nat the nanoscale, allows great effects with a very low \namount of the active agents.\nCu(II) ions were incorporated at different polypropylene \nnon-woven fabrics, using polyvinyl alcohol as matrix to \ncontain and fix the additives. Different formulations and \ndrying conditions were applied. The effect of the hydro -\nphilicity and density (GSM) of the fabric on the mesh \n(filtration capabilities was determined). The antibacterial \nactivity of selected samples in terms of copper content \nwas determined. A mask prototype was made with two \ntypes of non-woven fabrics additioned with copper ions.\nDNA NANOVACCINE AGAINST SARS-CoV-2\nAna Clara Mignaqui1, Romanela Marcellino1, Federica Ghersa1, Joaqu\u00edn Faraldo2, Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Carignano2, \nVer\u00f3nica Tatsch2, Augusto Pich Otero2, Eduardo De La Puente2 y Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Pappalardo1. \n1Grupo de Nanomedicina Veterinaria, EEA Bariloche, Instituto Nacional de Tecnolog\u00eda Agropecuaria.

In this context, \nat the Veterinary Nanomedicine Group, we were plan -\nning preclinical studies in mice to evaluate a candidate \nnanovaccine against caseous lymphadenitis, a zoonotic \ndisease that affects sheep, among other species, in the \nPatagonian region. \nA question then arose in the group: would it be possi -\nble to use our Nanovaccine Platform to contribute to the \ndevelopment of a vaccine candidate to respond to this \npandemic? We contacted Laboratorios Bag\u00f3 S.A. and \nafter discussing it, we decided to try this together. Then, \na Research and Development agreement was signed be -\ntween both parts, that provided the funds to advance with \nthe experiments. The agreement was structured in stag -\nes that would be implemented according to the results. \nThe first stage was a proof of concept of the technology, \nevaluating the humoral immune response in mice, using \nour platform to carry plasmid DNA encoding for the Re -\nceptor Binding Domain (RBD) region of the Spike protein \nof SARS-CoV-2. The results were very encouraging and \nprompted us to move forward. We are currently carrying out the end of Stage 2, which will allow us to evaluate two \nimportant aspects of the vaccine: On the one hand, we will \nstudy the ability of the vaccine to generate immunological \nmemory, that is, an immune cell mediated memory that \nallows the vaccinated animal to \u201cremember\u201d the pathogen \nand trigger a fast immune response that protects it from \nthe disease. On the other hand, we will evaluate the safe -\nty of the vaccine candidate, that is, if the vaccine is toxic \nor generates an adverse effect in laboratory animals.\nThis vaccine is based on rationally designed liposomes \ntargeted to dendritic cells (DC), carrying plasmid DNA \nmolecules encoding RBD (proprietary technologic plat -\nform). Targeting is done via DC-SIGN present on DC, \nand a targeting molecule decorating the liposomes. This \nsynthetic molecule is novel and is based on pathogen-as -\nsociated molecular patterns, meaning it can target DC of \ndifferent species, since, unlike monoclonal antibodies, it \nis a species-non-specific molecule, which allows its use \nboth in animal health as human health. DC are key cells \nof the immune system, therefore directing the vaccine \nload towards them significantly increases the efficacy \nof the vaccine, since these cells will express the SARS-\nCoV-2 antigens and trigger the immune response.SYMPOSIA37\nSIMPOSIO SAI N\u00b0 3 GUILLERMINA FELDMAN: CLINICAL FEATURES, IMMUNOPATHOGENESIS AND \nTHERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES IN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES\nChairs: Dra.

C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina.\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory \ndisease characterized by progressive joint destruction \nassociated with increased pro-inflammatory mediators. \nB cells play an important role in the development and \nmaintenance of RA. Although IL-10-producing B cells \nrepresent a major subset of regulatory B cells (Bregs) \nable to suppress autoimmune and inflammatory respons -\nes, recent reports showed that B cell-mediated immune \nsuppression may also occur independent of IL-10. Inter -\nestingly, in inflammatory microenvironments, exogenous \nATP (eATP) is hydrolyzed to adenosine, which exerts im -\nmunosuppressive effects, by the consecutive action of \nthe ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73. In this direction, \nmature B cells constitutively express CD39 and CD73. \nAdditionally, B cells also express the inhibitory molecule \nPD-L1. All the mentioned molecules convert B cells to \npotential suppressors.\nWe evaluated the frequency of PD-L1- or CD39+- ex -\npressing B cells in the peripheral blood of RA patients compared to healthy controls (HC) matched for sex and \nage. Fresh peripheral blood B cells from RA patients and \nHC were characterized by flow cytometry and their func -\ntionality assessed in a co-culture system with autologous \nT cells.  Our results show that PD-L1+ B cells exhibiting \nT cell suppressive capacity are significantly decreased in \nuntreated RA patients but increase in response to suc -\ncessful treatment. Moreover, we determined that B cells \nfrom untreated RA patients conserved CD39-mediated \nregulatory function. Good responder patients to therapy \nexhibited an increased CD39 expression on B cells af -\nter treatment, while most of the non-responder patients \nshowed a reduction in this ectoenzyme expression. The \npositive changes of CD39 expression on B cells exhibited \na negative correlation with disease activity and rheuma -\ntoid factor levels. Our results suggest modulating B regs \nand PD-L1-PD-1and the ectoenzymes/ADO pathways as \na potential therapy target for improving the course of RA.\nSIMPOSIO SAIC N\u00b02: TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH IN ONCOLOGY: PRECLINICAL, CLINICAL AND \nHEALTHCARE APPROACHES\nChairs: Dra.

Rozados\nInstituto de Gen\u00e9tica Experimental, Facultad de Ciencias M\u00e9dicas, Universidad Nacional de Rosario\nIn the field of cancer therapeutics, in spite of the great \nadvances accomplished during the last 25 years, which \nmeant the avoidance of millions of cancer-related deaths, \nlots of people continue to die from cancer, a fact that indi -\ncates the need to search for new therapeutic approach -\nes. Based on that need, we have been working for more \nthan 20 years, aiming to achieve three important goals \nthat are, in our opinion, equally important, namely: thera -\npeutic efficacy, good quality of life and, economic viabili -\nty, a situation that is not the case at present.\nIn order to fulfill those objectives we adopted and devel -\noped two proposals that posed a shift in paradigms relat -\ned to cancer therapeutics: i) metronomic chemotherapy \nthat consists in the chronic administration, at regular in -tervals, of low doses of chemotherapeutic drugs, without \nextended rest periods. This proposal defies the prevail -\ning paradigm: the higher the dose the better, which tends \nto be changed for this one: less is more when adminis -\ntered chronically; ii) repurposing drugs in oncology that \ninvolves the repositioning of drugs that are already well \nknown and characterized, and were created for other \nuses, to be utilized in oncology, which also suggests a \nparadigm shift. From the prevailing: one drug, one target, \none illness to the new one: one drug, several targets, \nseveral illnesses.\nOur work was mainly focused on triple negative mam -\nmary tumors, an aggressive subtype of cancer with poor \nprognosis and less therapeutic options.

Moreover, in \norder to facilitate the future translation of the results into \nthe clinic, we tried to mimic the clinical situation. Thus, \nwe imposed several characteristics to our experimental \nwork such as the use of immune competent animals and syngeneic tumor models, the administration of treatment \nafter tumor development, which is given for the most \npart per os, and the thorough study of its toxicity. One of \nthe drugs combinations was translated to the clinic in a \nphase II clinical trial which showed therapeutic efficacy, \nlack of grade 3 and 4 toxicities, and enabled the identifi -\ncation of early predictors of response. Also, in an ongo -\ning clinical trial for pancreas cancer, we are testing other \nrepositioned drug.\nCLINICAL AND PREVENTIVE ASPECTS IN ONCOLOGY TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH\nMarina Antelo, Marcela Carballido, Soledad Iseas, Ana Oviedo, Juli\u00e1n Maqueira, Juan Robbio, Giuliana Testa, Daniel \nCisterna, Ana Cabanne, Mirta Kujaruk, Guillermo Mendez, Enrique Roca, Mariano Golubicki\nSecci\u00f3n Oncolog\u00eda, Hospital de Gastroenterolog\u00eda \u201cDr. C. B. Udaondo\u201d\nOncological gastroenterology has grown enormously in \nthese years, with new fields still in full growth such as \ndigestive cancer hereditary syndromes. The scientific \ncommunity specially dedicated to diagnosis, treatment \nand prevention of hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) has \ngained the greatest strength inside this relatively new sub -\nspecialty, being Lynch syndrome (LS) the most frequent \ndisease. Its recognition in every new patient with CRC \nis essential because annual surveillance colonoscopies \nand total hysterectomy drastically reduce the mortality \nrelated to cancer in these patients, and because iden -\ntification of the causal mutation in one of the LS genes \nleads to genetic presymptomatic diagnosis in relatives, \nfocusing screening measures on mutation carriers. And \nalmost equally important, the recognition of CRC with \nmismatch repair (MMR) deficiency, the hallmark of this \ndisease, renders these patients with advanced disease \nas candidates for PD-1 blockade-based immunotherapy \nwith significantly better survival than patients with MMR \nproficient CRC. \nAccompanying this subspecialty growth, a Hereditary \nCRC Registry was created in 2008 in the Oncology Sec -\ntion of the Hospital of Gastroenterology \u201cDr. C. B. Ud -aondo\u201d, at Buenos Aires, with actually more than 1000 \npatients registered. During the last 13 years, Oncology, \nPathology and Molecular Biology have worked interdisci -\nplinary to set up the various molecular and pathological \ntests for LS diagnosis: immunohistochemistry for MMR \nproteins, microsatellite instability, BRAF V600E muta -\ntions, MLH1 somatic methylation, point mutations for in -\ndex patient\u00b4s relatives, and next generation sequencing \nof a cancer multi-gene panel, with a parallel constitution \nof a Molecular Biology Laboratory.

Chantada\nInstituto de Investigaciones en Medicina Traslacional (IIMT), Universidad Austral-CONICET\nTranslational research in pediatric oncology is a necessi -\nty in middle income countries (MIC) in order to carry out \nresearch programs of interest for this subset of countries \nwhere many of the world\u2019s children live. Since we face \nparticular problems, mostly delayed diagnosis, advanced \ndisease and higher toxicity of treatments used in high in -\ncome countries, obtaining results adapted to the reality \nof MIC is essential. However, there are many limitations \nfor translational research in MIC such as limited funding, \nscant interest from the private sector, insufficient support \nat hospitals and limited training of health care personnel. \nNevertheless, there are many examples of successful \nMIC-oriented translational research programs in Argen -\ntina.Our experience was based on two programs dealing with \ntwo pediatric tumors (neuroblastoma, the most common \nand fatal pediatric solid tumor) and retinoblastoma (an \nocular tumor selected as a priority by the WHO global \nprogram). In both cases, there was a strong and fruit -\nful partnership between hospitals and academic centers \nand in the former a public-private partnership including \na local pharma company was also a critical part. In the \ncase of retinoblastoma, international collaboration and \nfunding through non-governmental organizations was \nessential. In neuroblastoma, our group carried out a \nrepurposing program of an anti-idiotype vaccine (raco -\ntumomab) against a ganglioside target. After validating \nthe expression of the target in neuroblastoma, a first-in-SYMPOSIA39\nchildren phase 1 study was completed and published \nand an intention-to-file phase 2 study has been just com -\npleted accrual, recruiting patients with neuroblastoma \nfrom 4 countries in Latin America. The drug proved to be \nnon-toxic and effective in generating immune response \nand may be considered for further pivotal clinical studies. \nIn the case of retinoblastoma, the group identified a mo -\nlecular biomarker, useful for the determination of tumor \ndissemination which was helpful to design an ongoing prospective clinical protocol. The group also collaborat -\ned in the genomic and transcriptomic characterization of \nmetastatic retinoblastoma and patient-derived cell lines \nand xenografts were developed. High throughput screen -\ning for new agents identified innovative drug combina -\ntions. In both cases, the studies were also helpful for the \ntraining of researchers and improving local capacity for \nclinical care and laboratory diagnosis of these tumors.\nPREVENTION OF CERVICAL CANCER IN ARGENTINA, CONTRIBUTIONS \nFROM IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE\nSilvina Arrossi1, Victoria Sanchez Antelo2, Melisa Paolino1\n1. Centro de Estudios de Estado y Sociedad/Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CEDES/CONICET)\n2. Centro de Estudios de Estado y Sociedad (CEDES)\nCervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer \ndeath among women in Argentina.  Human papilloma -\nvirus (HPV) screening allows for self-collection with po -\ntential to reduce barriers to screening and increase cov -\nerage. Implementation science was used to introduce \nand evaluate performance and implementation of HPV \nself-collection in Argentina. Main questions were:  Would \nit be acceptable for women? Would it be effective to in -\ncrease screening uptake? What were main challenges \nassociated with the strategy when scaled-up?\nHPV self-collection was introduced in Argentina through \nthe EMA Project, a mix method study carried out in the \nprovince of Jujuy: it included a pragmatic cluster ran -\ndomized trial and qualitative research to evaluate ac -\nceptability and adoption by different stakeholders.  The \nstudy showed that HPV self-collection offered to women \nby community health workers (CHWs) during home vis -\nits was accepted by women and health providers, and \nit resulted in a four-fold difference in screening uptake \nbetween arms. Between 2015 and 2017 the strategy was \nintroduced in 4 additional provinces. \nMain challenges when scaling-up HPV-Self collection \nwere analyzed through a fidelity study carried out in \nLa Matanza (Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area). Results \nshowed that there were adaptations regarding the offer \nof self-collection, which were the result of the different \nsocial context where women live, and their relationship with health promoters. As a result, the contact was short -\ner, with fewer pieces of information provided to women \nduring the offer. This did not impact the quality of the \nsample taken by women who did accept self-collection, \nbut it might have an impact on the overall acceptability. \nWe also observed that adherence to follow-up was chal -\nlenging, with reduced level of triage when compared to \nlevels obtained in the EMA randomized controlled trial.  \nThe ATICA study was designed to evaluate effective -\nness of an mHealth-based intervention (text messages \nused to communicate with positive women and CHWs) \nto increase adherence to triage by HPV+ women who \nperformed self-collection. The study was an effective -\nness-implementation hybrid type I trial and used a \nmixed-methods approach. Results showed that most \nwomen accepted receiving text messages; the interven -\ntion was effective at increasing triage adherence among \nHPV+ women. \nSummarizing, the studies showed that when offered by \nCHWs, HPV-self collection is acceptable to women and \nhealth providers, and effective to increase screening up -\ntake. However, when scaled-up further adjustments of \nthe offer will be probably needed. Adherence to Triage \nby HPV+ can be challenging. mHealth methods are ef -\nfective to communicate with women with reduced access \nto the health system, they increase triage, and they are \naccepted by women. \nSIMPOSIO SAIC N\u00b03: MATERNAL-FETAL INTERACTION: FROM FERTILIZATION TO THE NEXT GENERATION\nChairs: Dra.

S. Fjeldstad1,2 and Professor Anne Cathrine Staff1,2.\n1Division of Obstetrics and Gyneacology Oslo University Hospital, Norway  \n2Institute for Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway  \nThe talk will start (Staff AC) with a presentation of how \nmultiple adverse obstetric outcomes linked to placental \ndysfunction, including preeclampsia and fetal growth \nrestriction, correlate with an increased risk of several \nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs) in women, particu -\nlarly cardiovascular disease (CVD). The potential mech -\nanisms behind such epidemiological associations will \nbe discussed, as well as the need for improving how we \ntarget the women who are at the greatest risk of CVD \nfor intensified follow-up and primary prevention of pre -\nmature morbidity and mortality. The lack of applicability \nin traditional clinical scoring systems for assessing young \nwomen after pregnancy with respect to prediction of fu -\nture CVD will be presented, as well as some promising \nbiomarkers for precision follow-up. An improved patho -\nphysiological understanding of the crosstalk between the \nplacenta and the cardiovascular system will likely lead \nto new opportunities for intervention and prevention of \nNCDs in women.\nThe talk will continue (Fjeldstad HES) with the presenta -\ntion of our hypothesis that placental dysfunction, second -ary to poor maternal-fetal tolerance, leads to increased \nlevels of cellular fetal microchimerism (cFMC). cFMC \narises during pregnancy when fetal cells with stem cell \nlike properties cross the placenta and are incorporated \ninto the pregnant woman\u2019s body longterm. The back -\nground for our hypothesis is that circulating cFMC is \nknown to be augmented in preeclampsia, a hyperten -\nsive pregnancy complication characterized by placental \ndysfunction. Furthermore, we will present findings from \npapers suggesting a link between cFMC and maternal \nautoimmunity, cancer, wound healing, and potentially \ncardiovascular disease. As cFMC is known to persist for \ndecades following pregnancy, and is augmented in pre -\neclampsia, which we in turn know is linked to longterm \nCVD, we hypothesize that there may be a role for these \ncells in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and neuro -\nvascular disease involving small and larger arteries, pos -\nsibly by way of inflammatory pathways. Some preliminary \ncFMC data from our own follow-up studies of women with \na history of placental dysfunction will be presented.\nFETAL PROGRAMMING OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES IN MATERNAL DIABETES: \nINSIGHTS IN THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED\nRomina Higa, Mar\u00eda Laura Leonardi, Evangelina Capobianco, Alicia Jawerbaum\nBuenos Aires University, Faculty of Medicine-CONICET. Laboratory of Reproduction and Metabolism, \nCEFYBO, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nCardiovascular diseases are increasing at alarming \nrates in both developed and developing countries. Al -\nthough lifestyle choices and genetic predisposition are \nmain contributors to cardiometabolic diseases, growing \nevidence indicates that in utero  exposure to adverse en -\nvironmental conditions leads the developing offspring to \nhave numerous risk factors, which may have an impact \nlater in life.\nMaternal diabetes is a prevalent pathology that increases \nthe risk of cardiovascular diseases in the offspring. The \nheart is one of the main target organs affected by this \nmetabolic disease from the embryonic stage and until \nthe adult life. Putative mechanism involved in intrauterine programming of heart damage evidenced in experimen -\ntal models of maternal diabetes will be presented. The \nfocus will be on altered pathways that regulates cardiac \ncellular metabolism, the damaging effects of the proo -\nxidant and proinflammatory environment and alterations \non the cardiac extracellular matrix remodeling. The role of \nthree main players of these pathways will be discussed: \nmechanistic target of rapamycin, a cellular sensor for \nenergy metabolism and nutrient availability that controls \ncellular growth and metabolism, peroxisome proliferator \nactivated receptors, nuclear receptors highly involved in \nheart metabolic processes and lipid metabolism and the \ntranscription factor forkhead box protein O1 which partic -SYMPOSIA41\nipates in myocardial metabolic stress adaptation, oxida -\ntive stress, endothelial dysfunction and other processes \nrelated to inflammation and apoptosis.\nAll these pathways are interconnected evidencing the complexity of this process but also bringing opportunities \nto facilitate intervention to provide protective effects to \nprevent the programming of cardiovascular diseases in \nthe offspring of diabetic pregnancies.\nSIMPOSIO SAIC N\u00b04: NEW TREATMENTS IN SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY (SMA): FROM BASIC \nRESEARCH TO PATIENTS TREATMENT\nChairs: Dr. Pablo Gravina y Dra.

Humans have a paralog gene, SMN2, \nthat cannot fully compensate for the deficiency in the \nSMN protein because its exon 7 (E7) is poorly included \nin the mature mRNA.\nA successful approved therapy for SMA restores normal \nlevels of SMN expression using an antisense oligonu -\ncleotide (ASO1, nusinersen or Spinraza) designed to in -\ncrease E7 inclusion in the SMN2 transcript. Our studies \naim at understanding the detailed mechanisms by which \nhistone marks that affect chromatin structure, modulate \nthe effects of nusinersen on SMN2 E7 inclusion, mainly \nthrough the control of RNA polymerase II transcriptional \nelongation.\nPreviously we showed that slow transcriptional elon -\ngation promotes SMN2  E7 skipping. Consistently, in -\ntragenic chromatin decondensation elicited by histone \ndeacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors such as valproic acid \n(VPA) promotes SMN2  E7 inclusion. VPA cooperates with a nusinersen-like ASO1 to promote E7 inclusion. \nASO1 also elicits the deployment of the silencing histone \nmark H3K9me2 on the SMN2  gene, creating a roadblock \nto RNA polymerase II elongation that acts negatively on \nE7 inclusion. By removing the roadblock, VPA counter -\nacts the undesired chromatin effects of ASO1, resulting \nin higher E7 inclusion. Combined systemic administra -\ntion of ASO1 and VPA in neonate SMA mice had strong \nsynergistic effects on SMN expression, growth, survival, \nand neuromuscular function.\nWe analyzed the effects of ASO1 and/or VPA on the de -\nployment of the H3K9me2 mark genome-wide by ChIP-\nseq, obtaining results that support the evidence that the \nASO1\u2019s chromatin effect on the SMN genes is highly \nspecific.\nBased on these observations, we suggest that HDAC in -\nhibitors have the potential to increase the clinical efficacy \nof nusinersen, and perhaps other splicing-modulatory \nASO drugs.\nEARLY INTERVENTION AND THERAPEUTIC EXPERIENCE IN SMA: LESSONS LEARNED \nAND FUTURE DIRECTIONS \nEduardo F. Tizzano \nDepartment of Clinical and Molecular Genetics and Medicine Genetics Group, Valle Hebron University Hospital and Valle Hebron \nResearch Institute, Barcelona, Spain  \nSpinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal reces -\nsive motor neuron disorder characterized by progres -\nsive muscle weakness and atrophy as a result of motor \nneuron degeneration and loss in the anterior horn of the \nspinal cord. With an incidence of 1 in 10,000 live births \nand a carrier frequency around 1/50 is one of the com -\nmonest severe hereditary disorders of infancy and early \nchildhood. Despite SMA clinically manifests as a contin -\nuum, based on age of onset, achieved motor milestones \nand clinical severity, SMA patients are divided into type \n0-IV ranging from very severe congenital forms with short \nlife expectancy due to respiratory failure to adult-onset \npatients maintaining the ability to walk. SMA is a disease \nof two genes, a determinant SMN1  and a modifier SMN2 . \nPathogenic variants in the SMN1  gene cause SMA dis -\nease whereas SMN2 copy number is variable from 1 to 5 in most SMA patients. Numerous studies show that the \nhigher the number of copies of SMN2  the greater the \namount of complete SMN protein produced, the milder \nthe associated SMA phenotype and vice versa. \nKnowledge and advances on SMA genetics allowed the \ndevelopment and approval of tailored therapies that has \nchanged trajectories of the disease with evolving pheno -\ntypes. Nusinersen and risdiplam agents are designed to \nbind specifically to SMN2 pre-mRNA in order to promote \nexon 7 inclusion increasing the amount of functional \nSMN protein. Onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi, a third \napproved treatment, consists of a gene replacement \ntherapy that restores the expression of normal SMN1  \nusing a viral vector (AAV9) expressing SMN1 . While the \nSMN2  endogenous target regions comprise splicing reg -\nulators and intronic regions, the SMN1 transgene in the MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 202142\nAAV9 is an SMN1  cDNA lacking intronic or other regula -\ntory elements. \nSeveral clinical investigations demonstrate that early \ndiagnosis and intervention is essential for improved re -\nsponse to these treatments and better prognosis. Ther -\napeutic interventions that are effective at pre-symptom -\natic or early stages of the disease creates the need for \nawareness, expedite diagnosis and consideration of newborn screening programs as well as the implemen -\ntation of an adequate process of communication, genetic \ncounseling and management of expectations for the pa -\ntient and family.  \nSupported by Biogen, Roche, Galicia AME and the Span -\nish Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Fondo de Investigaciones \nSanitarias and cofunded with ERDF funds (Grant No. FIS \nPI18/000687) for SMA research grants.  \nMANAGEMENT OF SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY IN ARGENTINA: CARE EVOLUTION \nAND CURRENT SITUATION\nSoledad Monges\nDepartment of Neurology, Hospital de Pediatr\u00eda \u201cProf. Dr. Juan P. Garrahan\u201d, Buenos Aires, Argentina\nSpinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal reces -\nsive neuromuscular disorder, considered one of the lead -\ning causes of infant mortality. It is caused by mutations \nin the SMN1  gene. Over the past two decades, knowl -\nedge on the disease has greatly increased leading to the \ndevelopment of new treatments and the approval of the \nfirst drug Spinraza by the F.D.A. (Food and Drug Admin -\nistration, USA) at the end of 2016. General management \nand care of SMA patients varies due to heterogeneous \nhealth care in Latam as in Argentina. In 1997, the first \nmolecular studies of the SMN1 gene were performed in \nour country. In 2006, a program was set up for patient \ncare, teaching, and research in NMD at Hospital Garrah -\nan in order to improve the quality of life of SMA patients. \nA dedicated and trained interdisciplinary team was set \nup, consisting of a neurologist, physical therapist, pathol -\nogist, clinician, geneticist, palliative care specialist, nu -\ntritionist, and endocrinologist, among others. The team covers different aspects of the SMA patient ranging from \ndiagnosis to transition to adult care and end-of-life pal -\nliative care for the patients and their families. In 2004, \nfamilies of patients with SMA have set up a non-profit as -\nsociation in Argentina (FAME; www.fameargentina.com.\nar/). This parent association has been a strong advocate \nfor and sponsor of the development of early diagnosis, \ncare, and research, allowing for health professionals \nin the field to attend international meetings and online \ncourses and participating in the organization of training \nsymposia. Different regional academic-scientific organi -\nzations and SMA parent organizations are contributing \nto the increased quality of the management of SMA pa -\ntients. In spite of these efforts in Argentina, the treatment \ngap - the difference between people with SMA and the \npatients who are actually treated - is still wide. There is \na need to create new awareness of the disease so as to \nget to an early diagnosis and treatment.\nSIMPOSIO SAI N\u00b0 4: TISSUE SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSE II\nChairs: Dra. Carolina Amezcua y Dra. Maria Silvia Ventimiglia\nREGULATION OF ENTERIC IMMUNITY: A CYTOKINE\u2019S CELLULAR STRATIFICATION OF FUNCTION \nRuaidhr\u00ed Jackson \nDepartment of Immunology, Harvard Medical School\nThe intestinal mucosal barrier is critical in maintaining a \nbalance of tolerance to the commensal microflora while \nreserving the capacity to combat invasive microbial in -\nfection. Although it is not surprising that immune and in -\ntestinal epithelial cells have been discovered to play a \nmajor role in orchestrating this equilibrium, they alone do \nnot solely control intestinal homeostasis, and there is an \nemerging appreciation of the vital interconnectivity of the \ndiverse cell types present in the intestine to synchronize \nmucosal immunity. Here we have uncovered that the \ncellular source of IL-18 is essential in dictating divergent \nfunctional immune responses in the intestine with major \nimplications for homeostasis and bacterial infection. By \ncombining in situ immuno-fluorescence, smFISH and sin -\ngle cell sequencing, and single cell sequencing analysis, we have identified enteric neurons as a key source of IL-\n18 expression. Interestingly, by conditional deletion of IL-\n18 in the enteric nervous system, we have uncovered it\u2019s \nessential and non-redundant role governing landscape of \nantimicrobial protein expression in the colon. By abrogat -\ning neuron-derived IL-18, we observed a breakdown in \nthe sterility of the inner mucus layer and an inappropriate \ninfiltration of the resident microbiota. Strikingly, mice de -\nficient in neuronal-derived IL-18 were highly susceptible \nto invasive Salmonella typhimurium infection. Together, \nthis work identifies enteric neurons as another arm of the \ninnate immune response and highlights a new area of \ninvestigation in the mechanism controlling mucosal im -\nmunity.

I outline the heterogeneity of T helper cells in hu -\nman nasal polyp tissue, a Th2 cell-driven disorder of the \nnasal cavity that is highly associated with asthma. Lastly, \nI reflect on the clonal heterogeneity of T helper cells and \nwhat this may tell us about T helper cell differentiation \nfrom na\u00efve CD4 T cells.  \nA NOVEL MECHANISM FOR PRETERM LABOR AND BIRTH:  CONFLICT BETWEEN REGULATORY \nAND EFFECTOR T CELLS\nNardhy Gomez-Lopez1-3\n1Perinatology Research Branch, Division of Obstetrics and Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Division of Intramural Research, Eunice Ken -\nnedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services (NICHD/NIH/DHHS); Bethesda, Maryland, 20892 and Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA\n2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA\n3Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA\nPreterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity \nand mortality worldwide, which, in most cases, is preced -\ned by spontaneous preterm labor, a syndrome of multiple \netiologies. Intra-amniotic infection is a recognized cause \nof spontaneous preterm labor; however, the remaining \netiologies are poorly understood. We hypothesize that \na tight balance between regulatory (Tregs) and effector \n(Teffs) T cells is required for successful pregnancy, and \nthat a conflict between these adaptive immune cells can \nlead to preterm labor and birth. First, we report that the \ntargeted depletion of functional Tregs during the first and \nsecond pregnancy induces preterm labor/birth and ad -\nverse neonatal outcomes. The depletion of Tregs also \nincreases maternal susceptibility to infection leading to \npreterm birth. Furthermore, the depletion of Tregs caus -\nes mild cellular immune responses in the placenta and \nsystemic maternal inflammation, in the absence of a fetal \ninflammatory response. Next, we show that functional \nTregs are reduced at the human maternal-fetal interface \nin non-inflammatory preterm labor (i.e. idiopathic preterm \nlabor). Such a Treg reduction is accompanied by a con -\ncomitant increase in Teffs, which display an activated \nphenotype and are enriched at the maternal-fetal inter -\nface of women with spontaneous preterm labor and birth. Following, we show that the non-specific in vivo system -\nic activation of T cells induces preterm birth by eliciting \nan inflammatory response notably distinct from that of \nendotoxin- or RU486-induced preterm birth. Moreover, \nplacental single-cell RNA sequencing-derived signatures \nof activated T cells can be monitored in the maternal cir -\nculation, and such are enhanced in women who under -\nwent spontaneous preterm labor and birth. Collectively, \nthese findings implicate effector and regulatory T cells in \nthe pathological processes underlying preterm labor and \nbirth and accentuate the importance of these adaptive \nimmune cells during pregnancy. \nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported, in part, by the Perinatol -\nogy Research Branch, Division of Obstetrics and Ma -\nternal-Fetal Medicine, Division of Intramural Research, \nEunice Kennedy Shriver  National Institute of Child Health \nand Human Development, National Institutes of Health, \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (NICHD/\nNIH/DHHS); and, in part, with Federal funds from NICHD/\nNIH/DHHS under Contract No. HHSN275201300006C. \nThis research was also supported by the Wayne State \nUniversity Perinatal Initiative in Maternal, Perinatal and \nChild Health.\nSIMPOSIO AAFE N\u00b03: MICROBIOME: ITS POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND CLINICAL EVIDENCE\nChair: Dra.

Cirrhosis is a consequence \nof chronic liver inflammation that is followed by diffuse hepatic fibrosis, which eventually leads to liver failure. \nThe microbiota, including bacteria (bacteriome), but also \nfungi (fungome) and viruses (virome), are also known to MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 202144\nchange during the development and progression of cir -\nrhosis. Several factors appear to affect the microbiota \nincluding the aetiology of liver disease, such as alcohol \nand diet (in the case of metabolic associated fatty liver \ndisease [MAFLD]). This last etiology is particularly inter -\nesting since changes in microbiota might be closely relat -\ned to the patog\u00e9nesis of MAFLD which currently affects \napproximately 25 % of adult population in the world.\nChronic liver disease (CLD) may cause cholestasis, \nwhich impairs the enterohepatic circulation and affects \nthe microbiota. As CLD progresses, changes in microbi -\nota (dysbiosis) are maintained and further exacerbated, \nprobably by changes in intestinal motility, permeability, \nbarrier function towards the lymphatic and blood com -\npartment, portal hypertension and the immune system. \nYet the role of the microbiota seems to be pivotal in pa -\ntients with decompensated cirrhosis, as many decom -\npensating events are related to microbes or their inter -action with the host.\nChanges in the microbiota occur early in the develop -\nment of CLD, even before detectable liver damage, es -\npecially in alcohol-related CLD and MAFLD. Different \nstudies have shown shifts in the composition of the gut \nmicrobiome in different CLDs. Yet, one common prop -\nerty of these changes, which is easy to assess, is the \nmassive reduction in microbial diversity upon the de -\nvelopment of cirrhosis and the even greater reduction \nupon decompensation. In addition to reduced species \ndiversity, bacterial overgrowth occurs in the small bow -\nel, so-called small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). \nThe motility of the gut is decreased, which leads to an \nincrease in contact time of bacteria and thereby to fer -\nmentation changes in the luminal content. This may lead \nto changes in the microbial metabolites, which may affect \nthe epithelial cells and the liver itself.\nMICROBIOME: GENERALITIES AND CHARACTERIZATION\nPi\u00f1ero, Tamara Alejandra\nInstituto de Medicina Traslacional e Ingenier\u00eda Biom\u00e9dica-Instituto Universitario Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires-Hospital Italiano \nde Buenos Aires-CONICET\nThe human microbiome can be defined as a microbial \ncommunity, including bacteria, archaea, fungi and virus -\nes, and its interplay with environmental factors.

CRC cases were \nrelated to poor diets with intake of food low in whole \ngrains, low in dairy products and high in red and pro -\ncessed meats. Intestinal microbiota may largely explain \nthe interaction between dietary factors and CRC. It is well known the colorectal carcinogenesis involves ge -\nnetic and environmental factors. Recent studies suggest \nthat several mechanisms implied in carcinogenesis (i.e., \ninflammation, genotoxins, oxidative stress, metabolites), \nare closely linked to the intestinal microbiota. \nThe human intestinal microbiota is composed of 1013 to \n1014 microbes, which represent 10 times more bacterial \ncells than human cells containing > 100 times as many SYMPOSIA45\ngenes as in the human genome. A healthy microbiota \nplays is crucial for developing the intestinal epithelium \nand maintaining immunity. Microbiota dysbiosis alters \nhost physiological functions, leading to various diseases. \nRecent studies analyzed the role of the intestinal micro -\nbiota in colorectal carcinogenesis showing differences in \nthe intestinal microbiota compositions between patients \nwith CRC and healthy individuals. Although the causal -\nity is yet to be in deep characterized, there are several \npotential mechanisms implicated. Moreover, microbiome alterations also occur with colorectal adenoma, the pre -\ncursor of CRC. Additional research suggests that modu -\nlating the intestinal microbiome may be a new strategy \nfor CRC prevention and treatment. This presentation will \nsummarize recent advances in understanding the associ -\nations between the intestinal microbiota and CRC based \non evidence from animal and human studies and it will \nalso describe the clinical value of the intestinal microbio -\nta and novel strategies for preventing and treating CRC.\nPROBIOTICS, POSTBIOTICS\u2026 CONCEPTS AND MISTAKES\nLorenzo Morelli\nHead of DISTAS \u2013 Department for Sustainable Food Process \nFaculty of Agriculture, food, and environmental sciences\nUniversit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore -Piacenza and Cremona - Italy\nlorenzo.morelli@unicatt.it\nThis year we are celebrating the first 20 years of life of \nthe 2001/2002 of the FAO/WHO Guidelines for probiot -\nics.

Virginia Massheimer\nTHYROID HORMONES AND IMMUNITY: PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS\nClaudia G. Pellizas\nCentro de Investigaciones en Bioqu\u00edmica Cl\u00ednica y Endocrinolog\u00eda, CIBICI-CONICET; Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica Cl\u00ednica, \nFacultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas, Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina\nGrowing evidence has revealed a bidirectional crosstalk \nbetween thyroid hormones (THs) and the immune sys -\ntem. This interplay has been demonstrated for several \npathophysiological conditions of the thyroid functioning, \nand the innate and adaptive immunity. Many situations \nprimarily affecting the action of THs have an impact on \nthe characteristics and/or functions of immune cells, and \nare translated to host defense status and related disor -\nders. In turn, immune-related disorders conduct  to the \nmost frequent thyroid dysfunctions, which have an auto -\nimmune origin. The connection between these systems \nis complex and not well-understood (Montesinos & Pel -\nlizas, Front  Endocrinol 2019, 10:350). Cellular activity \nof THs is classified as genomic and nongenomic. The \nformer is exerted by the participation of 3,5,3`-triiodothy -\nronine (T3) and its nuclear receptors (TRs). The latter is \ninitiated either by TR isoforms in the cytoplasm and mi -\ntochondria or at the plasma membrane, where the inte -\ngrin aV\u03b23  binds mainly 3, 5, 3` 5` tetraiodothyronine (T4, \nBernal et al. Nat Rev Endocrinol 2015, 11 690). It has \nbecome clear that immune cells should be considered as \nTH target cells. Neutrophils, macrophages, B- and T-lym -\nphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells are affected by thyroid hormone status. Overall, hyperthyroidism tends \nto activate the immune system while a hypothyroid state \nresults in impaired activation of the immune system. Be -\nsides, we provided initial evidence of TR expression in \nmurine dendritic cells (DCs), the main antigen-present -\ning cells, endowed with a unique capacity to recognize, \nprocess and present antigens to naive T cells tailoring \nadaptive immunity. T3-dependent stimulation of DCs po -\ntentiates their ability to develop a Th1 and Th17-type re -\nsponse. Moreover, an increased DC capacity to promote \nantigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell activity, exploited in a \nDC-based antitumor vaccination protocol, was revealed \n(Montesinos & Pellizas, 2019). Given that DCs are main \nplayers in the etiopathogenesis of autoimmune disor -\nders, further research would enlighten the involvement \nof thyroid status at this level. On the other hand, aV\u03b23 \nintegrin is overexpressed and activated in several cancer \nand blood vessel cells, facilitating the hormone prolifer -\native action and worsening cancer processes (Mousa et \nal.,Front. Endocrinol 2021, 12:691736). The presentation \naims to disclose the current evidence supporting the con -\ntribution of THs to the modulation of innate and adaptive \nimmunity.\nADIPOGENESIS AND GLUCOCORTICOID EXCESS\nMar\u00eda Guillermina Zubir\u00eda1, Alejandra Giordano1, Eduardo Spinedi2, Andr\u00e9s Giovambattista1.\n1-Laboratorio de Neuroendocrinolog\u00eda, Instituto Multidisciplinario de Biolog\u00eda Celular (IMBICE, CICPBA-CONICET-UNLP), Calle \nArgentina.\n2-Centro de Endocrinolog\u00eda Experimental y Aplicada (CENEXA, UNLP-CONICET), Facultad de Cs. M\u00e9dicas, \nUniversidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina.\nIt is known that Glucocorticoids (GCs) have several ef -\nfects on the organism, including glucose homeostasis, \nmodulation of the inflammatory response and the reg -\nulation of functions of adipose tissue (AT). In chronic \nstate of high endogenous levels of GCs, e.g. Cushing \nSyndrome (CS), abdominal AT mass and adipocyte size \nare enhanced and the pattern of adipokine secretion is \naltered, evidencing that GCs play a pivotal role in the \ndevelopment of metabolic disturbances associated with \nabdominal AT dysfunction. Adipogenesis can be divided \ninto two sequential steps: commitment of mesenchymal \nstem cells to adipocyte precursor cells (APCs) and termi -\nnal adipocyte differentiation. APCs express the cell sur -\nface marker CD34, which characterized adipogenic cells \nin the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of the AT. CD34+ \ncells also express the transcriptional factor Zfp423, that \nin turn activates expression of PPAR\u03b32 which assures \nAPCs conversion into adipocytes. Adipocyte terminal dif -ferentiation depends on APCs adipogenic competency, \nthat is the ability of APCs to differentiate into adipocytes \nin response to a defined stimulus. Thus, the competency \nof APCs could be modulated by the expression of Zfp423 \nand PPAR\u03b32, which could be postulated as adipogenic \ncompetency markers. GCs has been widely used as ad -\nipogenic inducer of terminal differentiation, mainly by the \nearly induction of two transcription factors, C/EBP\u03b4 and \nC/EBP\u03b2. Afterwards, C/EBP\u03b4 and C/EBP\u03b2 activate C/\nEBP\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b32 expressions, two key pro-adipogenic \nfactors necessary for adipocyte differentiation. Several \nstudies demonstrated that GCs exert their pro-adipo -\ngenic effects by binding to mineralocorticoid (MR) and/or \nglucocorticoid (GR) receptors. Nevertheless, the relative \ncontribution of MR or GR in the biological actions of GCs \nin AT is still a matter of debate. Nowadays, adipogene -\nsis is considered as a general process that includes the \ngeneration of both white and beige adipocytes, each one SYMPOSIA47\nfrom an specific APC residing in AT. Beige adipocytes are \ncharacterized by high mitochondrial content and UCP-1 \nexpression, which confers the ability to dissipate energy \nby heat production (thermogenesis). The appearance of \nbeige adipocytes in White AT is promoted by cold expo -sure or B3AR stimulation. Here, we will focus on under -\nstanding the role of GCs in two processes from AT: the \ncompetency of APCs and the involvement of GR and MR \nin it, and the modulation of White AT browning.\nPHYTOESTROGENS: BONE-VASCULAR ACTIONS\nVirginia Massheimer\nBiology and Biomedicine Research Institute (INBIOSUR-CONICET); Biology, Biochemical & Pharmacy Department, \nSouth National University (BByF-UNS). Bah\u00eda Blanca, Argentine\nPhytoestrogens (PE) like soy isoflavones, are proposed \nas a natural therapy to counteract the risk of cardiovas -\ncular and bone pathologies. The prevalence of these dis -\neases is higher in postmenopausal women, fact mainly \nattributed to the decline of ovarian estradiol production. \nAtherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory process that, \nin the later step of plaque generation could conduct to \nvascular calcification (VCa). On the other hand, osteopo -\nrosis represents a skeletal disorder characterized by an \nimbalance between bone formation and resorption.\nIn our lab, we investigated the cellular and molecular ac -\ntion of the isoflavone Genistein (Gen) on the events in -\nvolved in VCa; in bone formation; and on the interactions \nbetween bone and vascular cells.\nOur data support the hypothesis that Gen prevents in \nvitro VCa. The PE promotes endothelial nitric oxide syn -\nthesis, and favors cell growth and survival under oxida -\ntive stress. Gen down-regulated the expression of both, \nendothelial cell adhesion molecules (VCAM-1; ICAM-1) \nand monocytes integrins involved in leukocyte attach -\nment to vascular endothelium induced by a pro-inflam -\nmatory environment. On vascular muscle cells, the PE \ninhibited cell transdifferentiation into osteoblasts like \ncells, a key event that triggers VCa. Alkaline phospha -tase (ALP) and calcified nodules deposition in the extra -\ncellular matrix, markers of transdifferentiation, were sig -\nnificantly reduced after Gen treatment. The reduction of \ncalcified areas evidenced in ex vivo assays using aortic \ntissue, confirmed these results.\nIn contrast to this anti-osteogenic action observed on \nvascular tissue, on bone cells Gen promoted osteoblas -\ntogenesis by an earlier up-regulation of the ER\u03b1 and \nRunx2 gene expression of calvaria pre-osteoblast. The \ndifferentiative effect was accompanied by enhancements \nin ALP activity, in extracellular collagen deposition, and \nin matrix mineralization. The molecular mechanisms in -\nvolved the participation of ER; NOS; ERK and PI3K path -\nways.\nA bidirectional cross link between bone and vascular \ncells that modulates cells growth and prompts angiogen -\nesis was also evidenced.\nOverall, although the isoflavone exerts opposite effects \non bone and vascular cells, the action displayed could \nbe favorable for the maintenance each tissue homeosta -\nsis. These effects may be relevant in hypoestrogenism \nstage, where bone loss and vascular diseases could be \nameliorated by the administration of estrogens from the \nplant kingdom.\nSIMPOSIO AAFE N\u00b04: IMPACT OF PATENTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL \nSTRATEGIES\nChairs: Dra. Myriam Laconi y Dr. Santiago Palma\nFREE PATENTS, VACCINES FOR EVERYONE? THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS \nFOR AN ETHICAL DILEMMA\nMario Cisneros\nUniversidad Nacional de Mar del Plata, Argentina.\nOn May 5, 2021, the US administration surprised the \nworld by openly supporting the release of patents in hands \nof pharmaceutical companies protecting COVID-19 vac -\ncines, an initiative that, if implemented, would allow other \ncompanies to replicate the technologies involved any -\nwhere without previous authorization by its developers. \nThe decision, according to the US government, aims \nto \u201cget as many safe and effective vaccines to as many \npeople as fast as possible\u201d.\nActivist and the WHO celebrated the decision, believing \nthat it aims to solve existing limitations in terms of drugs \navailability in different parts of the world. Nevertheless, pharmaceutical companies pointed out that following this \npolicy will bring them not only economic losses, but also \nwill damage to the global pharmaceutical innovation sys -\ntem.\nAlthough there is a general perception about the bene -\nfits generated by the existence of a legal system for the \nprotection of inventions, the reality is that such a system \nentails social costs that must be taken into account and \ncan only be justified if the general long-term generated \nbenefits exceed the costs. The accepted economic theo -\nry stipulates that the patent system comes to solve mar -\nket failures generated by their nature as \u201cnon-rivals\u201d and MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 202148\n\u201cnon-exclusive\u201d assets, according to which innovations \nwould not be generated if the economic benefits generat -\ned bu them can not be appropriated by their creators. In \nturn, the economic monopoly granted by patents predicts \na cost to society created by the inefficiency of the market, \nin this case, by the lack of competition for a given prod -\nuct. There are a variety of counterarguments against this \ntheory.This work aims to introduce the theoretical foundations \nto address the existing tension between two conflicting \npositions: on the one hand, the need to have economic \nincentives that motivate vaccine developers investments \nin order to have safe, effective, rapidly available vaccines \nand, on the one hand, the right of people and society to \naccess essential medicines.\nPATENTS: PRINCIPLE OF TERRITORIALITY, CLAIMS AS THE SCOPE OF INVENTIONS, FREEDOM TO \nOPERATE, COMPULSORY LICENSES. \nSilvia Eliana Sarris\nUniversidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina.\nCompulsory licenses are a temporary limitation National \nStates can apply to holders\u2019 exclusive rights over patent -\ned inventions. That implies the possibility of third parties \nto exploit those patents without holders\u2019 consent.\nIn the pandemic global context caused by Covid-19, \nseveral governments have tried to implement compulso -\nry licenses as a tool for national production of vaccines \nagainst the virus.\nHowever, it is necessary to analyse whether such at -\ntempts constitute an effective solution to achieve the in -\ntended purpose, or whether it is required to identify other \nkind of measures to be carried out.\nIntellectual property tends to create incentive for inven -\ntors, creators and holders who invest in R&D and/or in \nacquiring cutting-edge technologies for innovation. In this \nsense, and specifically regarding patents, national and \ninternational regulations grant exclusive rights to patent \napplicants, requiring in turn a sufficient disclosure of the \ninformation related to the invention. Furthermore, exclu -\nsive rights are granted for a term of up to 20 years, if \ngranted.\nTherefore, after the expiration of this period, or in the event that a patent expires for administrative reasons or \nwhether the owner waives his rights, or if the patent ap -\nplication is never granted, the information becomes part \nof the domain public and free to operate then within all \ncountries where the patent has not been applied for and \ngranted.\nAdditionally, not all the information required for produc -\ntion is part of one or more patents (either because it is not \nnovel, or it lacks of inventive step, that is, it is obvious for \na person skilled in the matter).\nLikewise, there may be information that has not been \never disclosed (confidential information, industrial se -\ncrets about production techniques, trade secrets of raw \nmaterial suppliers, supplies, know-how of highly qualified \nlabour, etc). Consequently, compulsory licenses would \nnot ensure a successful transfer of technology and as -\nsociated knowledge, necessary for building the required \nfacilities, training human resources for production, and \nacquisition of necessary materials. \nContrarily, successful technology transfer has been \nachieved with licensing contracts, such as Sputnik \u2013 \nRichmond, and Oxford - AstraZeneca cases.\nPATENT YES OR PATENT NO?: THE SOCIAL CHALLENGE OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS \nTO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC.\nLeandro V\u00edctor Sorbello \nUniversidad Nacional de Cuyo.

Flanagan \nSchool of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Tasmania, Australia\nSchool of Health and Biomedical Science, RMIT University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\nDepartment of Immunology and Pathology, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\nSystems vaccinology is an emerging field of vaccine re -\nsearch whereby systems biology techniques are used to \nstudy vaccine responses, providing novel insights into \nvaccine mechanisms and effects. It has long been known \nthat males and females respond differently to vaccination \nbut the mechanisms were not known. Systems vaccinol -\nogy is now being used to elucidate the sex-differential \nbiological pathways induced by vaccination. In addition \nto inducing a response against the vaccine-targeted dis -\nease, vaccines also have non-targeted effects whereby \nthey modulate the immune system and alter suscepti -bility to non-vaccine targeted infections. For example, \nmeasles vaccination and BCG decrease susceptibility \nto respiratory infections and bacterial sepsis. Systems \nvaccinology, particularly transcriptomics and epigenom -\nics, has been used to determine the biological mecha -\nnisms of vaccine-induced non-targeted effects. The very \nyoung and aging individuals have greater susceptibility \nto vaccine preventable diseases and thus are key target \ngroups for vaccination. This talk will therefore focus on \nsystems vaccinology studies conducted at the extremes \nof age.\nEXPLORING IMMUNE CELL STATES IN CANCER AND INFECTION.\nNEW METHODS FOR SINGLE-CELL DATA SCIENCE\nSantiago J.

Single-cell omics analysis of cancer patients\u2019 biop -\nsies is rapidly expanding. However, while the resolution \nat which we can now profile cellular states has increased \ndramatically, biological interpretation of these data re -\nmains a major challenge in the field. In particular, compu -\ntational methods to accurately interpret single-cell data in the context of previous studies and prior knowledge are \ncurrently lacking.\nI will discuss some of the current challenges in single-cell \ndata science, and present novel computational meth -\nods we are developing to interpret immunological states \nacross individuals and tissues, in health and disease. I \nwill focus on the construction of reference transcriptional \natlases to summarize knowledge from multiple studies, \nand how they can be used to interpret T cell immune re -\nsponses.\nWe envision that meta-analyses of single-cell omics data \nfrom patients and mouse models will be fundamental to \nunderstand the cellular mechanisms of cancer therapy \nresistance, to identify biomarkers of response for clinical \ndecision support and to identify novel therapeutic oppor -\ntunities.\nSEXUAL DIMORPHISM OF HUMAN DISEASES: A SYSTEMS IMMUNOLOGY PERSPECTIVE\nHelder I Nakaya\nHospital Israelita Albert Einstein.Av.

The time and high economic \ninvestment required for the discovery and development \nof new molecules have motivated the proposal of strat -\negies to identify \u201cold drugs for new uses\u201d in a variety of \ntherapeutic fields. The surprising outbreak of the SARS-\nCoV-2 virus pandemic prompted a remarkable effort to \nfind treatment alternatives through the repositioning of \nexisting molecules. Antiparasitic, antiviral, antimicrobi -\nal, anti-inflammatory, and antihypertensive drugs have \nbeen evaluated as treatments for COVID-19. Ivermec -\ntin (IVM), a successful antiparasitic drug widely used in \nanimal and human health (2 billion people treated over \n30 years), has been investigated as a model for reposi -\ntioning towards other therapeutic indications. Its antivi -\nral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antitumor \nactivity has been described. IVM (April 2020) emerged \nas a promising molecule due to its in vitro antiviral ef -\nfect on SARS-CoV-2. Since that time, different types of \nstudies have been carried out to evaluate its in vivo ac -\ntivity and measure the clinical benefits of its pre-emptive and / or curative use. The main antiviral mechanism of \nIVM is based on an inhibition of nuclear transport of vi -\nral proteins mediated by importin alpha / beta1. Other \ntargets for a direct antiviral effect and anti-inflammatory \n/ immunomodulatory activity of IVM have recently been \ndescribed. The direct relationship between systemic ex -\nposure and the decrease in viral load in patients treat -\ned with high doses at the onset of symptoms (PK / PD \nratio) was demonstrated in a multicentre clinical study \nconducted in Argentina. Today there is an important body \nof scientific evidence supporting the favourable effect of \nIVM on SARS-CoV-2. However, divergent paths have \nemerged between the (sometimes disorderly) attempt \nof science to provide clarifying evidence on clinical is -\nsues, the position of regulatory bodies, and the interest \nof pharmaceutical corporations. This unresolved dilem -\nma has made it difficult to advance scientifically with the \nrepositioning of a molecule (safe and inexpensive) that \nundoubtedly deserves to be considered.\nNote: For reasons of space, the references that support \nthe technical concepts expressed in this summary are \nnot included, being available at the request of whoever \nis interested.\nVACCINE DEVELOPMENT AND NEW STRATEGIES\nOsvaldo L. Podhajcer\nHead, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy, Leloir Institute-National Council for Scientific \nand Technical Research (CONICET).\nThe disease caused by the novel coronavirus Severe \nAcute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-\nCoV-2) has had an effect of enormous proportions, glob -\nally leading to more than 200 million confirmed cases \nand causing more than 4 million deaths. Most approved \nvaccines against COVID-19 have to be administered in a \nprime/boost regimen. Getting a single dose vaccine with \nsuitable stability and storage properties that can reach \nrapidly the local population, is a major challenge for the \nscientific community especially in low and middle income \ncountries. We engineered a novel vaccine based on a \nchimeric human adenovirus 5 (hAdV5) vector. The vac -\ncine (named CoroVaxG.3) is based on three pillars: i) high \nexpression of Spike to enhance its immunodominance by \nusing a potent promoter and a mRNA stabilizer; ii) en -\nhanced infection of muscle and dendritic cells by replac -ing the fiber knob domain of hAdV5 by hAdV3; iii) use of \nSpike stabilized in a prefusion conformation. Transduc -\ntion with CoroVaxG.3 expressing Spike (D614G) dramat -\nically enhanced Spike expression in human muscle cells, \nmonocytes and dendritic cells compared to CoroVaxG.5 \nthat expressed the native fiber knob domain. A single \ndose of CoroVaxG.3 induced potent humoral immunity \nwith a balanced Th1/Th2 ratio and potent T-cell immunity, \nboth lasting for at least 5 months. Sera from CoroVaxG.3 \nvaccinated mice was able to neutralize pseudoviruses \nexpressing B.1 (wild type D614G), B.1.117 (alpha), P.1 \n(gamma) and B.1.617.2 (delta) Spikes, as well as an au -\nthentic P.1 SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Neutralizing antibodies \ndid not wane even after 5 months making this kind of \nvaccine a likely candidate to enter clinical trialsSYMPOSIA51\nPREVENTION AND TREATMENT FOR COVID 19: WHAT WE LEARNED \nAND THE CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN:\nVentura Simonovich\nHospital Italiano, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nSince the beginning of the COVID 19 pandemic, we \nhave faced very different difficulties than those we ex -\nperienced in previous pandemics. This also brings with \nit scenarios that in normal moments we would not have \nbeen able to imagine.\nEvidence-based medicine took a limited place at the be -\nginning, being the experiences of using a drug the usual \nat the beginning, with no evidence in most cases. The \nneed to do something passed over rationality, thus gen -\nerating very unfortunate situations for the management \nof patients. Drug repositioning was many times trans -\nferred to the bedside without adequate assessment of \nthe risks and pharmacokinetic profiles, despite many \nbeing done outside of properly designed and conducted \nclinical trials.\nThe value of interaction and solidarity between different \nscientific groups allowed in record times develop diag -\nnostic methods, vaccines, treatments. It was also possi -\nble to show that a complex clinical trial is not necessary \nto be able to demonstrate the efficacy or lack of it of a \ncertain treatment, the paradigm of this being the British \nRECOVERY study, which allowed in a pragmatic envi -ronment to define treatments as dexamethasone or to -\ncilizumab that changed the prognosis of the most serious \npatients infected by COVID 19. Other treatments fell by \nthe wayside, such as hydroxychloroquine, convalescent \nplasma and ivermectin.\nThe role of governments in promoting treatments that \nhad no evidence was at least controversial, being some -\nthing that should definitely be avoided for the future.\nThe development of vaccines showed the dissemina -\ntion of two technologies such as mRNA and Adenovirus \nvectors as the spearhead for the mass immunization of \nhundreds of millions of people. However, accessibility \nbarriers and anti-vaccine movements reduced the pos -\nsibility of a faster exit, as well as the appearance of new \nvariants.\nThe pandemic showed the weaknesses of the health \nsystem in all its aspects, as well as the strength of sci -\nence to be able to overcome the most important medical \nevent of the last 100 years, this being the strongest learn -\ning.

POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS WITH CONCOMITANT MEDICATION\nMarta V\u00e1zquez\nPharmaceutical Sciences Department, Faculty of Chemistry, Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica, Montevideo, Uruguay\nAbsorption and disposition of cannabinoids vary as a \nfunction of the route of administration. The bioavailability \nof inhaled cannabinoids is 10% to 35%, whereas after \noral ingestion the bioavailability is only 4% to 12% due \nto first-pass metabolism and thus absorption is highly \nvariable. Cannabinoids are highly lipid soluble and are \ntherefore rapidly taken up by fat tissue being this tissue a \nlong-term storage site. They are highly protein-bound in \nblood and are mainly bound to low-density lipoproteins, \nwith up to 10% present in red blood cells and only 2-3% \nas free drug. They are eliminated from plasma mainly \nby metabolism in the liver in a multiphasic manner. The \nreal elimination half-lives of cannabinoids are difficult to \ncalculate from plasma as the equilibrium plasma/fatty \ntissue is slowly reached. Therefore, variable elimination \nhalf-lives are reported in the literature. With increasing \ncannabis use, the potential for cannabinoids interacting \nwith other therapeutic agents also increases. Therefore, \ntheir use in therapy could interfere with the absorption \nand/or disposition of other drugs that undergo the same metabolic pathways or on the other hand, other medica -\ntions could interfere with cannabinoids pharmacokinet -\nics. Both cannabidiol (CBD) and \u03949-tetrahydrocannab -\ninol (THC) or their metabolites are not only substrates \nbut also inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 enzymes and \nUGTs. Moreover, and according to some in vitro  studies, \nthese two major cannabinoids can inhibit carboxylester -\nases involved in the deactivation/detoxification or meta -\nbolic activation of some medications. In vitro  and animal \nstudies have also shown that CBD and THC interact in \nsome way with ATP-binding cassette superfamily (inhib -\niting or downregulating their expression) and thus, a sig -\nnificant impact on the absorption and disposition of other \nco-administered drugs that are also substrates of these \ntransporters may be expected. Health care profession -\nals must be aware of drug-drug interactions given that \nthe diseases and conditions most frequently targeted for \ntreatment with medical cannabis are chronic in nature \nand treated with conventional medications concurrently.

FROM OXYGEN POISONING TO \nREDOX SIGNALING CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF EARLY CONCEPTS\nChairs: Dr. Pablo Evelson y Dr. Cesar Fraga\nMITOCHONDRIAL METABOLISM IN BRAIN AGING\nEnrique Cadenas\nPharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA\nA mitochondrion-centric approach to brain aging requires \nthe coordination of signaling and transcriptional path -\nways modulated by mitochondrion-released hydrogen \nperoxide. These interconnected mechanisms are criti -\ncal in the maintenance of a functional, efficient, and re -\nsponsive mitochondrial population. The gradual decline \nin energy metabolism during brain aging results in a hy -\npometabolic state, which was examined in a model that \nintegrates mitochondrial function, insulin signaling, and \nJNK signaling. Brain aging proceeds with a decrease \nof glucose uptake (dynamic microPET imaging), which \nwas associated with a decrease in the expression of the \ninsulin-sensitive neuronal GLUT4 and microvascular en -\ndothelium GLUT1 (55 kD) but not astrocytic GLUT1 (45 \nkD). Brain aging was associated with an imbalance be -\ntween the PI3K/Akt pathway of insulin signaling and JNK \nsignaling and a down-regulation of the PGC1 a-mediat -\ned transcriptional pathway of mitochondrial biogenesis, thus impairing on several aspects of energy homeosta -\nsis. Of note, these effects were observed in cortex- and \nhippocampal preparations but they are not necessarily \ncell specific, for astrocytes respond in a different man -\nner: astrocytes showed an age-dependent increase in \nmitochondrial oxidative metabolism (respiring either on \nglucose or glucose plus pyruvate) and mitochondrial bio -\ngenesis. These metabolic changes were associated with \nan age-dependent increase in H2O2 generation (largely \nascribed to NOX2) and NF kB signaling as well as aug -\nmented responses with age to inflammatory cytokines. \nFurther, the inflammatory cytokines, IL-1 \u03b2 and TNF a \nstimulated mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and mi -\ntochondrial biogenesis in astrocytes. The significance of \nthis hypometabolic state \u2013associated with mitochondri -\nal dysfunction\u2013 is strengthened by impaired of cognitive \nfunctions as determined by electrophysiology.\nFLAVONOIDS AS REGULATORS OF CELL REDOX HOMEOSTASIS\nPatricia I. Oteiza \nDepartment of Nutrition and Department of Environmental Toxicology, University of California, Davis, USA.\nThe concept that flavonoids could be antioxidants in vivo  \nwas originated based on their chemical structure which \nallows the scavenging of free radicals and the chelation \nof redox active metals. Advancement in the knowledge of \nflavonoid absorption, distribution, metabolism and excre -\ntion (ADME) showed that most flavonoids are minimally \nabsorbed as parent compounds and undergo extensive \nmetabolism by both, the intestinal microbiota and host \ncells. Thus, only at the gastrointestinal tract flavonoids \nwould reach concentrations compatible with a physio -\nlogically relevant antioxidant action. In other organs and tissues, flavonoids are found at very low concentrations \n(nM) and mostly as metabolites that would not support \na direct antioxidant action. On the other hand, a large \nbody of evidence has shown that flavonoid consumption \ndecreases oxidant production and oxidation of cell com -\nponents in humans and experimental models. As an ex -\nample, the flavan-3-ol (-)-epicatechin (EC) and its oligo -\nmers, the procyanindins (PCA), mitigate oxidative stress \nand regulate redox homeostasis in conditions such as \nobesity, inflammation, fatty liver diseases and hyper -\ntension. These actions are not mediated by direct anti -SYMPOSIA53\noxidant mechanisms but through the capacity of these \ncompounds to: i) interact with and regulate the activity of \nproteins involved in oxidant production and antioxidant \nprotection; ii) modulate redox-sensitive transcription fac -\ntors (TF) at different levels, e.g. modulating kinases and \nphosphatases, TF-DNA binding; iii) interact with mem -\nbrane domains, particularly lipid rafts, and iv) regulate oxidant steady state levels. Given the large number of \nflavonoids existing in the human diet it is essential to \nrelate their ADME with their mechanism of action to fi -\nnally be able to develop dietary recommendations aimed \nto the prevention and/or treatment of pathological con -\nditions, especially those characterized by alterations in \nredox homeostasis.\nCHOLESTEROL OXIDATION BETWEEN HEALTH AND DISEASE: FOCUS ON THE ANTIVIRAL \nPROPERTIES OF ENZYMATIC OXYSTEROLS\nGiuseppe Poli1, Andrea Civra1, Alessandro Marcello2, David Lembo1\n1Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Torino, Italy.\n2International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.\nThe epidemiologically proved correlation between cho -\nlesterol and defined chronic diseases, in particular car -\ndiovascular pathology, took hold of the collective imagi -\nnation, so that cholesterol has generally been considered \nas a dangerous molecule. However, this multitasking ste -\nrol is not synonim of disease, being actually involved in a \nnumber of normal cell and tissue functions. In particular \nhere we focus on two physiological cholesterol oxidation \nproducts (oxysterols) of enzymatic origin, namely 25-hy -\ndroxycholesterol (25OHC) and 27-hydroxycholesterol \n(27OHC), that were demonstrated to efficiently counter -\nact not only the replication of enveloped human viruses \nbut also that of non-enveloped ones. In our laboratories, \n25OHC and 27OHC blocked in vitro the infectivity of sev -\neral strains of human rotavirus (HRhV), the agent of se -\nvere children\u2019s gastroenteritis, as well as the replication \nof different strains of human rhinovirus (HRV), the main agent of common cold, being active in the low micromolar \nrange and in the absence of cell toxicity. Of note, the two \noxysterols showed a strong inhibitory effect also when \nadded to cell cultures prior to viral infection. Very recent -\nly, 27OHC, suitably complexed with cyclodextrin (CDX), \nwas proven to strongly inhibit the in vitro replication of \ntwo coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV-2, the agent of \nCOVID-19, and HCoV-OC43, another virus responsible \nfor the common cold, again in the low micromolar range \nand without exerting cytotoxicity. The 27OHC-CDX com -\nplex displayed also preventing effects against the test -\ned viral infections. The present knowledge about the \ncomplex mechanism of antiviral action and the likely in -\nvolvement of the two enzymatic oxysterols 25OHC and \n27OHC in both the innate and the adaptive immune re -\nsponse against viruses will be analyzed and discussed.\nENERGY MANAGEMENT AND MITOCHONDRIAL DYNAMICS DURING ENDOTOXEMIA\nSilvia Alvarez\nUniversidad de Buenos Aires. CONICET. Instituto de Bioqu\u00edmica y Medicina Molecular (IBIMOL). \nCiudad de Buenos Aires. Argentina.\nMitochondria are often considered the \u201cpowerhouse of \nthe cell\u201d owing to their ability to efficiently generate ATP \nrequired to sustain normal cell function. However, the \ndynamic nature of mitochondria and its involvement in a \nplethora of cell signaling cascades has renewed the rec -\nognition of this organelle in cell metabolism and patholog -\nical processes.\nSepsis and endotoxemia are described as a paradigm of \nacute whole body inflammation, characterized by massive \nincreases of NO and inflammatory cytokines in biologi -\ncal fluids, systemic damage in the vascular endothelium, \nand impaired tissue and whole body respiration despite \nadequate O2 supply. Cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction \noccurring during these inflammatory syndromes plays a \nkey role in the development of organ damage mainly by \ndecreased ATP availability. Mitochondrial ATP production, \nO2 consumption and mitochondrial inner membrane po -\ntential are related to blood NO levels and mitochondrial \nprotein nitration, leading to decreased ATP availability \nand impairment of the contractile state. In vivo  modula -tion of NO bioavailability (with c-PTIO or L-NAME) par -\ntially restores cardiac and mitochondrial function, leading \nto propose that NO levels link inflammation with mito -\nchondrial bioenergetics and cardiac contractility state. It \nis important to mention that mitochondrial dynamics may \nadjust cellular mitochondrial architecture to cope with en -\nergy demands. The occurrence of mitochondrial biogene -\nsis, fusion/fission processes, or mitophagy are thought to \nbe activated in the mentioned conditions. Nevertheless, \nit has to be taken into account that partial restoration of \nmitochondrial architecture may not be accompanied by \nimprovement in mitochondrial function. The final scenario \nin these inflammatory syndromes would derive from the \ncomplex relationship between these processes and the \nfinal effect in the cardiac functional response.\nUnraveling the mechanisms involved in the onset of sep -\nsis and endotoxemia would not only improve the interpre -\ntation of the pathology but also would provide new possi -\nbilities for the generation of novel therapeutic targets for \ntreatment in the clinic as well.MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 202154\nSUPEROXIDE, PEROXYNITRITE AND MITOCHONDRIA\nRafael Radi1,2\n1Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica and 2Centro de Investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas (CEINBIO), Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la \nRep\u00fablica, Montevideo, Uruguay\nMitochondria are major intracellular sources of superox -\nide radical (O2\u2022-), the product of the one-electron reduc -\ntion of molecular oxygen. Different mitochondrial sites \nof O2\u2022- formation have been identified, notably compo -\nnents of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Once \nformed, mitochondrial O2\u2022- can either readily dismutate \nby the action of superoxide dismutases, react with mito -\nchondrial targets such as aconitase or yield peroxynitrite \nanion (ONOO-) following the diffusion-controlled reac -\ntion with nitric oxide (\u2022NO). While under most conditions \n\u2022NO reaches mitochondria secondary its diffusion from \nextramitocondrial sites, evidence for conditions leading \nto mitochondrial \u2022NO formation have been also reported. Peroxynitrite (the sum of ONOO- and ONOOH, p Ka = \n6.8) is an oxidizing and nitrating species that can cause \nmitochondrial dysfunction and trigger cell death. Indeed,  \nperoxynitrite is a pathogenic mediator in inflammation \nand degenerative diseases and it contributes to the aging \nprocess. In the presentation I will briefly comment on the \nfollowing aspects of mitochondrial O2\u2022- and peroxynitrite: \n1) mechanisms of generation, 2) key intramitochondrial \ntargets, 3) catabolic pathways and 4) redox-based thera -\npeutics. The talk will provide evidence at the in vitro  and \nin vivo  levels to underscore the role that O2\u2022- and per -\noxynitrite have in mitochondrial dysfunction and the relat -\ned opportunities for mitochondrial-targeted therapeutics.\nSIMPOSIO SAIC N\u00b07: WOMEN IN SCIENCE: ADVANCES IN IMMUNE RESPONSE TO CANCER AND \nANTITUMOR IMMUNOTHERAPY\nChair: Dra. Marianela Candolfi\nEPIGENETIC REPROGRAMMATION OF THE IMMUNE MICROENVIRONMENT IN BRAIN TUMORS: \nGRANULARITY AT THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL IMMUNE CELLS IN GENETIC MOUSE MODELS \nAND PATIENTS\nMaria G Castro\nDepartment of Neurosurgery and Cell and Developmental Biology, Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan Medical School, \nMutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase ( mIDH ) is a com -\nmon genetic lesion encountered in glioma patients. \nApproximately 90% of IDH1  mutations occur in exon \n4 at codon 132, resulting in a change of a single ami -\nno acid from arginine to histidine (R132H). Less com -\nmon IDH2  mutations occur in an analogous codon at \nposition R172. Although IDH1/2 mutations are always \nheterozygous, they exert a dominant gain of function \nenzymatic activity which leads to the production of 2-hy -\ndroxyglutarate (2HG). Excessive 2HG production causes \nDNA hypermethylation via inhibition of methylcytosine di -\noxygenase TET2, and also promotes histone hypermeth -\nylation through competitive inhibition of \u03b1-ketoglutarate \n(\u03b1KG)-dependent Jumonji-C histone demethylases. This \nleads to epigenetic reprogramming the transcriptome \nwithin the mIDH1  glioma cells (1). \n          Several studies suggested that mIDH1  may play \na critical role in shaping the immunological landscape \nof the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). We \ndemonstrate that mutant isocitrate-dehydrogenase 1 \n(mIDH1 ) synthetizes the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglu -\ntarate (2HG), which elicits epigenetic reprogramming of \nthe glioma cells\u2019 immune transcriptome leading to the \nreversion of the glioma immunosuppressive microenvi -\nronment (2). We show that the efficacy of immune-stim -\nulatory gene therapy (TK/Flt3L) is enhanced in mIDH1  \ngliomas, due to the reprogramming of the myeloid cells \ncompartment infiltrating the TME. We uncovered that the \nimmature myeloid cells-infiltrating the mIIDH1  TME are mainly non-suppressive neutrophils and pre-neutrophils. \nMyeloid cells\u2019 reprogramming was triggered by gran -\nulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) secreted by \nmIDH1  glioma stem-like cells. Blocking G-CSF in mIDH1 \nglioma-bearing mice restores the inhibitory potential of \nmyeloid cells, accelerating tumor progression. Also, we \ndemonstrate that G-CSF reprograms bone-marrow gran -\nulopoiesis resulting in non-inhibitory myeloid cells within \nmIDH1  glioma TME and enhancing the efficacy of im -\nmune-stimulatory gene therapy. In conclusion, out results \nuncover an important role of mIDH1  on reprogramming \nthe phenotypic and functional diversity of myeloid cells in \nglioma TME, a feature that can be harnessed to enhance \nthe efficacy of immunotherapies in glioma patients.\n1.

CIBICI-CONICET. Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3doba.\nAn important challenge in cancer immunotherapy is to \nexpand the number of patients that benefit from immune \ncheckpoint inhibitors blockade (CI), a fact that is associ -\nated with the pre-existence of an efficient anti-tumor im -\nmune infiltration. Different strategies are being proposed \nto be used in combined therapies with CI that could en -\nhance tumor infiltration and immunity. Competent type I \nIFN signaling underlies most anti-tumor immune mecha -nisms and has recently proven critical to the efficacy of \nseveral anticancer agents and immunotherapy.  In this \ntalk, we will discuss our recent findings regarding the \npotential of TLR3 agonists as type I-IFN inducers and \nconsequently, as strong modulators of the tumor infiltrate \ncomposition, capable of switching the immune suppres -\nsive tumor environment to anti-tumor immunity. \nDIFFERENTIAL GLYCOSYLATION OF TUMOR-ASSOCIATED IMMUNE CELLS CONTROLS \nTHEIR ACTIVITY AND RESISTANCE TO CANCER THERAPIES\nAda G. Blidner\nLaboratory of Glycomedicine and Immunopathology, Institute of Biology and Experimental Medicine, CONICET, CABA, Argentina.\nDuring this lecture we will discuss the role Galectin-Gly -\ncan interactions in tumor microenvironments, focusing \non the modulation of the immune cell compartment as \na crucial player in cancer progression and therapy resis -\ntance. During more than 20 years, the Laboratory of Gly -\ncomedicine and Immunopathology lay the foundations \nof the role of Galectin-1 as a positive regulator of tumor progression, including immune escape, angiogenesis \nand metastasis. Notably, we discovered that both pro-tu -\nmor and anti-tumor immune responses are sensitive to \nGal1 regulation, generating a comprehensive picture of \nthe mechanisms underlying Galectin-Glycan contribution \nto anti-angiogenic and Immunotherapy resistance. \nSTRATEGIES TO ENHANCE NATURAL KILLER ACTIVITY IN CANCER THERAPY.\nEstrella Mariel Levy\nCancer Research Center-Cancer Foundation, FUCA.\nNatural Killer (NK) cells are central components of innate \nimmunity. Because of their potential to induce direct cel -\nlular cytotoxicity without prior sensitization and release \nimmunostimulatory cytokines like IFN-\u03b3, NK cells have \nbeen shown to suppress both local tumor growth and \nmetastasis in animal models.\nNevertheless, NK cells display impaired functionality and \ncapability to infiltrate tumors in cancer patients. In our \ngroup, we observed altered phenotype and functionality \nin peripheral and tumor-associated NK cells from patients \nwith colorectal (CRC) and breast cancer (BC) (1-4). \nNK cells are feasible targets of stimulation to participate in \nimmunotherapeutic approaches like antibody (Ab)-based \nstrategies. In several medical scenarios, NK cells can be \nactivated by tumor-associated antigen-specific therapeu -\ntic Abs via CD16a-mediated ADCC effects. Cetuximab is \nan anti-EGFR chimeric mAb. We determined that altered \nNK cells in CRC patients can be activated by Cetuximab \nplus Il-2 or Il-15 (4). Also, we demonstrated that Cetux -\nimab triggers ADCC against Triple-negative BC (TNBC) cells (5). Moreover, we determined that Cetuximab op -\nsonization of TNBC cells increased a cross-talk between \nNK and dendritic cells (6).\nNowadays, several mAbs are being studied to block the \nPD-1/PD-L1 axis in different tumors; preliminary data \nfrom clinical trials presented promising results for pa -\ntients with advanced-stage/metastatic TNBC. Unlike oth -\ner anti-PD-L1 mAbs, Avelumab was designed as IgG1 \nto trigger ADCC against tumor cells. We demonstrated \nthat Avelumab significantly enhanced NK-cell mediat -\ned cytotoxicity against TNBC cells and that tumor cells \nexpressing higher levels of PD-L1 were more sensitive \nto Avelumab-mediated ADCC. Our study suggests that \nAvelumab-mediated ADCC, independently of the block -\nade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, could be a valuable \nmechanism for tumor cell elimination in TNBC (7).\nEmerging evidence suggests that a subset of NK cells \nhave adaptive immune features, including memory-like \nproperties, and enhanced Ab-dependent effector func -\ntions. Recently we identified and characterized an adap -MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Evidence rapidly accumu -\nlated documenting that this virus is the causal agent of \nKS, being necessary, albeit not sufficient for this disease \nto develop. Soon after this discovery, viral sequences \nwere also identified in a unique type of lymphoma, called \nprimary effusion lymphoma (PEL).  KSHV also causes \ntwo diseases that are associated with systemic symp -\ntoms due to increased production of cytokines: multi -\ncentric Castleman disease (MDC) and KSHV inflamma -\ntory cytokine syndrome (KICS). These are distinguished \nby the presence of systemic lymphadenopathy and char -\nacteristic features pathologic only in MCD. \nCurrently, most cases of KS occur in sub-Saharan Africa, \nwhere KSHV infection is prevalent owing to transmission \nby saliva in childhood, compounded by the ongoing AIDS epidemic. Treatment for early AIDS-related KS in previ -\nously untreated patients should start with the control of \nHIV with antiretrovirals, which frequently but not always \nresults in KS regression. In advanced-stage KS, chemo -\ntherapy is the most common treatment, but mortality is \nhigh. Diagnosis is challenging in Africa because of lim -\nited availability to pathology and immunohistochemistry. \nTo facilitate early diagnosis, we have been working on \ndeveloping a point-of-care molecular diagnostic assay \nbased on KSHV detection. In addition, in an attempt to \nimprove patient outcomes with KSHV associated diseas -\nes, we have been focusing on characterizing viral gene \nproducts that are expressed in most tumor cells (i.e. \nduring latency) and that play roles in oncogenesis. One \nof these is vFLIP, and an extensive effort to indentify in -\nhibitors of this viral protein are underway.   \nAIDS RELATED MALIGNANCIES IN TRANSGENDER WOMEN AND MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN \nIN ARGENTINA\nValeria Fink\nFundaci\u00f3n Hu\u00e9sped.

Since the first cases of AIDS \nassociated Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma were reported, science has made outstanding progress, in particular with the advent \nof the combined antiretroviral therapy, switching a deadly \ndisease to a chronic condition. However, cancer remains SYMPOSIA57\none of the main challenges for this population due to its \nmorbidity and mortality. \nMen who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender \nwomen (TGW) are the populations most affected by HIV \nin Argentina, with an estimated HIV prevalence of 12-\n15% and 34% respectively. Despite a national program \nwith access to HIV testing and treatment, the number of \nannual new HIV cases remains stable. Moreover, 30% \nof the new HIV diagnosis are late presenters, including people with AIDS defining cancers. \nAIDS related malignancies are related to oncogenic vi -\nruses, such as HPV, KSHV and EBV, which are more \nfrequent in MSM and TGW. Understanding the biology \nand epidemiology of these cancers is crucial for develop -\ning prevention strategies while ensuring access for HIV \nprevention, testing and treatment services, in particular \nfor key populations.\nMECHANISMS OF ONCOGENESIS BY GAMMAHERPESVIRUS / KSHV-ENCODED ANTIGENS \nMODULATE HIF1A LEVELS AND THE EPIGENETIC REPROGRAMMING OF INFECTED CELLS \nTO PROMOTE DNA REPLICATION\nErle Robertson\nHarry P. Schenck Professor / Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (USA)\nThe cellular adaptive response to hypoxia, mediated by \nhigh HIF1\u03b1 levels includes metabolic reprogramming, \nrestricted DNA replication and cell division. In contrast \nto healthy cells, the genome of cancer cells, and Ka -\nposi\u2019s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infect -\ned cells maintains replication in hypoxia. We show that \nKSHV infection, despite promoting expression of HIF1\u03b1 \nin normoxia, can also restrict transcriptional activity, and \npromoted its degradation in hypoxia. KSHV-encoded \nvCyclin, expressed in hypoxia, mediated HIF1\u03b1 cytosolic \ntranslocation, and its degradation through a non-canon -\nical lysosomal pathway. Attenuation of HIF1\u03b1 levels by \nvCyclin allowed cells to bypass the block to DNA replica -\ntion and cell proliferation in hypoxia. We demonstrated \nthat KSHV utilizes a unique strategy to balance HIF1\u03b1 \nlevels to overcome replication arrest and induction of the \noncogenic phenotype, which are dependent on the lev -\nels of oxygen in the microenvironment. Further studies \nhave also demonstrated that epigenetic reprogramming \nof KSHV genome in infected cell is essential for estab -\nlishment of latency by controlling viral gene expression. \nUnwinding of these epigenetic changes is necessary for \nreversal of the process of virus latency to induce produc -tive replication. The reversal of these epigenetic changes \nin physiologically allowed condition such as hypoxia has \nnot been previously studied in KSHV infected cells. Im -\nportantly, interdependence of host and viral epigenome \nremain ambiguous during viral reactivation under this \nphysiologically allowed state, and so we investigated \nthe epigenetic reprogramming of KSHV genome during \nhypoxic reactivation. We identified dramatic upregulated \nexpression of both transcription activating as well deac -\ntivating methylated histone marks especially, H3K4Me3, \nH3K9Me3 and H3K27Me3. The upregulation of these \nmodified histones are restricted to KSHV positive back -\nground suggesting a coordinated regulation by hypoxia \nand a KSHV-encoded antigen. KSHV-encoded RTA, \nvCyclin and vGPCR were shown to mediate the up-reg -\nulated expression of these modified histones.  Further, \nchromatin sequencing experiment with replication asso -\nciated proteins such as DNApol1\u03b1 or DNA modifications \nsuch as DNMTs showed qualitative enrichment on KSHV \ngenome rather higher expression or quantitative enrich -\nment. These studies provide new insight and add to our \nunderstanding of epigenetic reprogramming during hy -\npoxic reactivation of KSHV.\nSIMPOSIO SAI N\u00b0 6: NEW INSIGHTS INTO ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY\nChairs: Dr. Rub\u00e9n Motrich y Dra.

As a key mechanism of suppression, \nTreg-expressed CTLA-4 diminishes the expression of CD80/CD86 costimulatory ligands on antigen-presenting \ncells (APCs). However, the extrinsic function of CTLA-\n4 has not been fully elucidated yet. Here, we show that \nTreg-expressed CTLA-4 facilitated Treg-APC conjuga -\ntion and immune synapse formation. These Treg-APC MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 202158\nconjugates thus provided a stable platform whereby \nTregs were able to deplete CD80/CD86 proteins on \nAPCs by extracting them via CTLA-4-dependent trogo -\ncytosis. This depletion occurred even with Tregs only ex -\npressing a mutant tailless form of CTLA-4, which lacks \nthe cytoplasmic tail portion required for its endocytosis \nand cycling. The CTLA-4-dependent trogocytosis of \nCD80/CD86 also accelerated in vitro and in vivo passive \ntransfer of other membrane proteins and lipid molecules \nfrom APCs to Tregs without their significant reduction on \nthe APC surface. Furthermore, CD80 downregulation or \nblockade by Treg-expressed membrane form of CTLA-\n4 or soluble CTLA-4-immunoglobulin, respectively, dis -rupted cis-CD80/PD-L1 heterodimers and increased \nCD80-dissociated free PD-L1 on dendritic cells (DCs), \nexpanding a phenotypically distinct tolerogenic popu -\nlation of CD80lo free PD-L1hi DCs. Therefore, Treg-ex -\npressed CTLA-4 is able to exert dual suppressive effects \non T cell immune responses by directly limiting CD80/\nCD86 costimulatory signal to na\u00efve T cells and by indi -\nrectly increasing free PD-L1 available for the inhibition of \neffector T cells via CTLA-4-dependent trogocytosis. Fi -\nnally, our results imply that combined blockade of CTLA-\n4 and PD-1/PD-L1 may synergistically hinder Treg-medi -\nated immune suppression, thereby effectively enhancing \nimmune responses, including tumor immunity.\nUNDERSTANDING TYPE 1 DCS ACTIVITY AND SUPPRESSION IN LUNG CANCER\nFederica Benvenuti\nDepartment of Cellular Immunology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, (ICGEB), Trieste, Italia.\nAbstract not available\nBATF REGULATES PROGENITOR TO CYTOLYTIC EFFECTOR CD8 T CELL TRANSITION DURING \nCHRONIC VIRAL INFECTION\nWeiguo Cui\nDepartment of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.\nAbstract not available\nSIMPOSIO SAIC N\u00b09: TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH\nChair: Dra.

High-dose \n(HD)-XRT is well-known to debulk tumors, killing tumor \ncells and enhance the efficacy of CPI therapy through \ndisruption of the stroma and systemic priming of T cells. \nExposure of tumor cells to HD-XRT releases tumor-as -sociated antigens (TAAs), upregulates MHC class I mol -\necules, and activates the cGAS/STING pathway through \nDNA damage. However, disruption of the stroma by HD-\nXRT promotes recruitment of Tregs and myeloid derived \nsuppressor cells (MDSCs) and increased secretion of \nimmunosuppressive cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10. \nIn contrast, low doce (LD)-XRT, that lacks tumor killing \nproperties, modulates the stroma and TME, boosts the SYMPOSIA59\nimmune response and synergizes with CPI therapy. Key \nfindings on the effect of LD-XRT include : 1) increase of \nNK and T cell infiltration, 2) polarization of tumor associ -\nated macrophages from pro-tumorigenic M2 phenotype \ninto anti-tumor M1 phenotype, and 3) reduction of TGF-\u03b2 \nlevels. Consequently, LD-XRT can overcome limitations \nof CPI therapy. Moreover, in a phase 2 clinical trial in \nmelanoma patients the combination of CPI therapy (ipili -\nmumab) with LD-XRT and stereotactic ablative radiation \ntherapy (SBRT), lesions treated with LD-XRT respond -\ned better than un-irradiated lesions (31% vs. 5%, P = \n0.0091). In another prospective phase 2 clinical trial in \npatients with advanced metastatic tumors, where one \nmetastatic mass was treated with HD-XRT and dis -\ntant metastases were treated with LD-XRT during CPI therapy, we found that LD-XRT (4-7 Gy) delivered in 4 \nfractions to metastatic lesions increased the infiltration \nof immune cells and improved responses. The benefit of \nadding LD-XRT to HD-XRT was evident with (1) a 53% \nincrease of immune-related response [irRC] in irradiated \nlesions compared with unirradiated lesions (23% HD-\nXRT+LD-XRT and 11% HD-XRT), (2) extended median \nprogression-free survival (PFS) time (7.0 vs 5.8 months), \n(3) extended median overall survival (OS) time (15.9 vs \n10.5 months) and (4) increased T and NK immune cell \ninfiltration into irradiated lesions. In conclusi\u00f3n, LD-XRT \ncan enhance immunotherapy by increasing the infiltra -\ntion of T cells into irradiated solid tumors and overcome \nlimitations of CPI therapy.\nACCELERATING CLINICAL PROGRESS THROUGH TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH\nBob Bast\nDepartment of Experimental Therapeutics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA\nOver the last two decades in cancer research, progress \nin the laboratory has been exponential, whereas prog -\nress in the clinic has been more gradual and linear. The \nchallenge for translational cancer research is to acceler -\nate progress in the clinic by facilitating the flow of new \nideas and approaches from bench to bedside and of tis -\nsue and outcomes from bedside to bench, while moving \nmore effective treatment, detection and prevention into \nthe community. Precision cancer medicine brings togeth -\ner molecular diagnostics with molecular therapeutics to \nprovide the right combinations of traditional, targeted- \nand/or immuno-therapy for the right patient at the right \ntime to improve outcomes. \nTo accelerate progress, we must understand the in -\nter-tumor and intra-tumor complexity and heterogeneity \nof different cancers using \u201comic\u201d analysis of malignant \nand benign cells from multiple sites in primary and met -\nastatic cancers, requiring technology and bioinformatics. \n\u201cLiquid biopsies\u201d of circulating tumor DNA can integrate \nsampling from multiple sites. More than a thousand new \nanti-cancer agents are being evaluated in the clinic. As \nonly 1 of 8 anti-cancer drugs that enter clinical trials are \nultimately approved for use in the United States, more \npredictive models are required to estimate efficacy of \nnew agents. Considering that each cell line or xenograft \nis derived from a single patient, much larger numbers of \nmodels must be used. Insights into drug targets and tu -\nmor immunology, as well as most of the patients who en -\nter clinical trials, are found in Academe, while the ability \nto generate new agents and disseminate them worldwide \nare found in Pharma. Development of new agents might \noccur more rapidly and at lower cost, if Pharma and Aca -\ndeme collaborated more frequently through strategic al -\nliances or if the capacity for drug development were em -\nbedded in more cancer centers such as MD Anderson. \nNumerous drugs, antibodies and immune cells are now available to target particular abnormalities in cancers \nfrom a single organ or from multiple organ sites. In a frac -\ntion of cancer patients, individual drugs can be paired \nwith molecular abnormalities, improving outcomes to \nsome extent. With rare but important exceptions such \nas chronic myelogenous leukemia, however, effective \ntreatment of most malignancies will require combinations \nof targeted agents. Relevant combinations have been \nsought through synthetic lethality, collateral lethality and \ncombinatorial adaptive resistance therapy. Evaluation of \ncombinations requires access to large numbers of pa -\ntients whose cancers can be genotypically and pheno -\ntypically tested to identify subsets who could potentially \nbenefit. Biomarkers have been used for their positive pre -\ndictive value to identify patients more likely to respond. \nEmphasis could also be placed on identifying biomarkers \nwith negative predictive value to identify individuals who \nwould not benefit, saving patients toxicity, time and tens \nof billions of dollars.\nTranslational cancer research requires steady funding. \nThe majority comes from Pharma, supplemented with \ngovernmental and philanthropic sources. Limited fund -\ning mandates that we must choose our laboratory ex -\nperiments and clinical trials with care, developing truly \nnovel agents and choosing clinical trials that will change \nthe standard of care.  We must also support career de -\nvelopment and retention of physician-scientists and cli -\nnician-investigators who are increasingly endangered \nspecies, one of the priorities at my own cancer center. \nMulti-disciplinary teams must be built and maintained. \nThis effort must define the role of all treatment modali -\nties. Academic institutions need to be more deliberate in \ncatalyzing and rewarding translational research through \nprograms such as the Moon Shots. Translational re -\nsearch is key to accelerating development of precision \ncancer medicine to eliminate the impact of the disease.MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

To this end we performed \na genetic screen using an shRNA library against UPS \ngenes and analyzed alterations in the migrating potential \nof breast cancer (BC) cells.\nAfter the selection process, we characterized the non-mi -\ngrating population and obtained a list of 30 candidate \nregulator genes. We focused on two genes, USP19 and \nHERC1, whose role in tumor cell migration and invasion \nwas not previously described. Our results demonstrated that silencing of these genes reduces the migratory/in -\nvasive potential of different BC cell lines. We extended \nour investigation in vivo  and confirmed that mice injected \nwith USP19 or HERC1 depleted cells display increased \ntumor-free survival, as well as a delay in the onset of \nthe tumor formation and a significant reduction in the ap -\npearance of metastatic foci. Finally, we performed a ret -\nrospective clinical study for USP19 and an in silico  study \nfor HERC1. Our analysis showed that USP19 protein ex -\npression is a prognostic predictor of distant relapse free \nsurvival in BC patients and reveal the existence of an in -\nverse correlation between HERC1 expression levels and \nbreast cancer patients\u2019 overall survival. Altogether our \ndata provide solid evidence indicating that both USP19 \nand HERC1 might represent novel prognostic and thera -\npeutic targets in breast cancer.\nPUBLIC TRANSCRIPTOMIC DATASETS, GREAT TOOLS TO DO SCIENCE WITHOUT MONEY\nJuan Bayo Fina\nLaboratorio de Terapia Genica, Instituto de Investigaciones en Medicina Traslacional, Universidad Austral-CONICET. \njmbayo@hotmail.com\nThe advent of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has \nled to a better understanding of the pathophysiological process bridging to a new era of molecular pathology \nand personalized medicine.

Mar\u00eda Marta Amaral\nGUT MICROBIOTA-METABOLOME ASSOCIATED TO STEC INFECTIONS\nPablo Gallardo1, Mariana Izquierdo1, Roberto M. Vidal2, and Mauricio J.

Intestinal microbiota and metabolites have \nbeen proposed to be responsible for the maintenance of \nintestinal homeostasis and prevention of colonization by \nenteric pathogens, such as diarrheagenic Escherichia \ncoli (DEC). Among these metabolites, short-chain fatty \nacids (SCFA) are the most abundant products of bac -\nterial fermentation, and their role in the development of \ndiarrheal disease is controversial. Although different in -\nvestigations have granted a protective factor to SCFA, \nothers have linked them to an increase in the expression \nof virulence factors of enteric pathogens, and possibly \nfavor the infection process. \nMethodology.  SCFA levels were determined in stool \nsamples of children under 5 years of age. 30 diarrhe -\nal samples positive for a DEC pathotype and 38 stool \nsamples of healthy children were analyzed. The concen -\ntration of the SCFA acetate, propionate and butyrate in \nthe stool samples was determined by high performance \nliquid chromatography (HPLC). Additionally, the V3-V4 \nregion of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced for taxo -\nnomic classification.\nResults . From microbiota analysis we obtained that \nthe diarrheal samples presented a distinctive compo -\nsition with respect to the control samples. Similar re -\nsults were obtained in STEC positive samples (n=11) \ncompared to other pathotypes and to control samples.  \nA lower bacterial diversity was found in diarrheal sam -\nples, (regardless of the pathotype), when compared to \nthe control group. A higher proportion of Proteobacteria  and a lower proportion of Firmicutes  and Bacteroidetes \nwas found in diarrheal samples, compared to the control \ngroup. Compared to healthy children, higher total levels \nof propionate-producing bacteria were found in diarrheal \nsamples, highlighting the genus Veillonella  sp. (4.9% vs. \n0.2%, p= 0.014) and with respect to acetate production, \nan increase was observed in the genus Streptococcus  \nsp. (3.9% vs 0.6% p< 0.001).\nIn diarrheal samples, higher levels of acetate, propio -\nnate and butyrate were found compared to samples from \nhealthy children. Acetate levels on stool samples were \nsignificantly higher in STEC positive samples, compared \nto the control group. Regardless of the presence of the \ntwo SCFA producing genera in higher proportions in diar -\nrheal samples compared to the control group, a positive \ncorrelation was found between levels of acetate produc -\ners ( Akkermansia , Blautia  and Ruminococcus) , propio -\nnate producers ( Coprococcus , Phascolarctobacterium  \nand Roseburia) , and butyrate producer ( Anaerostipes \nand Coprococcus).\nConclusions : We found a characteristic microbiota as -\nsociated with diarrheal samples positive for DEC, as well \nas positive for STEC. We found a significant increase in \nSCFA levels of diarrheal samples compared to stools of \nhealthy children. SCFA levels could be associated with \nthe presence of SCFA-producing bacteria, regardless of \nthe abundance of the involved taxas.

Single chain fragment variable (scFv) is the format \nwhere the VH and VL are joined by a flexible peptide \nlinker to prevent their dissociation. Besides the variable \nchains, Fab fragments have one constant region in each \nchain. Both fragments retain the parental IgG specific an -\ntigen-binding affinity. Recombinant antibodies fragments \ntargeting Stx1 and/or Stx2 were produced in bacteria \nand have been comprehensively studied. The scFvStx1 \nand scFvStx2 genes were constructed on the basis of \nmurine hybridoma (mAb 3E2) secreting Stx1 or (mAb \n2E11) Stx2 IgG monoclonal antibodies. Both scFv were \ncoupled to latex nanoparticles and provide a toxin assay \nwith a competitive Stx detection limit of 30 ng/mL for Stx1 \nand 10 ng/mL for Stx2, which has low cost and can be \nperformed in a short-term time. For the therapeutic ap -\nproach, four Fab fragments were selected against Stx1 \nand Stx2 from human phage display library, and showed \nthe following dissociation constants analyzed by surface plasmon resonance: B6 4X10-8 M and C8 1X10-8 M, both \nspecific against Stx1, F8 1X10-8 M specific against Stx2 \nand the C11 which cross-recognizes both toxins with an \naffinity of 7X10-9 M to Stx2 toxin and 3X10-8 M to Stx1. \nThe cross-reaction of FabC11 is due to the binding epi -\ntope GKIEFSKYNEDDTF, localized on subunit B of both \ntoxins. The Fabs neutralizing ability was tested either \nemploying purified toxins or bacterial supernatants in \nrenal (Vero and HK-2) and glomerular cells (HGEC) as -\nsays. Considering different ranges of neutralization, the \nFabF8 and FabC11 neutralized the cytotoxicity in 90 and \n100% of the Stx2 producing strains, respectively. Also, \nthe FabB6 and FabC8 were able to neutralize the cy -\ntotoxicity in 50 and 85% of the Stx1 producing strains, \nrespectively. Moreover, the FabC11 was able to prevent \nStx2 toxicity to human kidney cells and in mice. This neu -\ntralizing capacity seems to involve receptor binding site \nblocking, preventing the translocation of effective subunit \nA into the target cells. Taken together, our results indicate \nthe recombinant fragments are promising molecules to \nbe used therapeutically against Stx1 and Stx2 intoxica -\ntion, as well as for rapid screening detection of Stx pro -\nducing strains.\nHEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME: NEW INSIGHTS AND NEW CHALLENGES \nFOR CLINICAL MANAGEMENT\nAlejandro Balestracci\nUnidad de Nefrolog\u00eda, Hospital General de Ni\u00f1os Pedro de Elizalde, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nHemolytic uremic syndrome related to Shiga-toxin-pro -\nducing Escherichia coli  (STEC-HUS) is a thrombotic mi -\ncroangiopathy characterized by thrombocytopenia, acute \nkidney injury, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. \nSTEC-HUS can be a life-threatening condition requiring \nprompt diagnosis and treatment: it is one of the leading \ncauses of acute renal injury in the pediatric population, \nmortality rates can reach up to 5% and long-term renal \nsequelae remains, on average, around 30%. Remark -\nably, Argentina is the country with the highest incidence \nof this disease in the world, where it generates a great \nimpact on public health. \nAfter STEC infection there is no effective intervention \ncapable of decreasing the risk of developing the dis -\nease; however, the interval between diarrhea onset and \nprogression to HUS may represent a window for inter -ventions which could optimize the likelihood of good \noutcomes. Among them, the importance of early identi -\nfication of STEC infection, the relevance of maintaining \na well hydration status during the prodromal phase and \nanalysis of the different accepted case definitions ac -\ncepted will be discussed. \nAfter the diagnosis of STEC-HUS, rapid identification of \nhigh-risk patients can optimize their management and, \nalthough treatment of the disease remains supportive, \nrecent evidence provides the rationale for changing the \nfluid management approach and for the off-label use of \neculizumab (a monoclonal antibody against the termi -\nnal complement component 5 ). In this conference, clini -\ncal and laboratory markers of poor prognosis and the role \nof new treatment interventions will be analyzed.\nAt last, as mentioned above, a high proportion of acute SYMPOSIA63\nphase survivors develop chronic kidney disease, being \nthe most important risk factor for such an outcome is \nthe length of the oligoanuric period. However, even pa -\ntients who had not undergone dialysis might exhibit renal \ndamage during follow-up. Of concern, the progression \nis variable, with some patients never recovering normal \nrenal function and others experiencing a secondary de -cline, sometimes after a period of apparent recovery. In \nthis conference, the role of baseline urinary transforming \ngrowth factor 1 (TGF\u03b2-1) levels in predicting short-term \nrenal outcomes and the potential role of uric acid as new \nadditional factor that can aggravate the injury caused by \nthe microangiopathic process will be presented based on \nstudies of our own.\nSHIGA TOXIN-ENCODING PROPHAGES OF E. COLI  O157: EVOLUTION, REGULATION AND LINK TO \nHUMAN DISEASE\nDavid L Gally\nThe Roslin Institute & Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh, UK.\nWhile it is evident that specific sub-types of Shiga toxin \ncan be associated with more serious pathology, there is \nless known about whether the prophage context of these \ntoxins in specific strain backgrounds can influence the \nlevels of toxin produced. In Scotland we have higher lev -\nels of EHEC O157 infections than in the rest of Great \nBritain (England & Wales) and we now know this is due \nto higher prevalence of Lineage 1c E. coli  O157 strains \nexpressing the Stx2a toxin. This toxin is often present \nin strains that also encode Stx2c, but Stx2a is the pre -\ndominant toxin produced, with and without Mitomycin C \ninduction, and this is due to differences in the prophages \nand their kinetics that encode the different toxin genes.  \nMoreover, during non-induced conditions we show that \nStx2a toxin is expressed from the prophage while nearby \nlysin genes are not, so there is a level of RecA-mediat -\ned toxin induction with toxin release most likely through \nouter membrane vesicles (OMVs). This is supported by recent studies and by the fact that both the Shiga toxin \nA&B subunits have their own predicted Sec signal pep -\ntides to move them into the periplasm. In line with some \nearlier studies, we show that the most of the main E. \ncoli O157 lineages and sub-lineages constantly gener -\nate large chromosome re-arrangements (LCRs) which \nare bounded by prophage regions. For our UK strains, \nthe Stx2c-encoding prophage is a main protagonist in \nsuch re-arrangements.  We propose that this and similar \nprophages may be \u2018self-harming\u2019, actually producing a \nDNA cleaving enzyme that leads to a SOS induction in \norder to drive expression of an activated RecA regulon \nthat includes Shiga toxin. LCRs are then the by-product \nof such constant RecABCD repair activity.  We propose \nthat this \u2018background\u2019 activity is important for the relative \ntoxicity of a strain in the absence of external activators of \nthe SOS response such as particular antibiotics. \nSIMPOSIO SAIC N\u00b012: RNAM METABOLISM IN DISEASE: RNA POL II IS NOT ALONE\nChair: Dr. Juan Miguel Bayo Fina\nKAP1 A SIGNALING HUB FOR TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL IN CANCER\nIv\u00e1n D\u2019Orso\nDepartment of Microbiology, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center\nPrecise control of the RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) \ncycle, including pausing and pause release, maintains \ntranscriptional homeostasis and organismal functions. \nDespite previous work to understand individual transcrip -\ntion steps, we reveal a mechanism that integrates RNA \nPol II cycle transitions. Surprisingly, KAP1/ TRIM28 uses \na previously uncharacterized chromatin reader cassette \nto bind hypo-acetylated histone 4 tails at promoters, \nguaranteeing continuous progression of RNA Pol II entry \nto and exit from the pause state. Upon chromatin dock -\ning, KAP1 first associates with RNA Pol II and then re -cruits a pathway-specific transcription factor (SMAD2/3) \nin response to cognate ligands, enabling gene-selective \nCDK9-dependent pause release. This coupling mech -\nanism is exploited by tumor cells to aberrantly sustain \ntranscriptional programs commonly dysregulated in \ncancer patients. The discovery of a factor integrating \ntranscription steps expands the functional repertoire by \nwhich chromatin readers operate and provides mecha -\nnistic understanding of transcription regulation, offering \nalternative therapeutic opportunities to target transcrip -\ntional dysregulation.MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 202164\nKAPOSI\u2019S SARCOMA-ASSOCIATED HERPESVIRUS ORF57 PROTEIN PROTECTS VIRAL TRANSCRIPTS \nFROM TWO HOST-MEDIATED RNA DECAY PATHWAYS THAT MODULATE VIRAL GENE EXPRESSION\nJulio C. Ruiz; Olga Hunter; Nicholas K. Conrad\nDepartment of Microbiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas TX\nIn eukaryotes, nuclear RNAs are subject to a number of \nRNA decay pathways that serve quality control and reg -\nulatory functions. Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvi -\nrus (KSHV) is a human pathogen that expresses its genes \nin the nucleus using the host machinery. Consequently, \nKSHV evolved mechanisms that allow its transcripts to \nevade host nuclear RNA decay pathways. The multifunc -\ntional KSHV ORF57 (Mta) protein increases the nuclear \nstability of viral transcripts by protecting them from cellular \nRNA quality control pathways. However, neither the RNA \ndecay pathway(s) inhibited by ORF57 nor the mechanism \nby which ORF57 protects viral RNAs from degradation is \nknown. In the absence of ORF57, we show that viral tran -\nscripts are subject to degradation by two specific nuclear \nRNA decay pathways, PABPN1 and PAP\u03b1/\u03b3-mediated \nRNA decay (PPD) in which decay factors are recruited \nthrough poly(A) tails, and an ARS2-mediated RNA decay \npathway dependent on the 5\u00b4 RNA cap. In transcription \npulse chase assays, ORF57 appears to act primarily by inhibiting the ARS2-mediated RNA decay pathway. In the \ncontext of viral infection in cultured cells, inactivation of \nboth decay pathways by RNAi is necessary for the res -\ntoration of a subset of specific ORF57-dependent viral \ngenes produced from an ORF57-null bacmid. Mechanis -\ntically, our data suggest that the ORF57 interaction with \nALYREF protects certain viral transcripts by preventing \nthe recruitment of the exosome co-factor hMTR4. Howev -\ner, other KSHV transcripts are stabilized by ORF57 in an \nALYREF-independent fashion. Interestingly, global viral \ntranscriptome analysis revealed a widespread increase in \nKSHV gene expression when both decay pathways were \ninactivated simultaneously. The transcripts that accumu -\nlated included known ORF57-dependent RNAs as well \nas many RNAs that are not dramatically changed upon \nORF57 depletion. These viral transcriptome analyses \nsuggest that PPD and ARS2-mediated RNA decay path -\nways appear to play broader and more complex roles in \nKSHV gene expression.\nTRANSCRIPTIONAL REPROGRAMMING OF THE MALARIA PARASITE  \nKrista A. Matthews and Elisabeth D. Martinez\nDepartment of Pharmacology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas\nPlasmodium falciparum (Pf)  is the most lethal of the five \nspecies of malaria affecting 3.4 billion humans annual -\nly. Proper transcriptional regulation at each stage of the \nPf life cycle is essential for the successful completion of \nthe life cycle, for gametocytogenesis and for red blood \ncell invasion. Epigenetic enzymes are thought to play im -\nportant and potentially essential roles in this regulation. \nThe methylation state of histones at specific genomic \nloci, for example, controls the expression of stage-spe -\ncific transcription factors such as AP2-G, of nutrient up -\ntake channels including the Clag3 gene paralogs, and of \npathological multi-gene families such as the highly viru -\nlent var genes that encode adhesion proteins involved \nin antigenic variation. These loci are kept transcription -\nally repressed by trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone 3 \n(H3K9me3). Proper temporal activation of these loci or \nswitching to a distinct gene form for antigenic variation \nrequires  the enzymatic deletion of this H3K9me3 tran -\nscriptional silencing mark. Similarly, proper temporal \nrepression of active genes marked by H3K4me3 such \nas transcriptionally active stage-specific genes or mo -\nno-allelic loci for gene switching, requires erasing the \nactivating H3K4me3 mark. Demethylation of trimethylat -ed histones such as H3K9me3 or H3K4me3 can only be \ncarried out by Jumonji domain containing histone hydrox -\nylases. No other proteins with this activity are known to \ndate. The Pf genome encodes three Jumonji hydroxy -\nlases: PfJmjC1, PfJmjC2 and Jmj3. Using a small mol -\necule screening approach, we have identified potential \nepigenetic vulnerabilities driven by candidate Jumonji \nhistone demethylating enzymes in the malaria parasite  \nPlasmodium falciparum . We show that inhibitors of mam -\nmalian JmjC histone demethylases kill asexual blood \nstage parasites and are even more potent at blocking \ngametocyte development and gamete formation. In late \nstage parasites, exposure to demethylase inhibitors re -\nsults in increased levels of tri-methylated lysine residues \non histones suggesting inhibition of Pf Jumonji demeth -\nylase activity. These epigenetic defects coincide with \nderegulation of invasion, cell motor, and sexual develop -\nment gene programs, including gene targets coregulated \nby the PfAP2-I transcription factor and chromatin-binding \nfactor, PfBDP1. Our pharmacological studies of Jumonji \nactivity in the malaria parasite provide evidence that in -\nhibition of these enzymatic activities is detrimental to the \nparasite.SYMPOSIA65\nRNAPII DEGRADATION IN RESPONSE TO UV-INDUCED DNA DAMAGE\nJuan C. Mu\u00f1oz1, In\u00e9s Beckerman1, Le\u00f3n A. Bouvier2, Manuel J. Mu\u00f1oz1,3\n1IFIBYNE-UBA-CONICET, Argentina.\n 2IIB-UNSAM-CONICET, Argentina.\n3 FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology (IFOM), Italy.\nDNA damage caused naturally by UV light exposure in \nskin cells triggers not only lesion repair mechanisms but \nalso a global gene expression response that includes \nRNAPII degradation. Recent identification of the lysine \nresidue responsible for RNAPII ubiquitination and degra -\ndation uncovered an unanticipated relevance for RNAPII \nlevels in the control of gene expression in UV-treated \ncells. \nSince DNA is the only biopolymer that is neither dis -\nposable nor recyclable, it must be repaired when dam -\naged. Among the various repair systems that human \ncells have, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system \nis the one that deals with most of UV light-induced le -\nsions. Damage detection by NER system occurs by two \ndifferent DNA-sensing mechanisms that then converge \non the same machinery that repairs the damage: tran -\nscription-coupled repair (TC-NER) and global genome \nrepair (GG-NER). The \u201clast resort\u201d model states that a \nRNAPII molecule stalled in front of a UV-induced DNA \nlesion is degraded so as to allow access to the repair \nmachinery and, therefore, RNAPII degradation would \nbe part of the TC-NER system. However, different evi -dences suggest that the scenario could be different. On \nthe one hand, most of the repair of lesions in template \nstrands in transcriptionally active genes, the only lesions \nrepaired by TC-NER, occurs in the first hours post UV, \nwhile degradation of RNAPII is observed hours later. On \nthe other hand, preliminary results from our group show \nthat RNAPII degradation is mainly controlled by the GG-\nNER system. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing system, \nwe generated human keratinocytes unable to recognize \nlesions through the GG-NER system (GG-NER KO / TC-\nNER WT cells) and observed a marked inhibition in the \ndegradation of RNAPII in response to UV light. Moreover, \nimpairment of the actual lesion-repair, but its lesion rec -\nognition, enhanced RNAPII degradation. While in GG-\nNER KO cells we observed less RNAPII degradation and \nenhanced cell viability upon UV, in comparison to wild \ntype keratinocytes, in different lesion-repair mutant cells \nwe observed the opposite: enhanced RNAPII degrada -\ntion and reduced cell viability upon UV. Consequently, we \npropose that RNAPII levels determine cell viability and \nare mainly controlled by an unexplored GG-NER-depen -\ndent mechanism. \nSIMPOSIO SAIC N\u00b013: TOXICOLOGY AND HEALTH, NEW PERSPECTIVES FOR THE FUTURE\nChairs: Dra. Claudia Cocca y Dra. Andrea Randi\nORGANIC FOOD: IS THERE ANY RISK BEYOND PESTICIDES?\nMontse Marqu\u00e9s, Neus Gonz\u00e1lez, Mart\u00ed Nadal, Jos\u00e9 L. Domingo\nUniversitat Rovira i Virgili, Laboratory of Toxicology and Environmental Health, School of Medicine, Reus, Catalonia, Spain.\nIn recent years, there is a global increasing tendency \nto consume organic foods instead of the convention -\nal foodstuffs. It is mainly due to the concern raised by \nthe potential adverse health effects derived from the in -\ntake of pesticides, fertilizers, hormones and antibiotics, \nwhich are widely used in conventional food production. \nAlthough organic label forbids the use of these products, \nenvironmental contamination can also occur in organic \nfoodstuffs. The main purpose of this literature review was \nto compare the levels of a number of environmental pol -\nlutants such as polychlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins and \ndibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls \n(PCBs), mycotoxins, trace elements, or polycyclic aro -\nmatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in organic and conventional \nfood items. In general terms, the presence of nearby an -\nthropogenic sources of pollution might be the key issue \ninfluencing the occurrence of environmental pollutants in \nfoodstuffs, regardless their organic or conventional ori -\ngin. However, few studies concluded that he concentra -\ntions of environmental pollutants might vary according to \nthe production system. Specifically, the concentrations of PCBs, HBCD, PBDEs and heavy metals are higher in \norganic than conventional meat. Likewise, the concentra -\ntions of heavy metals are lower in organic fruits and veg -\netables than those in conventional production. Regarding \nmilk and dairy products, higher concentrations of PCBs \nand aflatoxin M1 have been reported in organic than in \nthe conventional ones. In turn, organic milks show lower \nconcentrations of essential elements than conventional \nones, while no differences were found in the levels of \ntoxic elements according to the production system. Sim -\nilarly, the occurrence of mycotoxins in cereals does not \nvary depending on the production system. With respect \nto heavy metals, Cd and Pb levels are higher in organic \ncereals than in conventional ones. In contrast, the con -\ncentrations of Hg, Zn and Cu are higher in conventional \nthan in organic cereals. The occurrence of PCDDs and \nPCBs is lower in organic eggs than those from conven -\ntional production. Based on the above, environmental \ncontaminants should be monitored in both conventional \nand organic foods. Moreover, the safety feature, which \nhas been globally attributed to the consumption of organ -MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 202166\nic foods, might be questionable depending on the poten -\ntial environmental contamination of these foodstuffs.\nBased on this, we suggest that environmental contami -\nnants should be monitored in both conventional and or -ganic foods. Finally, the safety feature, which has been \nglobally attributed to organic foods, might be question -\nable depending on the potential environmental contami -\nnation of these foods.\nCHLORPYRIFOS-INDUCED MOLECULAR MECHANISMS INVOLVED \nIN BREAST CANCER PROGRESSION.\nMarianela Lasagna,1-2 Mar\u00eda Soledad Hielpos,1-2 Clara Ventura,3 Mariana Mardirosian,1 Gabriela Martin,2 Noelia Miret,2-4 \nAndrea Randi,4 Mariel Nu\u00f1ez,2 Claudia Cocca 1-2 \nInstituto de Qu\u00edmica y Fisicoqu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gicas \u201cProf. Alejandro C.

CPF is currently considered an Endocrine Dis -\nruptor (ED). EDs have been associated with the progres -\nsion and metastasis of established breast tumors and \nwere pointed out as potential inductors of the epithelial \nmesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we inves -\ntigate whether CPF promotes molecular mechanisms \ninvolved in breast cancer progression. Our experiments \nwere performed using MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell \nlines, and two CPF concentrations (0.05 and 50 \u00b5M). We \nevaluated the migration and invasion using 2D and 3D \nmodels, as well as the expression of EMT biomarkers.  \nWe show that 50 \u03bcM CFP induces invasion in MCF-7 and \nMDA-MB-231 cells ( p<0.001) in 2D cultures. In MCF-\n7-3D culture, we observe that 0.05 \u00b5M CPF increases \nthe invasion area after 7-day ( p<0.01) and 50 \u00b5M CPF \ninduces the invasion area after 5-( p<0.05) and 7-day \n(p<0.001) when collagen type 1 was used as matrix mod -\nel. When Matrigel\u00ae was used as substrate, we observe \nthat only 0.05 \u00b5M CPF increases the invasion area after \n2-(p<0.05), 5-( p<0.01) and 7-day ( p<0.001). In MCF-7 \ncells, 0.05 \u00b5M CPF induces the migration in 2D models \nafter 48 h ( p<0.01) that was reversed adding IC182,780 and PP2 together ( p<0.001). 50 \u00b5M CPF ( p<0.001) pro -\nmotes the migration in c-SRC-dependent way ( p<0.001). \nIn addition, we found that 0.05 and 50 \u03bcM CPF increases \nthe migration area in the spheroid in a ER\u03b1-dependent \nmanner ( p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). CPF at 0.05 \n\u00b5M induces an increment of the number and the area of \nMS1 and MS2 in MCF-7 cells. ( p<0.05, p<0.001, respec -\ntively). This effect offset by ICI 182,780 ( p<0.001) and \nPP2 ( p<0.05). Finally, in MCF-7 cells, 0.05 and 50 \u03bcM \nCPF increase the metalloprotease MMP2 expression \n(p<0.001) and decrease E-Cadherin and \u03b2-Catenin ex -\npression ( p<0.01) diminishing their membrane location. \nCPF at 50 \u03bcM induces Vimentin expression and Slug \nnuclear translocation in MCF-7 cells. 0.05 and 50 \u03bcM \nCPF increase MMP2 gelatinolytic activity and expression \n(p<0.05, p<0.001, respectively), decrease \u03b2-Catenin \nexpression ( p<0.01) and increase Vimentin expression \n(p<0.05) in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results show that \nCPF modulates EMT-molecular markers, promotes mi -\ngration and invasion in breast cancer cells in 2D and 3D \ncultures.  Also, CPF at 0.05 \u00b5M induces the stemness \nphenotype. These data support that CPF may represent \na risk factor for breast cancer progression. \nTOXICODYNAMICS OF FINE PARTICULATE MATTER IN SUSPENSION (PM2.5) IN HEALTHY ANIMAL \nMODELS AND WITH ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION\nTavera Busso, Iv\u00e1n; Carreras, Hebe Alejandra\nLaboratorio de Contaminaci\u00f3n y Bioindicadores, Instituto Multidisciplinario de Biolog\u00eda Vegetal, Consejo Nacional de Investiga -\nciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas y Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, F\u00edsicas y Naturales, Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba.\nAccording to the WHO, 9 out of 10 people breathe polluted \nair, and more than 7 million die prematurely because of \nit. Fine suspended particulate matter (PM2.5) is one of the \nmost relevant indicators when estimating this impact since \nexposure to PM2.5 is often chronic, and it induces nega -\ntive effects even at low concentrations. This is related to its \nhighly random composition, high surface area, persistence \nin the atmosphere, and high penetration in the respiratory \nsystem.\nOnce in the body, PM2.5 causes histological changes, which \ncan be intensified by the activation of response mecha -nisms. According to the tissue, particles can irritate by \nmechanical or chemical action, activate the immune sys -\ntem, and promote the release of pro-inflammatory and va -\nsoconstrictor mediators. In the cellular environment, PM2.5 \nconstituents trigger the production of free radicals causing \noxidative stress, formation of DNA adducts, activation of \nthe endoplasmic reticulum\u2019s unfolded proteins response, \nand apoptosis. These events lead to macroscopic changes \nthat promote the setting or exacerbation of diseases since \nparticles do not restrict to the target organs.\nTherefore, many studies still focus on the PM2.5 action SYMPOSIA67\nmechanisms, although these do not always simulate real \nexposure conditions, and only a few comprehensively ad -\ndress the pathogenesis. Furthermore, a small number of \nthem studied how PM2.5 particles affect organisms with \npre-existing pathological conditions, such as hyperten -\nsion. On the other hand, the PM2.5 toxic potential is closely \nrelated to its composition, which depends on the emission \nsources, most of which are specific from each society.\nLocal studies have demonstrated that long-term expo -sure to low levels of PM2.5 (< 25 \u00b5g m-3) induces serum \nand histological alterations in lungs, liver, and kidneys, \nand changes in tissues\u2019 elemental composition in both \nanimal models. These effects tend to exacerbate when \nparticles levels are higher, mainly in hypertensive ani -\nmals. Therefore, it can be expected that sustained ex -\nposure to PM2.5, even at low particles levels, significantly \naffects the life quality of individuals, especially those who \nhave a hypertensive disease.\nGLYPHOSATE HERBICIDE: CARCINOGENIC POTENTIAL AND REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY\nJorgelina Varayoud, Virginia Lorenz, Marlise Guerrero Schimpf, Mar\u00eda Paula Gastiazoro, Mar\u00eda Victoria Zanardi, Milena \nDurando, Mar\u00eda Mercedes Milesi. \nInstituto de Salud y Ambiente del Litoral (ISAL), CONICET-Universidad Nacional del Litoral (UNL), Facultad de Bioqu\u00edmica y \nCiencias Biol\u00f3gicas, UNL.\nGlyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the most wide -\nly applied pesticides in the world and are mainly used in \nassociation with GBH-tolerant crop varieties. Indiscrimi -\nnate and negligent use of GBHs has promoted the emer -\ngence of glyphosate resistant weeds, and consequently \nthe rise in the use of these herbicides. In addition, alarm -\ningly increased levels of glyphosate, the active ingredient \nof all GBHs, have been detected in environmental matrix -\nes and in foodstuff, becoming a matter of social concern. \nGBHs are composed of glyphosate and other chemicals \nknown as co-formulants which enhance the herbicide \naction. Currently, the safety of glyphosate and its for -\nmulations remain to be a controversial issue. In 2015, \nthe World Health Organization classified glyphosate as \na \u201ccarcinogen type 2a\u201d or a probable human carcinogen; \nhowever, nowadays its carcinogenic potential is under \ndiscussion. Our research work focused on investigating \nwhether glyphosate or GBH could exhibit carcinogenic \npotential and/or impair female fertility and fetal/placen -\ntal growth. We performed in vitro  and in vivo  studies to \nevaluate the effects and elucidate the mechanisms of \naction of the herbicide. For in vivo  studies, we exposed \nfemale rats during high sensitivity periods of life (perina -tal and/or early postnatal period), and the effects were \ntested at adulthood. We analyzed endocrine disrupting \nendpoints and epigenetic markers using different exper -\nimental conditions focusing our attention on the uterus. \nThe results indicate that glyphosate and GBH produce \nfemale subfertility by impairing the implantation process, \nand induce fetal growth retardation in their offspring. \nBoth compounds show endocrine disrupting effects me -\ndiated, at least in part, by epigenetic dysregulation of key \ngenes involved in uterine functional differentiation. Re -\ngarding carcinogenic potential, we found: i) higher sen -\nsitivity to 17 \u03b2-estradiol in uterine tissue, ii) induction of \npreneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in mammary gland, \nuterus and vagina, and iii) stimulation of epithelial mes -\nenchymal transition-related changes via ER-dependent \npathway in Ishikawa cells. In conclusion, we provide ev -\nidence on adverse reproductive outcomes and carcino -\ngenic properties of the herbicide. As our results indicate \nsimilar effects after glyphosate and GBH treatment, the \nactive principle might be responsible for the deleterious \neffects. Epidemiological studies are a priority to evaluate \npossible deleterious effects on human health. \nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF CHLORPYRIFOS TO AQUATIC LIFE, WILDLIFE AND HUMAN  HEALTH. \nCONSEQUENCES AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES.\nAna M. Pechen\nCentro de Investigaciones en Toxicolog\u00eda Ambiental y Agrobiotecnolog\u00eda del Comahue (CITAAC). \nUniversidad Nacional del Comahue-CONICET.\nChlorpyrifos (CPY) is one of the insecticides most widely \nused throughout the world to limit insect and mite dam -\nage to a number of important crops, including soybeans, \ncorn, tree, nuts, wheat, alfalfa citrus and vegetables. The \nfate and movement of CPY and its metabolite chlorpyr -\nifos-oxon (CPYO) determine exposure in terrestrial and \naquatic environments. Detectable concentrations of CPY \nin air, rain, snow and other media have been measured \nat considerable distances from agricultural sources, \nwhich indicates the potential long-range transport in the \natmosphere. For that reason, CPY was listed as toxic air contaminant with potential hazard to human health and \nother living organisms near application sites. In fact, drift \nof CYP onto water surfaces have been documented in \nour country, its effects on vulnerable populations includ -\ning insects, pollinators crustaceans, fish and amphibians \ndepends on frequency, duration and interval between \nexposures.\nThe primary target organ for CPY toxicity in humans is \nthe central nervous system, due to the inhibition of ace -\ntylcholinesterase, but there are evidences that indicate \nits toxicological effects in other tissues. CPY or its me -MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 202168\ntabolite TCP has been found in maternal blood, placenta, \numbilical cord blood and meconium. The environmental \nexposure experienced during the very earliest stages of \nlife, at doses that would not inhibit cholinesterase, pro -\nduced changes in the developing brain architecture and \ndimension associated with lowered IQ at school age. \nStudies performed with embryos, fetus and young ani -\nmals also demonstrate CPY-damage in a wide variety of \nbrain regions, glial cells and neurons. These discover -\nies demonstrate that not only acute and chronic toxicity studies must be performed when determining the safety \nof pesticides but a much larger battery of test including \nfunctional neurological and behavioral end points have \nto be included. The risk associated with the intensive use \nof CPY and other synthetic pesticides require alternative \nsources of chemicals to be used in safe management \nof pests. Plants and their secondary metabolites may be \nexploited as eco-chemical and biorational approach in \nintegrated plant protection programs.\nSIMPOSIO SAIC N\u00b014: WOMEN SCIENTISTS IN EMERGING FIELDS\nChairs: Dra.

Instituto de Bioqu\u00edmica y Medicina Molecular (IBIMOL), \nFacultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica. Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nAir quality is dramatically decreasing worldwide due to \nfaster development of industrialization and increases in \nfossil fuel burning. Humans are continuously and invol -\nuntarily exposed to air pollutants, and considering that \nthere is no safe threshold, adverse health effects occur \nat exposure levels to which most of the urban population \nis currently subjected. Therefore, the concern to estab -\nlish toxicological mechanisms triggered by environmental \nhazards has increasingly gained attention from the public \nhealth perspective. Among the diverse air pollution con -\nstituents, particulate matter (PM) has been pointed out \nas the major component consistently positively correlated \nwith increased morbidity and mortality rates. Since the \nrespiratory system is the entry point for breathable pollut -\nants, not only various chronic respiratory diseases, such \nas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, but \nalso acute illness including pneumonia and allergies are \nmentioned among the most relevant harmful conditions \nfavored by PM exposure. In that sense, air pollution char -acterization in terms of composition and physicochemi -\ncal properties is critical to establish relevant associations \nwith the observed adverse health effects. It is well es -\ntablished that mitochondria represent a key modulator \nof the redox signaling network, in which an interplay is \ndisplayed from the organelle to the rest of the cell. We \nhave focused on the mitochondrial role in altered lung ox -\nidative metabolism associated with an increased reactive \noxygen species production, as well as on the inflamma -\ntory pathways initiated after PM inhalation. Moreover, in \nseveral lung malignancies outcomes both, tissue damage \nand repair mechanisms, are equally important taking into \nconsideration that the disease extension depends on \ntissue remodeling. Hence, it seems important to evalu -\nate and emphasize the discussion of the latest insights \ninto the cellular and molecular toxicological mechanisms \ntriggered in the respiratory system by PM exposure, ad -\ndressing the central role of the alveolar-capillary barrier \nintegrity. Consequently, assessment of PM-initiated oxi -SYMPOSIA69\ndative metabolism and mitochondrial function modulation \nlinked to the alveolar epithelial dynamics involved in tis -\nsue healing mechanisms, emerge as valuable knowledge in the development of adequate therapeutic approaches \naiming to restore the normal alveolar architecture re -\nquired to ensure proper lung function.\nDEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A SCALABLE AND VERSATILE TEST FOR COVID-19 \nDIAGNOSTICS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES\nAlessandro Ceci1, Carmen Mu\u00f1oz-Ballester2, Allison Tegge3, Kathrin L.

However, rural communities, where resourc -\nes for testing are sparse or simply absent, face distinctive \nchallenges to achieving this success. Accordingly, we re -\nport the development of an academic, public land grant \nUniversity laboratory-based detection assay for the iden -\ntification of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from various clinical \nspecimens that can be readily deployed in areas where \naccess to testing is limited. The test, which is a quan -\ntitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction \n(RT-qPCR)-based procedure, was validated on samples \nprovided by the state laboratory and submitted for FDA \nEmergency Use Authorization. Our test exhibits compa -rable sensitivity and exceeds specificity and inclusivity \nvalues compared to other molecular assays. Additionally, \nthis test can be re-configured to meet supply chain short -\nages, modified for scale up demands, and is amenable \nto several clinical specimens. Test development also in -\nvolved 3D engineering critical supplies and formulating a \nstable collection media that allowed samples to be trans -\nported for hours over a dispersed rural region without \nthe need for a cold-chain. These two elements that were \ncritical when shortages impacted testing and when per -\nsonnel needed to reach areas that were geographically \nisolated from the testing center. Overall, using a robust, \neasy-to-adapt methodology, we show that an academ -\nic laboratory can supplement COVID-19 testing needs \nand help local health departments assess and manage \noutbreaks. This additional testing capacity is particularly \ngermane for smaller cities and rural regions that would \notherwise be unable to meet the testing demand.\nHETEROMERIZATION OF G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS: HOW MUCH DOES IT INFLUENCE \nTHEIR BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION?\nMariela M. Gironacci\nDpto. Qca. Biol\u00f3gica, IQUIFIB (UBA-CONICET), Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires\nG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a remarkably \nmultifaceted family of transmembrane proteins that exert a \nvariety of physiological effects. They are targets for around \none third of currently approved and clinical prescribed \ndrugs and represent the largest and most structurally di -\nverse family of transmembrane signaling proteins, with \nalmost 1000 members identified in the human genome. \nAlthough GPCRs are able to operate as monomers, there \nis increasing evidence about the ability of GPCRs to form \nand function as heterodimers/heteromers that exhibit dis -\ntinct pharmacological, trafficking and functional properties \nas compared to their parent monomeric or homodimeric/\nhomomeric GPCRs. Efforts have focused over the past two \ndecades on the identification of GPCR complexes as well \nas on their signaling properties. More recent findings have provided evidence for the existence of GPCR heteromer -\nization in native tissues and animal models. In our lab we \nhave been investigating how the functional properties of \nMas receptor (R), a GPCR with protective actions that be -\nlongs to the renin-angiotensin system, are influenced by \ninteraction with others GPCRs like the bradykinin type 2 \n(B2R) receptor, the dopamine type 2 receptor (D2R) and \nthe MrgDR. MasR-B2R heteromerization influences MasR \npharmacology, signaling and trafficking, while MasR-D2R \nheteromerization is necessary for MasR to display its an -\nti-inflammatory responses. GPCRs heteromerization not \nonly brings forth a plethora of drug target combinations, but \nalso gives an opportunity to carefully tweak the structure \nand function of one or more GPCRs involved in the com -\nplex, with the final goal of improving therapeutic strategies.

It codes for NKX2-5, a transcription factor \nthat regulates the expression of a number of other \ntranscription factors involved in the development and \nfunction of the early heart, among other functions. This \ngene was the first where a single genetic variant (GV) \nwas related to congenital heart disease (CHD).\nOur group recently compiled, curated and structured an \nexhaustive database of all GVs in the gene. In this study, \nwe aimed to expand this information by predicting the \neffect of some GVs in the functionality of the NKX2-5 \nprotein. In order to do that, we proposed a classification \nof all possible missense GVs in the structured region of \nthe protein according to the most probable effect they \nwould have on its functionality.\nWe worked with all the possible amino acid variants \ncaused by a change in a single DNA base pair in the homeodomain (HD) region (n=337). The in silico studies \nincluded an estimation of protein-DNA interaction, protein \nstability, prediction of linear motifs that could be affected \nby the variant and evolutive conservation. Taken together, \nthese results were used to obtain a classification of the \npossible effect of GVs on the functionality of NKX2-5.\nOur analysis determined that 32 GVs may affect the \ninteraction with DNA (9.5%), 10 may have an effect on \nfunctionality due to introducing a cysteine (3.0%), 38 may \naffect a known linear motif (11.3%) and 135 are predicted to \naffect protein stability and/or a putative linear motif (40.0%).\nThis analysis allowed us to estimate the potential effect of \nGVs on NKX2-5. In particular, it contributes to a functional \nprediction of yet unknown GVs, it proposes a mechanism \nfor pathogenesis of known GVs and it helps to better \nunderstand the genotype-phenotype relationship in the \ndevelopment of CHD.\nTHE GALECTIN-1-GLYCAN AXIS PROMOTES DISSEMINATION AND METASTASIS OF BREAST CANCER\nRamiro M.

Here we investigated the role of Gal1 \nin breast cancer metastasis. We found at single cell level \n(scRNAseq) that Gal1 is synthesized by basal cell lineag -\nes and mammary stem cells (SCs) in normal mammary \ngland, where it promotes epithelial branching (**). More -\nover, in the MMTV-NeuHER2/transgenic model, Gal1 \nwas induced in early lesions (EL) compared to primary \ntumors (PT) (RNAseq). Addition of rGal1 to EL 3D-cul -\ntures promoted invasiveness (**) and increased epitheli -\nal-to- mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (RT-PCR). \nThis effect was confirmed in the aggressive Her2+ hu -\nman cell line JIMT-1, which showed high levels of Gal1 (**, Western) and low levels of \u03b12,6 sialyltransferase-1 \n(ST6Gal1), an enzyme that incorporates \u03b12,6-linked sial -\nic acid and blocks Gal1 binding (***, RT-PCR), compared \nwith the HER2+ poorly metastatic cell line BT-\n474. Accordingly, UPLC-HILIC/WAX revealed a \nGal1-permissive glycan signature in JIMT1 (***). Treat -\nment of JIMT-1 cells with rGal1, induced a CD44hi/CD -\n24low cancer stem cell phenotype (***, flow cytometry) \nand enhanced migration (*), mamosphere formation \n(**) and EMT markers (RT-PCR).

Remarkably, these tumors \nupregulated transcripts associated with EMT and down -\nregulated those linked to antitumor immunity (GSEA), as \nvalidated by the immunosuppressive infiltrate (Mixture). \nOur findings highlight the relevance of the Gal1/glycan \naxis in controlling normal mammary gland branching and emphasize its critical  role in metastatic  spreading \nof  breast cancer. We  propose that  the Gal1/ST6Gal1 \npair might serve as a possible biomarker capable of pre -\ndicting the outcome of breast cancer patients and as \na therapeutic target of novel anti-metastatic therapies \n(p<0.05*;p<0.01**;p<0.001***).\nA CRITICAL PATHWAY IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: C19MC MICRORNAS REGULATES FGF2 RE -\nSPONSE IN A MODEL OF HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS CARDIAC DIFFERENTIATION\n Alan Miqueas M\u00f6bbs, Ximena Garate, Maria Agustina Scarafia, Carolina Colli, Natalia Lucia Moro, Carlos Luzzani, \nAriel Waisman, Alejandro La Greca, Santiago Gabriel Miriuka\nLIAN-CONICET, Fleni, Sede Escobar, Ruta 9 Km 52.5. Bel\u00e9n de Escobar. Buenos Aires. Argentina.\nHuman pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) have the capacity \nto self-renew and differentiate in vitro  into all cell types of \nthe organism, and it is an established model for early hu -\nman embryo development. Recently, we found a 56-miR -\nNA-cluster located at human chromosome 19 (C19MC) \nthat downregulates during hPSC cardiac differentiation \n(CD). To ascertain the role of this primate-specific mi -\ncroRNA cluster, a hPSC-C19MC(-/-) line was generated \nwith CRISPR/Cas9. C19MC(-/-) cells displayed no evident \nchanges in the cell cycle, apoptosis or differentiation \nmarkers compared to wild type. Contrarily, C19MC(-/-) \ncells were significantly  impaired to differentiate into car -\ndiomyocytes. Early mesoderm and cardiac RNA mark -\ners, like EOMES, TBX6, MESP1, were found altered. In \norder to further explore the early steps of differentiation, \nwe performed RNA-seq of the cells  at the gastrulation \nstage (0 and 24hs after CHIR99021 incubation). Gene ontology analysis revealed altered signaling pathways, \nincluding PI3K-Akt, MAPK and Wnt, and FGF2. As FGF2 \nis a key pathway in pluripotency, we address its role \nthrough two different approaches. First, both wild type \nand mutant cells were treated with FGF2 for 3 hours be -\nfore gastrulation. Wild-type phenotype was partly recov -\nered, as evidenced by the presence of contractile car -\ndiomyocytes at day 15. Second, given that FGF2 is an \nimportant activator of RAS cascade that phosphorylates \nERK1/2 (pERK), we incubated the cells with FGF2 for up \nto 5 hs in pluripotency media. Mutant cells exhibited an \nelevated pERK mark in ground conditions, and it was no -\nticeable that the phosphorylation took place faster when \nthey were treated. In summary these findings support a \ncritical role of the C19MC microRNA cluster in early stag -\nes of primate differentiation.\nCERAMIDE 1-PHOSPHATE SKEWS HUMAN MACROPHAGES\u00b4 FATE TOWARDS A M2-LIKE PHENOTYPE \nBY RESTRAINING THE M1\nOrtiz Wilczy\u00f1ski JM1, Mena HA2, Olexen CM1, Schattner M1, Negrotto S1, Carrera Silva EA1\n1Laboratorio de Trombosis Experimental,  Instituto de Medicina Experimental, CONICET - Academia Nacional de Medicina. \nBuenos Aires, Argentina. 2Center for Experimental Therapeutics and Reperfusion Injury, Department of Anesthesiology, \nPerioperative and Pain Medicine, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, and Harvard Medical School. Boston, MA, USA.\nCeramide 1-Phosphate (C1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid \nreleased from dying cells after inflammation, increasing \nlocally in the damaged tissue. C1P exerts many bio -\nlogical effects depending on the cell type, including the \ndownregulation of inflammatory mediators and activation \nmarkers. Given that macrophages are critical players for \nboth, resolution of inflammation and tissue restoration, \nhere we aimed to decipher the effect of this sphingolipid \non human monocytes/macrophages (M\u00f8) under inflamed \ntissue conditions and predict the M\u00f8 fate and behavior. \nHuman CD14+ monocytes (Mo) were isolated from PB -\nMCs of healthy donors, cultured with RPMI+10% FBS + \nM-CSF (50ng/ml), and stimulated with C1P short chain \nanalog C8-C1P (1 and/or 20\u00b5M), together with natu -\nrally occurring inflamogens, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and \nhyaluronate (HA); the immune-characterization was \nperformed by flow cytometry and qPCR. Principal Com -\nponent Analysis (PCA) was carried out including all eval -\nuated parameters; for correlation significance, p\u22640.05  was considered. Firstly, C1P-primed Mo (1, 20 or 1+20 \n\u00b5M) gave rise to transcriptionally different M\u00f8 compared \nto the untreated cells. The more explicative dimensions \n(Dim1= 26.2% & Dim2=20.9%) predict that PDGF, MER, \nFGF2, PPARG, LXRA, TGFB1, MMP9, VEGFA, and \nGAS6 are the more contributing variables that segre -\ngate C1P-treated from non-treated cells. In addition, \nwhen Mo were also challenged with LTA and HA and \npolarization markers were considered, CD206+CD163+, \nCD64+CD206/CD163- percentages, CD163, CD206 and \nCD11b MFI and mRNA levels of MER were referred as \nthe main variables explaining 55.6% of total variation \n(Dim1= 36.5% and Dim2 = 19.1%). These findings high -\nlight that monocytes primed with a high concentration of \nC1P, and under inflamed tissue conditions would skew \nmacrophages to a pro-resolving program over the inflam -\nmatory license. Integrating, C1P is a key messenger also \nin macrophages to promote pro-inflammatory deactiva -\ntion and tissue regeneration.MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Astrocyte pathological conversion \nwith a pro-inflammatory gain of function involves dramat -\nic and stable transcriptomic changes, probably following \nactivation of transcription factor NF-kB. NF-kB interacts \nwith chromatin remodelling enzymes and recruits them to \nregulatory regions of target genes promoting epigenetic \nchanges in other cell types.\nWe aim to address the epigenetic mechanisms that are \nassociated with NF-kB activation in reactive astrocytes \nthat might lead to the establishment of an astrocyte \npathological identity.  \nUsing immunofluorescence microscopy and PCR analy -\nsis in primary cultures of mouse cortical astrocytes with \ndifferent microglia abundance and exposed to pro-in -\nflammatory stimulus LPS (Lipopolysaccharide), we ob -\nserved that LPS significantly promoted: 1) Sequential NF-kB activation in microglia>>astrocytes together with \nmorphological and transcriptional changes, 2) A variable \nintensity of initial NF-kB activation in astrocytes depend -\ning on microglial abundance and the release of microglial \nsoluble factors and 3) A microglial-dependent increase in \ngene activating histone marks H3K9K14ac and H3K27ac \nand a decrease in the repressive mark H3K9me3. In vivo  \nbrain ischemia recapitulated the increase in H3K27ac \nspecifically in reactive astrocytes from ischemic penum -\nbra and inhibition of histone deacetylases exacerbated \nastrogliosis and brain damage.\nOur results showing changes in histone mark abundance \nare highly indicative of chromatin remodeling events in \na subpopulation of pro-inflammatory reactive astrocytes. \nSuch epigenetic mechanisms may represent plausible \ntherapeutic targets to reduce astrocyte pro-inflammatory \nphenotype, neuroinflammation and neuronal loss after \nbrain injury.\nGrants: UBACYT, FONCYT, ISN-CAEN, APBIOTECH\nCROSSTALK BETWEEN ANGIOGENESIS AND IMMUNE MODULATION: HYPOXIA AS A DRIVER \nOF THE DIFFERENTIATION OF EXHAUSTED CD8 T CELLS. \nDiego O Croci\nLaboratorio de Glicobiolog\u00eda y Biolog\u00eda Vascular, Instituto de Histolog\u00eda y Embriolog\u00eda de Mendoza (IHEM), \nConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Mendoza, Argentina.\nHypoxia, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression  are inter -\nrelated events that fuel tumor progression  and blunt clin-\nical effectiveness of therapies. During my scientific ca-\nreer, I focused on glycans and glycan-binding proteins \nas key players in neovascularization and immune re -\nsponses in cancer, inflammation, and immunity.\nSince 2016, I became the head of the \u201cGlycobiology \nand Vascular Biology\u201d laboratory at the IHEM-CON -\nICET, were we explore several physio-pathological set -\ntings converging on the cellular and molecular mecha -\nnisms that link hypoxia, neovascularization, and immune \nresponses. In this sense, we are particularly interested in \ngenerating relevant systems to study in vitro hypoxic-me -\ndiated neovascularization and to generate novel molecu -\nlar diagnostic tools for clinical applications.\nOur main areas of research include: 1) The glycome re -\nmodeling in virally mediated tumorigenesis in the context \nof KSHV and HIV co-infection in Kaposi Sarcoma. 2) The \neffect of hypoxia in inflammation-induced angiogene -sis, and the dynamic regulation of intestinal glycome in \ninflammatory diseases. In this scenario, we also study \nmiRNA expression as mediators of hypoxia-driven epi -\nthelial cell glycosylation. \nFinally, in an attempt to reconcile seemingly opposite \nevidence concerning the impact of hypoxia on function -\nal features of exhausted CD8 T cells, we investigate \nthe fine-tuning of CD8 T cell exhaustion by hypoxia and \nits association with angiogenesis in the tumor microenvi -\nronment. In this sense, we found that both hypoxia and \nVEGF promote the differentiation of PD-1+TIM-3+CX -\nCR5+ terminally exhausted CD8 T cells at the expense \nof PD-1+TIM-3- progenitor subsets. Moreover, hypox -\nia accentuated a proangiogenic profile in exhausted \nCD8 T cells, MDSCs, and hMSCs cells. Altogether, our \nfindings highlight the reciprocal regulation between hy -\npoxia, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression, providing \na rational basis to optimize synergistic combinations of \nantiangiogenic and immunotherapeutic AWARDS73\nIMPACT OF PLACENTAL ZIKA VIRUS INFECTION DURING EARLY PREGNANCY: \nEFFECT ON TROPHOBLAST FUNCTION, METABOLISM AND IMMUNE-TROPHOBLAST INTERACTION. \nPOTENTIAL ANTIVIRAL EFFECT OF VIP\nDaiana Marina Vota\nLaboratorio de Inmunofarmacolog\u00eda. Instituto de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica de la Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (IQUIBICEN), \nCONICET-Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina\nObjective: Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy \nis associated to fetal growth impairment and altered cen -\ntral nervous system development. Up to date, there is no \ntreatment or vaccines to ameliorate fetal growth defects. \nWe previously demonstrated that the vasoactive intesti -\nnal peptide (VIP) modulates trophoblast cell (Tb) function \nand metabolism at early pregnancy. Our aim is to deter -\nmine the metabolism and signaling pathways altered by \nZIKV in first-trimester human Tb cells, the impact on the \nTb-immune cell interaction and the potential antiviral ef -\nfect of VIP. Material and Methods: First-trimester Tb-de -\nrived cell line Swan-71 was infected with an isolated local \nZIKV strain with/without VIP. Tb migration was assessed \nin wound healing assays and RNA expression by RT- \nqPCR. PBMC from healthy volunteers were conditioned \nwith media (CM) from Tb-infected cells to analyze migra -\ntion and functional profile. Results: ZIKV impaired Tb mi -\ngration and decreased the expression of the neurotroph -ic factor BDNF. CM of Tb infected cells increased the \nrecruitment of monocytes, CD4+ and NK cells and modi -\nfied the activation profile of CD14+ cells favoring immune \nhomeostasis maintenance. ZIKV infection increased Tb \nglucose uptake and modulated the signaling pathway of \nretinol inducing RIG-1 and RAR-alpha expression while \na decrease of RAR-beta was detected. Interestingly, Tb \ncells infected in the presence of VIP produced lower in -\nfectious viral particles (p<0.01) along with a decrease of \nviral RNA in Tb cells. Moreover, VIP ameliorated ZIKV \neffect on Tb migration (p<0.05). Conclusion: Zika viral \ninfection might impact early pregnancy by affecting Tb \nfunction, altering Tb metabolism and modulating Tb-leu -\nkocyte interaction thus sustaining Tb survival and virus \npersistence in the placenta. VIP emerges as a potential \nantiviral candidate to reduce the impact of ZIKV placen -\ntal infection at early pregnancy since it decreases ZIKV \npropagation and restores Tb cell migration.\nOPTIMIZING THE EFFICACY OF CURRENT THERAPIES AND DEVELOPING NEW STRATEGIES \nFOR ADVANCED LUNG CANCER\nMariana Malvicini\nCancer Immunobiology Laboratory- Instituto de Investigaciones en Medicina Traslacional (IIMT) Universidad Austral- CONICET\nTumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex mix of can -\ncer cells, soluble factors, endothelial cells, tumor-asso -\nciated macrophages, immune cells, cancer-associated \nfibroblasts, and cancer stem cells (CSCs) surrounded by \nthe extracellular matrix (ECM). Components of the TME \ninteract with tumor cells in order to prolong and maintain \ncancer progression. Interestingly, a suppressive tumor \nmicroenvironment has been identified as one of the main \nmechanisms of resistance to therapies, including immune \nand chemotherapy. One of the current clinical challeng -\nes is to develop therapeutic approaches that effectively \nmodulate this TME by combining agents to achieve op -\ntimal responses to treatments.  We have shown that the \nadministration of coumarin 4-methylumbilliferone (4Mu) \nmodulates the phenotype of CSCs, a small subpopula -\ntion of cells with the capacity to self-renew and sustain \ntumor growth. 4Mu is capable of selectively reducing \nCD47 expression in these cells, eliciting their phagocy -tosis by antigen-presenting cells, increasing specific an -\ntitumor immunity and potentiate the efficacy of immuno -\ntherapy against hepatocellular carcinoma. For advanced \nlung cancer, immunotherapy alone or combined with \nchemotherapy has changed the course of patients with \nmetastatic disease and its usefulness is being studied in \nthe context of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy. How -\never, it has been reported that there is a 60% of primary \nresistance to treatments. In this context, we study, on \nthe one hand, the mechanisms involved in the efficacy \nor lack of response to these therapies and, on the other, \nthe possibility of introducing new developments. We pro -\npose improve the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy \nby reversal of the resistance of CSCs involved in recur -\nrence or lack of sensitivity to platinum-taxane therapy us -\ning 4Mu and also the use of glucose-functionalized gold \nnanoparticles (spheres, cylinders and stars) to induce \nphotothermal damage in tumor cells.MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

The aim of this \nstudy was to evaluate the effects of hemin treatment (an \nHO-1 inducer) on liver damage induced by SRD and \nidentify the underlying mechanisms.\nSRD-treated rats are presented with IR, hepatic ste -\natosis, and high serum levels of NEFAS, glycemia, and \ntriacylglycerides (TAG). Administration of hemin for the \nlast two weeks of the dietary intervention (15 mg/kg/48h, \nSRD+H) did not modify these parameters, except for the \nobserved reduction in serum TAG levels. A lower de -\ngree of ballooning (histological change compatible with \ninjury) as well as a decrease in oxidative stress param -\neters (TBARS and 3-nitrotyrosine levels, SOD and cat -alase activities), UPR (expression of XBP1s, ATF4 and \nGRP78) and apoptosis (TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 \nexpression) were also detected in SRD-treated rats. The \ninduction of HO-1 expression in KC by hemin was asso -\nciated with lower tissue levels of IL1 b, TNFa and pP65 \ncompared to the SRD group. Induction of PEPCK as well \nas the response to pyruvate were blocked by hemin, that \nalso restored the ratio pAkt/Akt altered by SRD. Finally, \nanimals in the SRD+H group showed an increase in the \nexpression of PPAR a, CPT1a and ACOX1 a (proteins \ninvolved in lipid oxidation), and an increase in pAMPK \n(vs. SRD). In summary, our results lead us to hypothe -\nsize that administration of hemin attenuates liver injury \ninduced by sucrose diet by reducing the pro-inflamma -\ntory tone of the KC associated with the induction of HO-\n1. Moreover, hemin treatment is also able to decrease \nTAG serum levels by increasing lipid oxidation through \nthe stimulation of the AMPK/PPAR a pathway in the liver.\nSAIC \u2013 FARYNA \u2013 RAVEGLIA AWARD\nJuries: Dra.

Here, we sought \nto identify key metabolic genes that fuel prostate cancer \n(PCa) bone metastasis. By an indirect transwell co-culture \nsystem of PCa (PC3) and bone progenitor cells (MC3T3 or \nRaw264.7) we assessed the transcriptomic profile of PC3 \ncells modulated by soluble factors released from bone pre -\ncursors. Strong activation of lipid metabolic pathways includ -\ning PPAR and PI3K-Akt (P<0.05) was observed in PC3 cells. \nNext, we selected the altered metabolic genes for an unsu -\npervised clustering analysis using transcriptomic data from \nhuman PCa and bone metastasic samples (GSE74685). In -\nterestingly, those genes could cluster PCa patients in two de -\nfined groups: primary PCa and bone metastasis, highlighting \nthat the early transcriptional metabolic alterations triggered \nin our co-culture model could discriminate primary tumors from bone metastatic samples. Further, the expression lev -\nels of four lipid associated genes ( VDR, PPARA , SLC16A1  \nand GPX1 ) could be independent risk-predictors of death \n(HR: 4.96, 2.85, 3.93 and 3.67, respectively; P<0.05), and \nthat the combined expression of these four genes correlates \nwith a worst outcome in metastatic patients (HR: 2.65, \nP<0.05) (SU2C-PCF data set). Further, we identified PKA \nas a master regulator of this lipid-associated signature (Inge -\nnuity Pathway Analysis). Secretome analysis (ESI MS/MS) \nof conditioned media from these co-cultures revealed critical \nsoluble factors secreted by bone progenitors (Col1a2, Fn1 \nand Cacna2d1) which could regulate PKA activity to promote \nthe metabolic rewiring of PCa cells. Overall, we identified a \nnovel lipid gene signature triggered during the communica -\ntion between PCa and bone cells that appears to be critical \nfor survival in PCa patients, pointing out to new attractive \ndruggable targets for the disease.AWARDS75\nGLYCOSYLATION-DEPENDENT CIRCUITS SYNCHRONIZE THE PRO-ANGIOGENIC AND IMMUNOREG -\nULATORY FUNCTIONS OF MYELOID-DERIVED SUPPRESSOR CELLS IN CANCER\nAda G.

To elucidate \nthe mechanisms that synchronize these functions, we in -\nvestigated the role of glycosylation-dependent, galectin-1 \n(Gal1)-driven circuits in coupling immunoregulatory and \npro-angiogenic activities of MDSCs. Flow cytometry and \nHPLC-HILIC/WAX revealed an activation-dependent glycan \nprofile in monocytic and polymorphonuclear MDSCs (p=0.03) \nthat controlled Gal1 binding and was more prominent in tu -\nmor microenvironments. Exposure to Gal1 led to concom -\nitant activation of immunosuppression and angiogenesis \nprograms in bone marrow derived MDSCs. Flow cytometry \nof Gal1-conditioned MDSCs showed higher expression of \nimmune checkpoint molecules, including programmed death \nligand-1 (PD-L1) (p=0.005) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygen -\nase (IDO) (p=0.037) and greater production of reactive ox -\nygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) (p=0.02) . In vitro, Gal1-conditioned MDSCs showed greater T-cell suppres -\nsive capacity (p=0.03) and higher IL-10 (p=0.04) and IL-27 \n(p=0.003) secretion. These effects were accompanied by en -\nhanced endothelial cell migration, tube formation, 3D-sprout -\ning and vascularization (p<0.05). In vivo , Gal1-conditioned \nMDSCs accelerated tumor growth (p=0.001) and fostered \nimmune evasion and vascularization programs in Gal1-defi -\ncient colorectal tumors. Mechanistically, mass spectrometry, \nimmunoblot and blocking assays identified the CD18/CD11b/\nCD177 complex as a bona fide Gal1 receptor and STAT3 as \na key signaling pathway coupling these functions. Accord -\ningly, a combined algorithm that integrates Gal1 expression \nand MDSC phenotype, showed critical prognostic value by \ndelineating the immune landscape and clinical outcome of \nhuman cancers. Thus, glycosylation-dependent Gal1-driven \ncircuits favor tumor progression by coupling immunoregula -\ntory and pro-angiogenic programs of MDSCs via CD18- and \nSTAT3-dependent pathways.\nTRANSCRIPTOMIC STUDY REVEALS GENES AND BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH \nCLINICAL EVOLUTION OF PATIENTS WITH CHILDHOOD ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA\nMercedes Abbate1,2, Mar\u00eda Sol Ruiz1,2, Mar\u00eda Cecilia Riccheri3, Geraldine Gueron1,2, Elba Vazquez1,2, Javier Cotignola1,2\n1 Universidad de Buenos Aires, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica, Buenos Aires, \nArgentina, 2CONICET - Universidad de Buenos Aires, Instituto de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica de la Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y \nNaturales (IQUIBICEN), Buenos Aires, Argentina, 3Hospital Nacional Posadas, El Palomar, Buenos Aires, Argentina. \nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most incident \npediatric cancer. While considerable progress has been \nmade on treatment efficacy and survival rates, about 15-\n30% of patients relapse and/or die. We aimed to identify \ngene-expression profiles in childhood ALL that could help \nbetter predict disease outcome, response to treatment \nand therapy-related toxicity. We collected 39 bone marrow \nsamples at time of diagnosis of ALL from 3 hospitals from \nArgentina. Total RNA was isolated to perform transcriptome \nanalysis (RNAseq). Clinico-pathological characteristics and \ndisease outcome were evaluated and recorded by onco -\nhematologists. We analyzed differential gene expression \n(DGE) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) comparing: \nearly response to prednisone, event-free survival, risks \ngroup, acute toxicity and minimal residual disease at day \n15. We observed that about 30% of dysregulated genes \nwere non-coding RNAs, being long non-coding RNA (ln -\ncRNA) the predominant biotype. We identified 6 differen -tially expressed pathways relevant to ALL biology (p<0.01) \nand 7 lncRNAs (MIR99AHG, LINC02866, ZNF385D-AS2, \nLINC02848, MYO18B-AS1, Lnc-PPDPFL-1, Lnc-RIT2-2; \npadj\u22640.05) among ALL risk groups. Because the biologi -\ncal activity of most lncRNAs is still unknown and under the \nhypothesis that lncRNAs modulate biochemical pathways, \nwe calculated the correlation between significant lncRNA \nand pathway expressions. We found that MYO18B-AS1 \npositively correlated with \u201cinactivation of MAPKK activity\u201d \n(r=0.4;p=0.02) and LINC02866 negatively correlated with \n\u201cCXCR3 chemokine receptor binding\u201d (r=-0.4;p=0.02) and \n\u201ctransmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase \nactivity\u201d (r=-0.4;p=0.01). This study identified dysregulated \nlncRNAs and biochemical pathways that might be relevant \nin the pathology of childhood ALL.  The analysis of these \ngene-expression profiles at diagnosis might help improving \nrisk stratification, therapy efficacy and reducing the occur -\nrence of relapse and toxicity.

The virus can infect cells through the \ninteraction of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its S \nprotein with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) \nreceptor. Consequently, the S protein has become the \nprincipal target for therapeutic interventions. Llama-de -\nrived single domain antibodies or Nanobodies (Nbs) are \nsmall molecules with extraordinary affinity for different \ntargets that can be produced at low cost. In this work we \npresent results showing the neutralizing capacity of Nbs \ndirected against the S protein, both in vitro and in vivo .\nA llama was immunized with the pre-fusion and locked \nS and RBD proteins expressed in HEK-293T cells. Once \nhigh antibody titers were obtained, an Nb library was generated. More than 80 Nbs clones against S and RBD \nproteins were selected by phage display, 52 of them with \nunique sequences were expressed in Escherichia coli  \nWK6 and purified by immobilized metal chelate chroma -\ntography, followed by size exclusion chromatography. \nTen of those Nbs were able to prevent the transduction of \npseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein as well \nas the infection of Vero cells with the wild-type SARS-\nCoV-2 virus strains circulating both in Argentina and in \nthe United States of America. Preliminary results have \nshown that at least 3 of those Nbs are capable of neutral -\nizing the SARS-CoV-2 isolate USAWA1/2020 in a mouse \nmodel, with protection ranging from 60 to 80% after a \nlethal challenge.\nIn conclusion, we have selected several Nbs capable of \nneutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The strong neutraliz -\ning activity of some of these molecules makes them po -\ntential candidates for intranasal treatment of COVID-19.\nANTIANDROGENS POSE A PROTECTIVE EFFECT AGAINST COVID-19 BY BOOSTING THE HUMAN \nMYXOVIRUS RESISTANCE GENE 1 (MX1)\nJuan Bizzotto1-2, Pablo Sanchis1-2, Rosario Lavignolle1-2, Sofia Lage-Vickers1-2, Agustina Sabater1-2, Mercedes Abbate1-2, \nAyelen Toro1-2, Nicolas Anselmino3, Estefania Labanca3, Nora Navone3, Elba Vazquez1-2, Javier Cotignola1-2, \nGeraldine Gueron1-2.\n1 Universidad de Buenos Aires, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica, Buenos Aires \nC1428EGA, Argentina;\n2 CONICET - Universidad de Buenos Aires, Instituto de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica de la Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales \n(IQUIBICEN), Buenos Aires C1428EGA, Argentina\n3 Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology and the David H. Koch Center for Applied\nResearch of Genitourinary Cancers, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.\nPopulation-based studies have shown that prostate \ncancer (PCa) patients undergoing androgen-depri -\nvation therapies (ADT) were partially protected from \nCOVID-19. Men treated with proxalutamide in a recent \nclinical trial, showed reduced COVID-19 hospitalization \nrate. In this work we assessed gene expression profiles \nand androgen regulation of the main host cell receptors \ndescribed for SARS-CoV-2 and potential antiviral genes involved in response to coronavirus infection.\nMultiple bioinformatics analyses were performed to study \nhost cell receptors and antiviral proteins in SARS-CoV-2 in -\nfection and the gene expression changes upon ADT was as -\nsessed. We used publicly available datasets from: a) SARS-\nCoV-2 positive and negative patients\u2019 nasopharyngeal \nswabs at time of diagnosis (GSE152075, n=453), b) SARS-\nCoV-2 infected human cell lines and ferrets (GSE1407507), AWARDS77\nc) ChIP-seq experiments evaluating androgen receptor \nbinding (GSE66037, GSE28950, GSE108704).\nResults showed that SARS-CoV-2 positive cases had \nhigher MX1 expression, and multivariable regression \nshowed that MX1 expression  significantly increased with \nviral load. Also, MX1 was significantly up-regulated in \ntracheal samples from ferrets intranasally infected with \nSARS-CoV-2. Similar results were found in A549 and \nCalu3 lung cell lines. Since ADT might result in a thera -\npeutic advantage against COVID-19, we next evaluated \nMX1 regulation by dihydrotestosterone (DHT). First, com -parable MX1 levels in lung, prostate and salivary gland \nof healthy humans were observed (GTEx). LNCaP cells \ntreated with DHT showed a decrease (p<0.05) in MX1 \nmRNA levels. ChIP-seq experiments showcased AR \nbinding sites on the MX1 sequence upon DHT. Further, \ncomparison of paired PCa patient\u2019s samples before and \nafter ADT showed MX1 upregulation (p<0.05) after ADT.\nIn summary, MX1 raises as a critical responder in SARS-\nCoV-2 infection and we demonstrate MX1 modulation by \nDHT. We propose MX1 as a key player in the therapeutic \nadvantage posed by ADT. \nTHE OTHER SIDE OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC: EFFECTS ON FEMALE FERTILITY\nYamila Herrero1, Natalia Pascuali1, Candela Vel\u00e1zquez1, Gonzalo Oubi\u00f1a1, Vanesa Hauk2, Ignacio de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga3, Mariana \nG\u00f3mez Pe\u00f1a3, Gustavo Mart\u00ednez4, Mariano Lavolpe5, Florencia Veiga6, Fernando Neuspiller6, Dalhia Abramovich1, \nLeopoldina Scotti1,7and Fernanda Parborell1.\n1 Laboratorio de estudios de la Fisiopatolog\u00eda del Ovario.

In the human ovary, ACE-\n2 is expressed in stromal and granulosa cells. \nOur objective was to evaluate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 in -\nfection on female gonad. \nFF (follicular fluid) from patients undergoing ART (n= 80; \n21\u201341 years old; November 2020-April 2021) were divided in \ntwo groups: FF from control patients and FF from recovered \nCOVID-19 patients (asymptomatic and with mild symptoms). \nThe levels of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-\n10 and VEGF were measured in FF by ELISA. \nUsing a granulosa cell line (COV434) and an endothelial cell \nline (EA.hy926), we studied the effect of FF from control and \nrecovered COVID-19 patients. The expression of StAR, ER\u03b1 \nand ER\u03b2, 3\u03b2-HSD, VEGF, ANGPTs (angiogenesis-related \nproteins) and \u03b3H2AX (DNA damage marker) was evaluated \nby WB. Proliferation was evaluated by a WST-1 assay. En -\ndothelial cell migration was evaluated by a wound healing \nassay. We performed Student\u2019s t test or one-way ANOVA.\nThe results showed that 91.3% of post-COVID-19 FF was \npositive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Patients with higher \nlevels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG showed a decrease in the number of retrieved oocytes  (p<0.05) . The levels of VEGF and IL-1\u03b2 \nwere lower (p<0.05) in post-COVID-19 FF, while IL-10 did \nnot differ.\nIn COV434 cells with post-COVID-19 FF, the expression of \nStAR, Er\u03b2 and VEGF was decreased (p<0.05), while ER\u03b1 \nand 3\u03b2-HSD did not change.\nIn EA.hy926 cells with post-COVID-19 FF, a decrease in \ncell migration was observed (p<0.0001) without changes in \nthe expression of ANGPTs. Both cell types showed higher \nexpression of \u03b3H2AX with post-COVID-19 FF (p<0.05). No \ndifferences were found in COV434 and EA.hy926 cell prolif -\neration rates between the groups.\nIn conclusion, these results describe that SARS-CoV-2 infec -\ntion alters the follicular microenvironment, damaging ovarian \nfunction, and affecting reproductive performance in recov -\nered COVID-19 patients. \nThis project that involves the use of human samples from \nassisted fertilization techniques has been approved by the \nIByME Ethics Committee in 2020 (REGISTRATION CODE \n2850, October 2020).\nThis project was carried out between January and June \n2021 .\nSAIC \u2013 REPETTO AWARD\nJuries: Dr. Eduardo Cuestas, Dra.

No con -tractility damage was found in 25/28 patients evaluated \nby STE.\nBenznidazole was prescribed in 87 patients and nifurti -\nmox in 8 patients. Baseline parasitemia data was avail -\nable for 65/95 patients. During follow-up, 59/61 (96%) \ntreated patients achieved constant negative parasitemia \nevaluated by qPCR. A decrease in T.cruzi antibodies ti -\nters was observed and seroconversion occurred in 53/95 \n(56%) treated patients. These results showed a good ef -\nficacy of treatment in parasite clearance.\nConclusions: A good treatment response with a low in -\ncidence of cardiological lesions related to CD was ob -\nserved. This suggests a protective effect of parasiticidal \ntreatment on the development of cardiological lesions \nand highlights the importance of early treatment of in -\nfected children.ABSTRACTS79\nAGENTES ANTIMICROBIANOS Y ANTIPARASITARIOS\n1.

Vascular \ncatheter-related infection is its main source. Gram-positive bacteria \nspecially Staphylococcus spp., are the most prevalent etiological \nagents. Bacterial adherence is the starting point of colonization of a \nsurface known as biofilm development. The inhibition of this process \nis the primary strategy to prevent bacteremia related to medical de -\nvices. The aim of this work was to assess the inhibitory activity of the \nantimicrobial peptide AP7121 on the Staphylococcus aureus  adher -\nence in vascular catheters. The biofilm-producer strain Staphylococ -\ncus aureus  ATCC 35556 (SA) was used. First, The MIC of AP7121 \n(MICAP) for SA was estimated. Upon, 20 mm segments of vascular \ncatheter (n=3) were inoculated with 104 CFU/mL of SA. Three differ -\nent treatment schemes (A: simultaneous, B: previous and C: follow -\ning bacterial challenge) using 1 x MICAP were tested. Control groups \nwere included in each scheme. Statistical analysis was made using \nANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test ( p <0.05 was considered statistically \nsignificant). The MICAP was 0.48 mg/L. A significant bacterial reduc -\ntion ( p < 0.001) of 2 logarithms representing a decrease of 99% of \nviable SA cells was achieved with schemes A and B. The post-chal -\nlenge treatment with AP7121 (scheme C) produced a significant \nreduction ( p < 0.01) of 1 logarithm representing a decrease of 90% \nof viable SA cells. The results observed in this work suggest a fast \nantimicrobial activity of AP7121 that could be beneficial to reduce \nbacterial adherence on medical devices such as vascular catheter \nand potential decreasing bloodstream infections -associated. In vivo  \nstudies are needed to establish the feasibility of this proposal.\n  \n2.

Here, we demonstrated that Met mediated \nthe dephosphorylation of Eg-TOR in Ser3122, which trigger the reduc -\ntion of its activity in metacestodes, responding also to exogenous \ninsulin and rapamycin. Moreover, Met induced the overexpression \nof TFEB, a hub transcription factor that regulates lysosome biogene -\nsis, lipid catabolism and autophagy in metazoa. In concordance with \nthe mitochondrial depolarization induced by Met, an increase in total \ncellular Pi (an activator of PFK1) was detected, with stimulation of \nglycogen consumption (glycogenolysis) and, increase of glycolysis \nand the lactate fraction. Cumulatively, this supports the reduction \nin the glucose intracystic content demonstrated in vitro , as well as \nin two different experiments (50 and 250 mg/kg/day of Met) in the \nechinococcosis murine model. In this line of evidence, the energy \nstarvation induced by Met causes endoplasmic reticulum stress-me -\ndiated unfolded protein response (UPR). In presence of a man -\nnose-specific lectin (Helja-FITC) and using confocal microscopy, we \nfound that parasite cells expanded their ER volume at least 3-fold \nunder treatment with Met. Using thapsigargin, tunicamycin and \nMet-treated parasites, we validated the IRE activity by XBP1 splic -\ning and demonstrated that Met induced the mRNA of Bip/Grp78d. \nIn this context, we described that UPR induced after Met-treatment \ncan take place upon glucose deprivation in the parasite, suggesting \nthat the anthelminthic effects of Met result from sustained autophagy \nmediated by activation of the AMPK-TOR-TFEB signaling pathway \ninterdependent with UPR activation, especially through the IRE/XBP \narm.\n3.

This work aimed to investigate the \nrole of the phosphomannans in mediating the fungicidal action of \nHelja. We have used a C. albicans  glycosylation defective in cell \nwall phosphomannosylation (mnn4null), which is correlated with a \nconcomitant reduction in the surface negative charge, to compare \nthe antifungal effect of Helja relative to the wild type strain (wt). \nYeast cells of both strains were incubated in the presence of Helja \nto follow optical reading at 630 nm and assess fungal growth. Helja \ninhibited mutant and wt fungal growth in 70% and 25% respectively. \nMicroscopic analysis of the mutant yeast treated with Helja revealed \nthe loss of cell viability and differentials morphological alterations \ncompared to wt, such as loss of the typical oval yeast form, forma -\ntion of clusters with agglutinated cells and vacuolar collapse. These \nresults suggest that Helja could establish stronger interactions with \nthe cell wall of the mnn4null mutants than with the wt strains, in \nwhich the presence of a greater amount of surface negative charge \nwould display a repulsion effect with the anionic lectin (PI 4.65). In \nconclusion, our results provide new evidence on the nature of the \nmolecular interactions of Helja with the outer mannoproteins and its \nimpact on the antifungal activity, highlighting the relevance to elu -\ncidate the mode of action of new natural compounds for effective \nantifungal therapies design.\n5.

It does not heal spontaneously, and after pro -\nlonged and painful treatments the disease can evolve into a disfigur -\ning and disabling form. The present work aims to obtain a liposomal \nformulation for topical application for photodynamic therapy (PDT) \nagainst CL. The formulation will allow the transport of methylene \nblue to the viable epidermis where the infected cells are located, to \nthen activate it with light in such a way as to produce site-specific \ntoxicity.\nUltradeformable liposomes, composed of soy phosphatidylcholine \nand sodium cholate, loaded with methylene blue, were obtained by \nmeans of traditional methods. The suspension was characterized \nphysicochemically by dynamic light scattering and zeta potential. \nEncapsulation efficiency, drug-lipid ratio, and oxygen consumption \nas an indicator of ROS production after photoactivation were also \ndetermined. The cytotoxicity, both intrinsic and after photoactivation, \nof different concentrations of the formulation was determined by \nMTT in the cell line HaCaT. The photoactivation was carried out with a red LED light source emitting around \u03bb = 600 nm.\nIn the future, the non-cytotoxic concentrations after photoactivation \nwill be employed to assess the antiparasitic activity against promas -\ntigotes of L. braziliensis.  \nIn conclusion, it is expected to contribute with alternatives therapies \nagainst this neglected disease.\n6.

The \nmain advantage of PDI is its effectiveness in bacterial strains resis -\ntant to antibiotics.The 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a precursor in \nendogenous biosynthesis of porphyrins, some of which have photo -\nsensitizingactivity.\nThe aim of this work was to employ ALA-based PDI to eliminate \nplanktonic and biofilms cultures of five methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) \nand six -resistant (MRSA) S. aureus  strains.\nBacterial viability and porphyrin production were evaluated through \ncolony count and fluorescence spectroscopy, respectively. PDI light \nsource was an array of Tungsten lamps (90J/cm2). \nViability of  S. aureus planktonic cultures was reduced around 1-log \nafter ALA-PDI treatment with 1 mM ALA. As a strategy to increase \nthe outcome of PDI, a more lipophilic derivative of ALA, the hexyl \nester ALA (H-ALA), was used.  H-ALA (0.5 mM) induced bacterial \nviability reduction up to 4-logs in all strains tested. \nThe biofilms of RN6390 (MSSA) and ST5-SCCmecI (MRSA, fre -\nquently involved in nosocomial infections) were less sensitive to PDI \nthan their planktonic counterparts. In both strains, it was necessary \nto perform PDI with 2 mM ALA or H-ALA to reduce biofilms viability \nby 0.5 and 0.75 logs, respectively.\nTo improve the effects of PDI on biofilms, we proposed a near-in -\nfrared laser treatment (NIRT) prior to performing PDI. NIRT thermal \neffects are capable ofinducing changes on biofilm structure. By this \nstrategy, the viability of RN6390 and ST5-SCCmecI biofilms was \nreduced by 3 and 4-logs, respectively. NIRT induced increase in \nporphyrin synthesis from ALA or H-ALA as well as detachment of \nbacteria.\nWe conclude that PDI is a promising alternative to eliminate MRSA \nstrains of sanitary relevance. In addition, we verified the synergistic \neffect of two radiation-based bactericidal strategies.\n7.

Repeated or prolonged treatments are  usually \nrequired that entail a higher probability of adverse effects. Meben -ABSTRACTS81\ndazole ( MBZ ), a low-cost, broad-spectrum benzimidazole widely \nused against intestinal parasites, is insoluble and poorly absorbed, \nwhich could be related to variable clinical results. Two novel MBZ \nformulations were designed to improve its solubility and absorption \nrate, a nanoparticulate system ( Np) and an inclusion complex with \n\u03b2-cyclodextrin citrate ( Comp ). This research aimed to evaluate the \nin vivo  anthelmintic activity of the systems compared with pure MBZ, \nagainst the encysted parasite, in the parenteral phase of infection. \nAdult mice of both sexes of the susceptible CBi+ line (CBi-IGE stock) \nwere orally infected with 2 Ts L1 infective larvae/g bw (n=6 per treat -\nment, per sex). Animals were non-treated (controls, C) or treated \nwith a daily oral dose of MBZ , Np, or Comp  (15 mg MBZ/kg bw) \non days 27, 28, and 29 post-infection. Mice were euthanized seven \ndays after the last dose to estimate larval muscle load (number of \nL1 larvae/g fresh tissue, rLL) and larvae reduction rate (LRr, %). No \nsignificant differences were observed between males and females \nin any of the groups. MBZ  did not show an effective antiparasitic ac -\ntivity since rLL of mice treated with the pure drug did not differ from \nthe controls (mean\u00b1SEM, C: 891\u00b1118.0; MBZ : 1107\u00b1155.3). The \nformulations produced a significant decrease in the parasite load \n(Np: 97\u00b125.3; Comp : 69\u00b19.5), compared with that of the controls \n(P<0.002) or the MBZ-treated group (P<0.0004). Accordingly, LRr \nwas 0 % for MBZ , 82 % for Np, and 91 % for Comp -treated mice. \nThe therapeutic efficacy achieved by the formulations suggests that \nboth preparations would allow the use of lower doses of the anti -\nparasitic, thus reducing the possible toxic effects of the treatment.\n8.

Available anti-parasitic treatment against CE \nis mostly limited to the use of benzimidazoles, mainly albendazole \n(ABZ). However, it has undesirable side effects and their efficacy is \nabout 50%. Based on the problematic described, new treatment al -\nternatives are urgently needed. Plants from the Stevia  genus (As -\nteraceae) are a potential source of anti-protozoal and anti-microbial \ncompounds. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the  in \nvitro and in vivo  efficacy of the  Stevia aristata  dichloromethane ex -\ntract against E. granulosus. Viable and free protoscoleces or cysts \nwere treated with 100, 50, 10 and 5 \u03bcg/ml of the extract. Viability \nassessment using the methylene blue exclusion test and scanning \nelectron microscopy (SEM) (for protoscoleces) or evaluation of ger -\nminal layer collapse (for cysts) was performed. CF-1 mice (n=30) \ninfected with  E. granulosus  were allocated into the following exper -\nimental groups (6 months post-infection): (1) Control, (2) ABZ 25 \nmg/kg, every 24 h for 30 days; (3) S. aristata  50 mg/kg, every 24 h \nfor 23 days. At the end of the treatment the weight of the cysts was \nrecorded and samples were analysed by SEM. Protoscoleces via -\nbility decreased quickly with 100 \u00b5g/ml, reaching 0% after 20 days \nof treatment. After 4 days of incubation, the collapse of the germinal \nlayer was observed in 60 \u00b1 5.8% and 83.3 \u00b1 12.0% of cysts treated \nwith 50 and 100 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. Whilst ultrastructural damage \nwas observed in the cysts obtained from  S. aristata  or ABZ treated \nmice, no significant differences in the weight of the cysts were ob -\ntained (P > 0.05).

In previous \nstudies we have shown that topical application of Lactobacillus plan -\ntarum  ( Lp ) cultures favored the healing process . In this work  we \ninvestigated the effect of Lp on the microbicidal activity of polymor -\nphonuclear cells (PMNs) infected with Staphylococcus aureus ( S. \naureus ).\nMaterial and methods:   Diabetic patients with ulcers were treated \nwith a topical application of Lp.   Biopsies were taken at day 0, 10 \nand 30 post- treatments. Histopathological and bacteriological stud -\nies were performed. At the same time, circulating blood polymor -\nphonuclear cells (PMNs) were isolated from patients. PMNs were \nstimulated with Lp and culture supernatant to perform the following \ntests: phagocytosis by flow cytometry, NETosis by fluorometry and \nmicrobicial activity. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (S. \naureus ) isolated from the ulcer was used as infectious strain in all \ntests. The effect of Lp on the biofilm and cell viability of S. aureus  \nwas measure.  \nResults:  PMNs from healthy patients was used as control group. \nIncreased phagocytic activity of PMNs was observed in healthy \npatients only stimulated with LPS (230 ifm vs 402 ifm p <0.001). \nThe same was also observed for diabetic PMNs (210 ifm vs 460 p \n<0.001). The PMNs of healthy patients showd greater induction of \nNETosiss (4000 RFU) vs PMN of diabetics (2000 RFU). A significant \nincrease in NETosis (6000 RFU) and microbicial activity of PMNs \nof diabetics stimulated with Lp or with supernatant was observed. \nS. aureus   were able to produce biofilm. The effect of Lp on mature \nbiofilm, showed significant differences in terms of biomasa reduction \nwhen compared to the controls.\nConclusions:    The treatment with Lp improve wound healing, sup -\npressing of S. aureus  infection at wound sites and promoting host \ninnate immunity.12.

The \ninner leaf gel contain active compounds with prebiotic activity on \nbeneficial microbiota, while others compounds inhibit the growth of \npathogenic bacteria.\nClostridioides difficile  (C. difficile ), is a Gram-positive bacillus, an -\naerobic, spore-forming, that constitutes the major cause of hospi -\ntal-acquired diarrhea, often in association with previous antibiotic \nuse. C. difficile infection (CDI) treatment is based on oral administra -\ntion of metronidazole and vancomycin. The emergence and spread \nof C. difficile  isolates resistant to multiple antibiotics, especially the \nhypervirulent ribotype 027 strains, are becoming an increasing prob -\nlem for CDI treatment. \nWe evaluate the AV effect on C. difficile growth, and its impact in \ncombination with metronidazole and vancomycin. The antibacterial \nactivity of AV was determined by broth microdilution assays using \nthe hypervirulent C. difficile (027/BI/NAP1) strain. The bacteria were \ncultured in anaerobiosis for 48h, seeded in triplicates in 96 microw -\nell plates in the presence of AV \u00b1 antibiotics. After 48h, C. difficile  \ngrowth was determined in a microplate reader at 600nm. Two vari -\neties of AV were used, Aloe barbadensis Miller  and Aloe saporina , \nin final concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 30%. The minimal \ninhibitory concentration (MIC) for metronidazole and vancomycin \nwas calculated and the AV gel was used in combination with 0.25, \n0.5, 1 and 2\u00b5g/ml of each antibiotic. The results indicated that AV \ngel inhibits C. difficile growth (p<0.01) and significantly reduces the \nMIC of metronidazole and vancomycin (p<0.05). This first evidence \npositions AV as a potential promising combination therapy against \nC. difficile,  reducing the concentration of antibiotics treatment and \nthe detrimental consequences on the beneficial microbiota.

Aim to pro -\nvide the first microbiome portrait of oral and anal mucosa from a \ncohort of HIV- and HIV+ MSM and TGW from Argentina. Methods  \nEighty samples of DNA derived from 40 oral swabs (OS) & 40 anal ABSTRACTS83\nswabs (AS) were provided by 45 participants. Shotgun metage -\nnomics sequencing was conducted with the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 \nSystem. NGS data analysis was performed using CosmosID, Hum -\nman3, and R/Bioconductor.  Results  In AS HPV types  were among \nthe most frequent virus, while Prevotella copri  and Prevotella cor -\nporis  were among the most abundant bacteria. OS were character -\nized by the prevalence of KSHV , EBV, HSV-2  and HHV-7 , among \nothers; while species of Haemophilus , Rothia , and Neisseria  were \nthe most frequent bacteria. Comparisons between HIV+ and HIV-\n, considering MSM and TGW, together or separately, indicated a \ndistinctive set of differentially abundant taxa for each comparison \n(LogFC>1.5, p<0.001). In OS KSHV  was predominantly abundant \nin HIV+ patients independently of sexual orientation. AS of HIV+ \npatients showed enrichment mainly in HPV types. For bacteria, \nspecies of Prevotella , Leptotrichia , Veillonella , Fusobacterium, Di -\nalister  were significantly abundant in HIV+ patients independently \nof the condition MSM or TGW.  Next, we analyzed the functional \nprofiling to describe the metabolic potential of the microbial com -\nmunity in a multivariable association between phenotypes and mi -\ncrobial features. Distinctive pathways (n~200) defined OS and AS \n(q < 0.05). Moreover, we identified differential pathways (q<0.05) \nassociated with HIV condition and anal intraepithelial lesions, such \nas ADP-L-glycero-beta-D-mannoheptose and preQ0 biosynthesis,  \nrespectively. Conclusion  Our results reinforce the occurrence of \noncogenic viromes in this high HIV-risk population and show that \nmetabolic pathways generated by bacteria associated with HIV-in -\nfection could modulate environmental conditions related to inflam -\nmation and carcinogenesis.\n14. (066)  IDENTIFICATION OF LONG NON-CODING RNAS \nASSOCIATED TO THE CMS MOLECULAR SUBTYPES AS \nPREDICTIVE BIOMARKERS OF RESPONSE TO THERA -\nPY IN COLORECTAL CANCER.\nDenisse Saulnier, Martin C Abba, Ezequiel Lacunza.\nCINIBA, Facultad de Ciencias M\u00e9dicas, Universidad Nacio -\nnal de La Plata, Argentina\nThe consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) of colorectal cancer \n(CRC) define tumor heterogeneity at the gene-expression level. The \nclinical utility of the CMS classification resides in the possibility to \nestimate survival (prognostic value) and select patients for both che -\nmotherapy and currently used targeted agents (predictive value). \nLong Non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been largely associated with \ncancer constituting an essential approach for the search and iden -\ntification of these biomarkers. Aim: To identify lncRNA signatures \nwith prognostic and predictive value associated with each CMS sub -\ntype. Methods : We performed an integrative bioinformatics analysis \non GDC-TCGA-CRC dataset (n=674), considering CMS and SFM \nbased-classification that discriminate tumor microenvironment and \ndrug sensitivity. We first classify tumors in CMSs.  We annotated \nlncRNAs (n=14084) and applied DESeq2 for the comparison of \neach CMS (CMSk) versus the rest (CMSK-k; pvalue <0.01, Log -\nFC> 1). The obtained lists of the up-modulated lncRNAs exclusive \nof each CMS were evaluated according to CRC molecular features; \nthe immune, stromal or epithelial tumor component; and the prog -\nnostic and predictive value (p<0.05). Furthermore, we evaluated \ntheir association to systemic and targeted therapies (SFM) and \nthe potential to be detected in peripheral blood of CRC patients. \nResults : we identified lncRNAs that recapitulate the intrinsic fea -\ntures of the CMS: lncRNA-CMS1 associated with poor prognosis, \nimmune component, resistance to chemotherapy and response to \nanti-EGFR therapies. LncRNA-CMS2/CMS3 associated with good \nprognosis, epithelial component and response to anti-EGFR/VEGF. \nLncRNA-CMS4 showed high expression in mesenchymal-like tu -\nmors with poor prognosis but responsive to traditional chemother -\napies. Many of these lncRNAs are detected in peripheral blood of \nCRC patients. Conclusion : CMS-lncRNA signatures predictive of \ntherapy response constitute valuable biomarkers to be assessed in \npreclinical models.\n15.

While considerable progress \nhas been made on treatment efficacy and survival rates, about 15-\n30% of patients relapse and/or die. Immunotherapies are promis -\ning as complementary treatments to chemotherapy, yet the most \nrelevant therapy targets and patient subsets remain unclear. Aims : \nTo characterize immune cell types in the BM microenvironment of \nALL samples using predictive bioinformatic tools on transcriptome \ndata. Methods : we performed RNA-seq on BM samples collected \nat ALL diagnosis (N=32). The proportion of immune cells was es -\ntimated using MIXTURE through two gene expression signatures \n(LM22, TIL10). A \u201ccytolytic score\u201d reflecting CD8+ cytotoxic T lym -\nphocytes (CTLs) and Natural Killer cells (NK) abundance was cal -\nculated as the geometric mean of 5 genes specifically expressed \nin CTLs/NK. Gene set enrichment analysis using ImmuneSigDB \nand Reactome was performed with GSVA package in R. Results : \nRelative proportions of B and T cells were concordant with B- and \nT-cell ALL subtype, respectively. Cytolytic score was positively cor -\nrelated with CD8+ T cells and NK proportions (Spearman Rho>0.38, \np-val<0.05). Higher CD8+ T cell and NK could be associated with \nworse event-free survival (hazard ratio=5.39, 95%CI: 0.64-44.98, \nCoxP p-val=0.08). 12.5% (4/32) of samples showed a cytolytic \nZ-score > 1, and half of them relapsed or died. Gene set enrichment \nanalysis for >1 vs. <1 cytolytic Z-score resulted in statistically signif -\nicant enrichment in genesets related to activation of CD8+ T cells, \nimmune cell trafficking, and BM niche signaling. Conclusions : we \nidentified a subset of B-ALL patients with increased abundance of \nCD8+ T cells/NK, suggesting potential candidates for immunother -\napies. Given the small sample size, these observations should be \nconfirmed in additional patients. \n16.

The absence of FMRP due to an expansion of > 200 \nCGG repeats in the 5\u2032UTR of the gene (full mutation), is responsi -\nble for the Fragile X syndrome (FXS) while the premutation state is \nassociated with the Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome \n(FXTAS) and Fragile X-associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency \n(FXPOI).\nRecently, a microRNA (miRNA) cluster adjacent to FMR1 (Fx-mir ) \nhas been described in placental mammals and it has been shown \nthat a number of miRNAs in the cluster target FMR1 in human and \nmouse, regulating its expression. In this work we described the  Fx-\nmir cluster and the putative targets of its miRNAs in Rattus norvegi -\ncus (rat). In particular, we were interested in studying whether some \nof the Fx- mir  miRNAs target Fmr1 in the rat as well.\nWe used public access databases and performed a reciprocal best MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

We found a total \nof 18 miRNAs located in the Fx-mir cluster in rat and among them, \n8 with a conserved seed region and chromosome location between \nboth species.\nNext, to study putative targets of Fx-mir  miRNAs, we searched for \nmiRNAs predicted to target Fmr1  using the gene of interest as input \nin specialized target finding softwares. We also made the reverse \nsearch, finding every possible target for each miRNA of Fx-mir . We \nfound that miR-880 is a possible regulator of Fmr1.\nFinally, we extended the search to all of the X chromosome genome \nsequence, finding 8 more candidates predicted to target Fmr1  that \nmight be of interest.\n17.

Although \nmuch attention has been placed in virus host cell receptors, little has \nbeen described about the anti-viral proteins. It is well accepted that \ntype I interferon (IFN) is essential in fighting viral infection by induc -\ntion of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which work in synergy to inhibit \nviral replication via multiple mechanisms. In this work, we aimed at \nevaluating the expression profiles of several genes associated with \nthe IFN pathway in response to the infection with SARS-CoV-2 in \nCOVID-19 positive patients vs. COVID-19 negative patients. We \nperformed bioinformatics analyses in a case-control study from \nSARS-CoV-2 positive (n=403) and negative (n=54) patients. Sam -\nples were obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs. We analyzed the \ndifferential expression of the IFN-associated genes alongside with \ntheir correlation with other clinical parameters such as age, sex and \nviral load. Results show a significant downregulation of IFGNR1, \nSTAT6, JUN, MAP3K1, CEBPB, and RAPGEF1 in COVID-19 posi -\ntive patients. We also found a significant correlation between most \nof the genes and the viral load. No significant differences were ob -\nserved between gene expression and age or sex. In summary, our \nstudy findings support the role of IFN and IFN-associated genes in \nSARS-CoV-2 infection, pointing out to new potential drugable tar -\ngets in order to achieve a better anti-viral response.\n18.

Among other pleiotropic \neffects on virus-infected host cells, ivermectin (IVM) inhibits nuclear \ntransport mechanisms mediated by importins and atorvastatin (ATV) \naffects actin cytoskeleton-dependent trafficking controlled by Rho \nGTPases signaling. In this work we first analyzed the response to \ninfection in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2-positive and \n-negative patients by assessing gene expression of the respec -\ntive host cell drug targets importins and Rho GTPases. COVID-19 \npatients showed alterations in KPNA3, KPNA5, KPNA7, KPNB1, \nRHOA and CDC42 expression compared with non-COVID-19 pa -\ntients. An in vitro  model of infection with Poly(I:C), a synthetic analog \nof viral double-stranded RNA, triggered NF-\u03baB activation, an effect \nthat was halted by IVM and ATV treatment. Importin and Rho GT -\nPases gene expression was also impaired by these drugs. Further, \nby confocal microscopy we analyzed the effects of IVM and ATV on \nnuclear to cytoplasmic importin \u03b1 distribution, alone or in combina -\ntion. Results showed a significant inhibition of importin \u03b1 nuclear \naccumulation under IVM and ATV treatments. For gene expression \nanalysis we performed two-tailed Welch\u2019s t tests or Wilcoxon rank \nsum test. For correlations Spearman\u2019s rank coefficient was calculat -\ned. In cellular studies, Mann-Whitney or t-tests were used. In case \nof more than 2 experimental groups, ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis anal -\nysis were used. Differences were considered statistically significant \nat a level of p<0.05. Data processing and statistical analysis was \nperformed using Prism 6.1 Software and R. These findings con -\nfirm transcriptional alterations in importins and Rho GTPases upon \nSARS-CoV-2 infection and point out to IVM and ATV as valid drugs \nto impair nuclear localization of importin \u03b1 when used at clinical -\nly-relevant concentrations.\n19.

In this sense, studying possible \nchanges in the intestinal microbiota related to the initiation, progres -\nsion and response to treatment of patients with autoimmune diseas -\nes, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), is an interesting \nfield which promotes a comprehensive view of chronic inflammatory \nprocesses of increasing incidence worldwide. In the present study \nwe aim to describe the unknown gut microbiota of SLE-patients of \nthe Argentine population in comparison with healthy individuals in \norder to find novel SLE-biomarkers in our region.\nMETHODS: We evaluated 24 non-SLE-controls and 13 SLE-pa -\ntients, from the metropolitan area of\nBuenos Aires, Argentina. Fecal DNA was extracted and  hypervari -\nable regions V3-V4 of the bacterial 16SR-gene were sequenced us -\ning a MiSeq-Platform. Sequences were analyzed with the QIIME2 \nenvironment and differential functional pathways were evaluated \nusing PICRUSt. RESULTS: In SLE-patients we found no signifi -\ncant differences in alpha diversity compared to non-SLE-control. \nHowever, Beta diversity was significantly different between groups \n(UniFrac distances, PERMANOVA, p-value <0.05). Additionally, \nfunctional metabolic pathways  were analyzed and it was found that \nSLE patients have different metabolic  capabilities compared to the \ncontrol group. Six metabolic pathways were  found from the Metacyc \ndatabase mainly associated with the degradation  of aromatic com -\npounds and fatty acid biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our \nstudy provides new knowledge  on the gut microbiota composition \nof our population, allowing the  association of local changes in gut ABSTRACTS85\nmicrobial diversity in SLE.\n20.

While considerable progress has been made on treatment \nefficacy and survival rates, about 15-30% of patients relapse and/\nor die. We aimed to identify gene-expression profiles in childhood \nALL that could help better predict disease outcome, response to \ntreatment and therapy-related toxicity. We collected 39 bone mar -\nrow samples at time of diagnosis of ALL from 3 hospitals from Ar -\ngentina. Total RNA was isolated to perform transcriptome analysis \n(RNAseq). Clinico-pathological characteristics and disease outcome \nwere evaluated and recorded by oncohematologists. We analyzed \ndifferential gene expression (DGE) and gene set variation analysis \n(GSVA) comparing: early response to prednisone, event-free surviv -\nal, risks group, acute toxicity and minimal residual disease at day 15. \nWe observed that about 30% of dysregulated genes were non-cod -\ning RNAs, being long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) the predominant \nbiotype. We identified 6 differentially expressed pathways relevant \nto ALL biology (p<0.01) and 7 lncRNAs (MIR99AHG, LINC02866, \nZNF385D-AS2, LINC02848, MYO18B-AS1, Lnc-PPDPFL-1, Lnc-\nRIT2-2; padj\u22640.05) among ALL risk groups. Because the biological \nactivity of most lncRNAs is still unknown and under the hypothesis \nthat lncRNAs modulate biochemical pathways, we calculated the \ncorrelation between significant lncRNA and pathway expressions. \nWe found that MYO18B-AS1 positively correlated with \u201cinactivation \nof MAPKK activity\u201d (r=0.4;p=0.02) and LINC02866 negatively cor -\nrelated with \u201cCXCR3 chemokine receptor binding\u201d (r=-0.4;p=0.02) \nand \u201ctransmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase activi -\nty\u201d (r=-0.4;p=0.01). This study identified dysregulated lncRNAs and \nbiochemical pathways that might be relevant in the pathology of \nchildhood ALL.  The analysis of these gene-expression profiles at \ndiagnosis might help improving risk stratification, therapy efficacy \nand reducing the occurrence of relapse and toxicity. \n21.

However, having \nto search for a specific gene in multiple datasets can often be time \nconsuming and unfriendly to novel bioinformaticians. Our aim was \nto develop a user-friendly search tool to access simultaneously data \nof differential expression analyses for a particular gene or even gene \nsignatures across multiple datasets.\nFor this purpose, 7 publicly available transcriptomic prostate cancer \n(PCa) datasets (n total= 875) were selected to either be used by re -\nsearchers interested in PCa or as an example to understand the tool before adapting it to their specific need, and differential expression \nanalyses were performed in R, using the limma package. A Shiny -\nbased tool, that can be accessed through a user interface, was then \nbuilt to execute the search.\nOur Shiny  app includes a search bar that allows researchers to look \nfor either a specific gene or a family of genes within all the datasets. \nSearch results are presented in tables containing information on the \ncomparison made for the analysed dataset, the gene ID and symbol, \nt and B statistical parameters, the log Fold Change, the p-value, \nadjusted p-value and the dataset\u2019s GSE identifier. Additionally, us -\ners can also plot different variables to visualize gene expression in \nall selected datasets more easily. Among the options, clinical sig -\nnificance of a gene can be assessed by overall survival and Ka -\nplan-Meier plots.\nIn summary, Gene Hunter  is a novel Shiny -based tool with the po -\ntential to ease high-throughput analyses in basic cancer research. It \ndoes so by providing the opportunity to explore differential expres -\nsion between tumoral conditions, while straddling the limits of indi -\nvidual studies. This platform has the potential to extend to dataset \ncomprehending other pathologies.\n22. (234) META-ANALYSIS OF HVEM EXPRESSION IN \nBREAST AND BRAIN CANCER\nAntonela S.

Since HVEM expression \nhas been detected in breast cancer (BRCA) and glioma biopsies, we \nperformed a meta-analysis of transcriptomic data from The Cancer \nGenome Atlas to assess the expression of HVEM in these tumors. \nIn BRCA biopsies, we found that HVEM expression is higher in nor -\nmal vs. tumoral tissue, being lower in triple negative BRCA (TNBC) \nbiopsies than in other BRCA subtypes. In TNBC, the expression \nof HVEM correlated with the expression of lymphocytic activation \nmarkers such as HLA-DR (r: 0,7109) and CD69 (r: 0,6013), but also \nwith exhaustion markers as CTLA4 (r: 0,6349), PDL1 (r: 0,5331), \nLAG3 (r: 0,6547) and TIM3 (r: 0,6663). Even though HVEM expres -\nsion did not show association with TNBC patient survival, its expres -\nsion was positively correlated with the expression of gene signatures \ncorresponding to helper and cytotoxic T cells, Tregs, macrophages \nand dendritic cells (DC). As for glioma biopsies, HVEM expression \nwas higher in gliomas carrying wild-type IDH, an enzyme whose \nmutation has been recently associated with better prognosis. In ad -\ndition, HVEM expression correlated with the aggressiveness of gli -\noma subtypes, being higher in glioblastoma (GBM). In GBM, HVEM \npositively correlated with HLA-DR (r: 0,5021), CD69 (r: 0,4460), \nCTLA4 (r: 0,3721), PDL1 (r: 0,3725) and TIM3 (r: 0,5136). Although \nHVEM expression was not associated with patient survival, it cor -\nrelated with the expression of helper and cytotoxic T cells, DC and \nmacrophages. These results suggest that the pathways triggered by \nHVEM may have different outcomes depending on the tissue and \ntumor subtype, and that this checkpoint should be studied in depth \nas a target for cancer treatment.\n23.

This task is often performed using \nmicroscopy over immunohistochemical (IHQ) staining applied on \ntissue samples, on which several specialists judge the tissue con -\ndition following specific criteria. However, this task is proven to be \nprone to high inter- and intra-subject variance, which raises the \nneed to elaborate more robust tools and frameworks to assist on \nthis task. The recent influx of deep learning technologies, which are \nproven to be successful in a variety of contexts, appears to be an \nadequate alternative in this context. In this aim, we present a joint \neffort between research groups from Cancer Biology Laboratory \n(INIBIBB-CONICET) and the Imaging Sciences Laboratory (LCI-\nUNS-CONICET). Starting with IHQ stained images taken with Olym -\npus CX31 microscope from thyroid and breast cancer biopsies, we \napplied a Mask C-RNN network for cell nuclei detection. For this \npurpose, we retrained the net with a series of labeled examples pro -\nvided by the biochemical specialists. After this initial detection, a ROI \nwas determined surrounding the nuclei, within which the proportion \nof diaminobenzidine stain (brown-colored precipitation) is computed \nas a proxy indicator of the Immunoreactive Score (IRS). For this, a \nRandom Forest classifier was trained using stain/no stain labeled \npixels also provided by the experts. The results appear promising \nin the sense that the resulting system is able to consistently provide \nmalignancy assessment even in difficult cases or when the quality of \nthe microscopy acquisition is below standard.\n24.

Men treated with proxalutamide \nin a recent clinical trial, showed reduced COVID-19 hospitaliza -\ntion rate. In this work we assessed gene expression profiles and \nandrogen regulation of the main host cell receptors described for \nSARS-CoV-2 and potential antiviral genes involved in response to \ncoronavirus infection.\nMultiple bioinformatics analyses were performed to study host cell \nreceptors and antiviral proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the \ngene expression changes upon ADT was assessed. We used pub -\nlicly available datasets from: a) SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative \npatients\u2019 nasopharyngeal swabs at time of diagnosis (GSE152075, \nn=453), b) SARS-CoV-2 infected human cell lines and ferrets \n(GSE1407507), c) ChIP-seq experiments evaluating androgen re -\nceptor binding (GSE66037, GSE28950, GSE108704).\nResults showed that SARS-CoV-2 positive cases had higher MX1 \nexpression, and multivariable regression showed that MX1 expres -\nsion significantly increased with viral load. Also, MX1 was signifi -cantly up-regulated in tracheal samples from ferrets intranasally \ninfected with SARS-CoV-2. Similar results were found in A549 and \nCalu3 lung cell lines. Since ADT might result in a therapeutic advan -\ntage against COVID-19, we next evaluated MX1 regulation by dihy -\ndrotestosterone (DHT). First, comparable MX1 levels in lung, pros -\ntate and salivary gland of healthy humans were observed (GTEx). \nLNCaP cells treated with DHT showed a decrease (p<0.05) in MX1 \nmRNA levels. ChIP-seq experiments showcased AR binding sites \non the MX1 sequence upon DHT. Further, comparison of paired PCa \npatient\u2019s samples before and after ADT showed MX1 upregulation \n(p<0.05) after ADT.\nIn summary, MX1 raises as a critical responder in SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection and we demonstrate MX1 modulation by DHT. We propose \nMX1 as a key player in the therapeutic advantage posed by ADT. \n25.

Casal, Cristina Ibarra, Mar\u00eda M. \nAmaral, Claudia Silberstein.\nIFIBIO HOUSSAY, Departamento de Cs. Fisiol\u00f3gicas, Facul -\ntad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires.\nShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli  is responsible for Hemolytic \nUremic Syndrome (HUS), a cause of renal failure in children. Renal \ndamage has been associated with Shiga toxin (Stx), which binds to \nthe globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) receptor on the plasma membrane \nof target cells. We have previously shown that Eliglustat (EG), an \ninhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (GLS), the first step of gly -\ncosphingolipids pathway, also inhibits Gb3 expression and prevents \nthe cytotoxic effects of Shiga toxin type 2 (Stx2) in human cortical \nrenal tubular epithelial cells (HRTEC) primary cultures. The aim of \nthis work was to clarify the mode of interaction of EG in the ac -\ntive site of GLS and its possible interaction with Stx2 and Gb3, and \ncompare to Gb3 expression in HRTEC treated with EG and Stx2. \nFor this, a computational procedure called molecular docking was \ncarried out with Smina software and Gibbs free energy was calculat -\ned for determining the stability of the conformation formed between \nthe ligand and the receptor. On the other hand, the expression of \nGb3 receptor was analyzed by TLC in samples of HRTEC treated \nwith EG (50 nM, 24 h) in the presence and absence of Stx2 (1 ng/\nml). Docking analysis showed that EG presents an in silico  9-fold \nselectivity over GLS in comparison with Stx2, suggesting a stronger \naffinity between EG and GLS. These results were according to TLC \nassay, which showed that EG significantly inhibits Gb3 expression \nat 24 h. Besides, HRTEC cultures co-treated with EG+Stx2, showed \na similar significant decrease in Gb3 expression. The incubation of \nHRTEC with Stx2 alone maintained the same Gb3 expression level \nas control non-treated cells. These results demonstrate that Stx2 \ndoes not interfere with Eliglustat effect on Gb3 inhibition. Study sup -\nported by PUE0041, CONICET.\n26.

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has \ncaused over 4.6 million deaths as of September 2021. The influenza \nvirus hemagglutinin (HA) and coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins \nmediate virus entry. HA and S are heavily glycosylated, making them \npotential targets for carbohydrate binding agents such as lectins. \nWe have previously isolated a mannose-binding sunflower lectin \n(Helja) that showed the ability to inhibit hemagglutination mediated ABSTRACTS87\nby influenza, suggesting the binding of Helja to the HA glycoprotein. \nHere we evaluated the interaction of Helja both to influenza virus \nantigens and to the receptor binding domain of S (RBD). Using a \nligand blot assay, the interaction of Helja with antigens of the H1N1 \nand H3N2 variants of the influenza A was demonstrated. Also, using \nan experimental strategy based on the interaction of Helja with man -\nnose-agarose matrices, the ability of the Victoria variant antigens of \ninfluenza B to detach the lectin bound to the affinity matrix was ob -\nserved. We used a similar experimental approach to detect the pres -\nence of a protein recognized by anti-Helja antibodies in the fractions \neluted from affinity matrix by competence with RBD. These findings \nsuggested the interaction of Helja with viral surface glycoproteins \nof influenza and SARS-CoV-2 that play a key role in the entry of \nboth viruses into the host cells.

Department of Chemistry - Biomedical Centre, Uppsala \nUniversity, Uppsala, Sweden.\nNKX2-5  is a homeobox gene of very early expression in humans. It \ncodes for NKX2-5, a transcription factor that regulates the expres -\nsion of a number of other transcription factors involved in the devel -\nopment and function of the early heart, among other functions. This \ngene was the first where a single genetic variant (GV) was related to \ncongenital heart disease (CHD).\nOur group recently compiled, curated and structured an exhaustive \ndatabase of all GVs in the gene. In this study, we aimed to expand \nthis information by predicting the effect of some GVs in the func -\ntionality of the NKX2-5  protein. In order to do that, we proposed a \nclassification of all  possible missense GVs in the structured region \nof the protein  according to the most probable effect they would have \non its functionality.\nWe worked with all the possible amino acid variants caused by a \nchange in a single DNA base pair in the homeodomain (HD) region \n(n=337). The in silico studies included an estimation of protein-DNA \ninteraction, protein stability, prediction of linear motifs that could be \naffected by the variant and evolutive conservation. Taken together, \nthese results were used to obtain a classification of the possible \neffect of GVs on the functionality of NKX2-5.\nOur analysis determined that 32 GVs may affect the interaction with \nDNA (9.5%), 10 may have an effect on functionality due to introduc -\ning a  cysteine (3.0%), 38 may affect a known linear motif (11.3%) \nand 135 are predicted to affect protein stability and/or a putative \nlinear motif (40.0%).\nThis analysis allowed us to estimate the potential effect of GVs on \nNKX2-5. In particular, it contributes  to a functional prediction of yet \nunknown GVs, it proposes  a mechanism for pathogenesis of known \nGVs and it helps  to better understand the genotype-phenotype rela -\ntionship in the development of CHD.\n28. (333) LARGE SCALE BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSIS OF \nCRISPR-CAS13 AS NOVEL SARS-COV-2 ANTIVIRAL\nPeralta T.M1; Nu\u00f1ez Pedrozo C.N1; Locatelli P1, Crottogini A1, \nOlea F.D1, Cuniberti L1.\nInstituto de Medicina Traslacional, Trasplante y Bioingenier\u00eda (IMETTYB-Universidad Favaloro-CONICET).  \nObjectives: The aim of this study was to assess the alignment rate \nof two distinct CRISPR-Cas13 crRNAs collections in one million \nSARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences.\nMaterials and Methods: The crRNAs collections were designed us -\ning the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome and lacked alignment to the \nhuman transcriptome. The first collection had crRNAs targeting the \nNSP13 (Helicase), while the second collection had crRNAs targeting \nthe overlapping regions NSP1-NSP2, NSP2-NSP3, NSP3-NSP4, \nNSP4-NSP5 and NSP5-NSP6 that code for the cleavage sites of \nthe viral proteases PLpro and Mpro. Each collection had five crRNA \n23-nucleotides long. The SARS-CoV-2 database consisted of one \nmillion sequences retrieved from GISAID belonging to the period \nDecember 2019 - March 2021. The crRNA alignment to the data -\nbase was made by command line BLAST (v2.11) and only align -\nments with 100% complementary rate were consider in the t-test \nanalysis.\nResults: The first collection had an alignment rate of 99.44% \n(SD\u00b10.22%), while the second one had an alignment rate of 99.46% \n(SD\u00b10.28). There was no significant difference between collections \n(p-value: 0.8). Four crRNAs of either collection were needed to ob -\ntain a 100% coverage on the million sequences.\nConclusion: Bioinformatic research revealed a high alignment rate \nof crRNAs to a million SARS-CoV-2 sequences, thus validating \nCRISPR-Cas13 as a reliable antiviral. There was no difference in \nthe alignment rate of crRNA collections designed to target either a \nsingle NSP or overlapping regions of many NSP, so viral regions \nwith known high conservation rate should suffice for an optimal \ndesign of crRNAs. In this research we found that 4 crRNAs were \nenough to target all studied viral sequences, which is in accordance \nto previous studies showing that 5 crRNAs would be necessary to \ntarget individual species of coronavirus. Here we provide the first \nlarge scale analysis regarding the alignment success of crRNAs in \none million viral sequences.\n29.

To understand the mechanisms underlying the protumor -\nigenic role of Galectin-1 (Gal1) and associated glycans in colitis-as -\nsociated colorectal cancer (CACRC). \nMaterials & Methods.  We performed transcriptomic analysis of tu -\nmor samples from WT and Gal1 KO mice in an experimental model \nof CACRC (azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium, AOM-DSS). Total \nRNA was extracted, purified, and sequenced. Sequencing data was \npre-processed with FastQC and Trimmomatic, and pseudo-counts \nwere estimated using Kallisto. Downstream analyses were run us -\ning R software v3.6. Immune infiltrate deconvolution was performed \nusing MIXTURE with ImmuCC-seq signature. Enrichment analyses \nwere performed using GSEAbase package. KO vs. WT compari -\nsons were performed using Wilcoxon test.\nResults.  We recently reported the immunosuppressive role of Gal1 \nin AOM-DSS through modulation of the CD8+ regulatory T cell com -\npartment, with significantly decreased tumor number and volume \nin Gal1 KO mice. Here, we performed transcriptomics analysis in \nWT and Gal1 KO mice treated with AOM-DSS. Differential expres -\nsion analysis and functional enrichment showed downregulation \nof angiogenesis-associated pathways (p<0.05). Moreover, pertur -\nbation-response analysis of 14 key cancer-associated processes \nshowed that Gal1 KO mice presented lower scores for VEGF, Hipox -\nia, TNFa and NFkB, and higher score of Trail pathways (p<0.01). \nImmune infiltrate composition in KO mice showed a higher absolute \nscore together with higher CD8+ T cell, B cell and monocyte pro -MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 202188\nportions, and lower macrophage proportion (p<0.05). Lastly, Lgals1  \nexpression was highly correlated with a set of 148 genes which in -\ncluded Il1b, Tmem176b  and Nfkbia .\nConclusion.  Our results shed light into the mechanisms associated \nwith the protumorigenic role of Gal1 in CACRC. We propose that \nGal-1 can promote an immunosuppressive TME while promoting an -\ngiogenesis and immune-evasion related pathways that contributes \nto tumor growth and disease progression.\n30.

In this work we used \nthe Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm (RFE) to select a set \nof genes associated with tumour recurrence condition after 5-fluo -\nrouracil (5-FU) based chemotherapy in a group of colorectal cancer \n(CRC) patients. In combination, we used the RankProd algorithm, \nto filter the selected genes that were also differentially expressed \n(FDR>0,05). The list of genes was entered in the Library of Integrat -\ned Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) database to identify \nthose compounds with the greatest probability to reverse the resis -\ntance-associated gene expression profile obtained.\nAmong the proposed candidate drugs, we selected irinotecan (anti -\nneoplastic),  ivermectin (antiparasitic) and amitriptyline (antidepres -\nsant). By MTT-based proliferation assays evaluated their effect on \nthe proliferation capacity on 5-FU sensitive and resistant CRC cell \nlines. \nWe found that both drugs further reduced the proliferation of 5-FU \nresistant CRC cells (P<0,05). Our preliminary results suggest that \nivermectin and amitriptyline have a potential 5-FU resistance rever -\nsal effect which have yet to be studied.\n31.

Instituto de Qu\u00ed -\nmica Biol\u00f3gica de la Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Natura -\nles (IQUIBICEN), Buenos Aires, CP1428, Argentina.\nMost of the human genome is transcribed into non-coding RNAs \nwhich perform a myriad of tasks in cells. Their dysregulation is re -\nsponsible of the development and progression of different patho -\nlogical processes, including cancer. Prostate cancer is known for \nhaving a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes, ranging from an in -\ndolent tumor to a lethal metastatic castration resistant cancer \n(CRPC). But the biology of the processes leading to these pheno -\ntypes is still mostly unknown. The aim of this study was to identify \nlncRNAs involved in the progression of prostate tumors to CRPC. \nWe browed public repositories and downloaded raw RNAseq data \nfrom primary prostate adenocarcinomas (pre- and post-androgen \ndeprivation therapy (ADT); n=40 and n=11, respectively) and CRPC \n(n=8). We performed differential expression of 17,009 lncRNAs \nusing R/Bioconductor. We identified 12 lncRNAs that responded \nto ADT and were further dysregulated in CRPC: PCA3, PCAT18, \nPCGEM1, LINC01095, GABRG3-AS1, HECW2-AS1, NKILA , \nLOC100506474, SLCA4-AS1, LOC101927870, LOC101929532, \nand LOC105377503 . Interestingly, three of them were widely re -\nported as players in prostate cancer development and progression, validating the pipeline used in this study. Unsupervised clustering \nanalysis revealed that the 12-lncRNA-expression pattern could clus -\nter post-ADT and CRPC samples apart. Primary tumors pre-ADT \nwere more heterogeneous and clustered together with post-ADT \nor CRPC tumors. This suggests that primary prostate tumors that \nmight potentially progress to CRPC could be detected at the time of \ndiagnosis according to their lncRNA expression profile. In addition, \nwe looked into promoter methylation of these lncRNAs in different \ntypes of tumors. Overall, we observed promoter hypomethylation in \nthe tumors compared with normal counterpart. These results war -\nrant further analysis in more samples and in-vitro experiments to \nvalidate the findings and determine the role of these lncRNAs in the \npathogenesis of prostate cancer.\n32.

Interest -\ningly, we have recently proposed an unexpected tumor suppressor \nrole for Vav3 in melanoma. In this tumor type, Vav proteins play \nimportant roles during development, tumor growth and metastasis. \nIn this work, we explore molecular functions associated to Vav3 in \nmelanoma by bioinformatics. First, by survival analysis tools and \nusing human patient databases, we found that Vav3 expression cor -\nrelated with patient survival (p<0.001). To explore pathways asso -\nciated to Vav3 expression levels we created two groups of patients \nwith low and high levels of Vav3. The clinical and molecular infor -\nmation was obtained from the dataset Skin Cancer Melanoma from \nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (SKCM-TCGA). We used TCGABiolinks \nand edgeR packages in R, to identify differentially expressed genes \n(DEGs; |logFC|>1 and FDR<0.01).\nThe molecular function of this group of DEGs was obtained using \nthe Panther Classification System of the Gene Ontology Consor -\ntium. Of the 579 genes categorized by molecular function, 29% of \nthem were associated to \u201cbinding function\u201d, especially \u201cprotein bind -\ning\u201d (51.2%), and 18.5% to \u201ccatalytic function\u201d, especially \u201chydrolase \nactivity\u201d (57.9%). With this set of DEGs we performed a Gene Set \nFunctional Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). As expected, we observed \nan enrichment for the Rho GTPase pathway in patients with high \nVav3 expression, and pathways related to both innate and adaptive \nimmune system (FDR<0.25), such as the interleukin-2 and gamma \ninterferon pathways.\nOur preliminary data suggest that Vav3 could be associated to a \ntranscriptional program that controls immune responses in melano -\nma.\n33.

Mounting evidence points at a critical role for ICMT in can -\ncer. Our previous work showed that ICMT overexpression enhanced \ntumorigenesis in vivo  using xenografts in immunocompromised \nmice. In this work, we wondered if ICMT may enhance tumorigen -ABSTRACTS89\nesis in inmmunocompetent mice. To answer this question, we used \nan orthotopic model of breast cancer in BALB/c mice. Our results \nshowed that ICMT enhanced tumor aggressiveness. We took ad -\nvantage of bioinformatic tools to analyze the interplay between can -\ncer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME). We first analyzed \nthe expression of ICMT in normal and tumor tissues in public data -\nbases using GEPIA 2. We found that ICMT  expression is increased \nin tumors. Interestingly, the analysis of GEO datasets showed that \nICMT  mRNA levels were significatively increased in tumor cell lines \nco-cultured with fibroblasts, suggesting that the TME contributes to \nICMT overexpression in cancer cells. By using algorithms available \nin TIMER 2.0, that allow to identify different cell types in tumor sam -\nples through deconvolution of cell-specific transcriptional programs \nfrom microarray databases, we found that ICMT  overexpression in \ntumors enhanced infiltration of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) \nand tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). We also studied if the \ncombination of ICMT  overexpression with CAFs or TAMs infiltration \naffects clinical outcome in breast cancer by correlation analysis. We \nfound that cases with low ICMT expression and low infiltration of \nthese cell types displayed a significant increase in survival. More -\nover, we found that cases with high ICMT expression and augment -\ned presence of M2-like macrophages showed reduced survival. Col -\nlectively, our results showed that ICMT overexpression enhances \ntumor progression and suggest that it contributes to reshape the \nTME.\n34.

The genomic sequence of JUNV pathogenic variant \nP3441 (P) is unknown.\nWith the objective to characterize the P variant at a molecular level, \nBHK cells were infected with the P at MOI 1. At 3 days post-infection, \ncells were harvested and TransZol reagent (TransGen Biotech) was \nused to extract total RNA. Subsequently, 2 \u00b5g of viral RNA was in -\ncubated with 1 \u00b5l Reverse Transcriptase (Superscript IV, Invitrogen) \nand random primers (50 \u00b5M, Invitrogen) for 10 min at 25\u00baC followed \nby incubation at 50\u00baC for 50 min. Then, 1 \u00b5l of cDNA was used \nas a template in each subsequent PCR using 17 pair of primers to \namplify the full genome. The amplified fragments were submitted to \nMacrogen (Korea) for capillary electrophoresis sequencing followed \nby analysis using the Ugene software. \nResults showed 59 genome differences between P and the vaccine \nattenuated Candid 1 (C#1) strain including some with potential bi -\nological functions such as the N protein R476, within a Z binding \ndomain; D511 and L546, conserved in several pathogenic strains \nand found in the Z-interacting domain; and the Z protein V64 within \nZ RING domain. L protein showed more than 40 differences with \nC#1 but their relevance is uncertain since none is within functional \ndomains. GPC proved to possess all the point mutations that have \nbeen studied by other groups. Then, specific primers were designed \nto amplify the 4 JUNV ORFs. Fragments of the expected size were \nobtained for ORFs codifying Z, N and GPC. In the case of L, four \nfragments were obtained. The fragments were subsequently cloned \nin the pGEM-T vector (Promega) following the manufacturer\u2019s in -\nstructions. Up to the present time, all ORFs have been cloned ex -\ncept for one L fragment, which is still in progress. \nWe conclude that our approach was useful to know the genome \nsequence of this viral variant as well as to make molecular tools for \nfurther studies.\n35.

In this work we \nused High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (Hi-C) to \nanalyze the changes in chromosome conformation organization and \nRNA-seq to explore changes in gene expression signatures at differ -\nent time points of in vitro  decidualization of human t-HESC cell line. \nDecidualization was induced by exposure to cAMP, E2 and either \nprogesterone or the synthetic progestin R5020. PGR and FOXO1, \nboth crucial transcription factors in decidualization, showed >4 fold \nchange increase after 3 days of treatment. On the other hand the \ndecidualization markers, PRL and IGFBP1, both displayed >20 fold \nchange increase after 3 days. At day 1 the inflammatory signature \nwas differentially upregulated (FC>2, FDR<0.01) in hormone-de -\npendent decidualization. This signature was changed at 3 and 6 \ndays, indicating distinct differential states. Global chromosome \nconformation compartments analysis through PCA of the Pearson \ncorrelation contact matrices showed extensive remodelling of A and \nB compartments and positive correlation (p-value<0.01) between B \nto A compartment changes and differential gene expression during \nhuman decidualization. In particular, the Hox genes cluster showed \ndramatic changes in looping conformation in this region and a cor -\nrelation with changes in decidual specific genes expression after 6 \ndays of treatment, indicating the increased interaction frequency \nbetween this cluster and the neighboring gene promoters. These \nresults explore novel and global human endometrial enhancer-pro -\nmoter relationships involve in human decidualization.\n36.

Zona Pellucida (ZP) and \nIZUMO1R oocyte proteins play a key role in this process, facilitating \nthe interaction and fusion between the oocyte and the sperm, re -\nspectively. Their interactions with sperm counterparts may constitute \na prezygotic reproductive isolation mechanism. The story of protein \nevolution has greatly changed with the large number of genomes \nreported as their sequencing advanced. We have improved the phy -\nlogeny of gamete interaction proteins using chromosome-resolved \ngenome assembled by Hi-C long-range sequencing. ZP isoforms \ninvolved in sperm-recognition, ZP3 and Zp2, structural cross-linker \nZP proteins, ZP1 and Zp4, and IZUMO1R evolution analysis were \nstudied among mammals, carnivora, caniformia and feliformia \ngroups. In order to detect adaptive changes in these proteins pair -\nwise sequence identity and similarity analysis were performed using \nmultiple sequence alignments. Positive selection signals were find \nusing codeml software from PAML package. The conservation of \nall carnivora gamete interaction proteins was significantly higher \n(p-value < 0.05) in felids compared to canids except for the case \nof ZP4. ZP3 and ZP2, display a similar pattern of evolution along \ntheir phylogenies showing adaptive changes in the canids subtree \nbut not among felid species. On the other hand, both ZP1 and ZP4 \ndisplay a different evolutionary history, showing signatures of posi -\ntive selection inside felids subtree. The fusion protein IZUMO1R did \nnot show positive selection among all studied phylogenetic groups. \nThese results strengthen the idea that ZPs are proteins that provide MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

It is widely used to in -\ncrease the expression and activity of hemoxigenase-1 (HO-1). HO-1 \nis a microsomal enzyme that catalyses the degradation of heme \ngroup and can be translocated to subcellular compartments. Our \nlaboratory, among others, has demonstrated that HO-1 regulates \nseveral processes related to cancer progression. The aim of this \nwork was to study the protein expression modification due to he -\nmin treatment in a murine breast cancer cell line (LM3). After hemin \nor vehicle (control) cell treatment, we performed Mass Spectrome -\ntry (MS) and Perseus proteome analyses. The proteome analysis \nshowed that 1033 from 7292 proteins detected were modulated after \nhemin treatment. We observed that 595 proteins were significantly \nincreased, including HO-1, and 353 proteins were significantly de -\ncreased in the group treated with hemin respect to their controls \n(p<0.05). ANOVA significant proteins reveal an upregulated group \nof proteins related with lipid and iron metabolism. In the group of \nproteins whose expression decreased after hemin treatment, we \nfound cytoskeleton-related proteins. The Perseus-MS-data analy -\nsis revealed that hemin treatment regulates adhesion proteins like \nvimentin and talin, actin and tubulin cytoskeletal proteins and their \nstabilizing proteins. In addition, from MS data after hemin treatment, \nwe found an increase in some cancer suppressor proteins such as \nPTEN and SMAD2/3. Finally, we found that proteases involved in \nHO-1 nuclear translocation were upregulated after hemin treatment. \nWe further corroborated some of the in-silico analysis in LM3 cell \nline by immunofluorescence and Western blot techniques. In addi -\ntion, we used a syngeneic LM3 mice model to detect by immunohis -\ntochemistry some of the regulated protein. These results show the \nmultiple physiological effects that pharmacological modulation with \nhemin has in a breast cancer cell line.\n38.

When pathological hyper -\nprolactinemia occurs, the pulsatile release of GnRH decreases and \nalters the pituitary production of FSH and LH. Furthermore, it directly \nimpairs the endocrine activity of ovarian follicles. To analyze which \novarian factors, aside to the aforementioned enzymes, respond to \na high PRL environment, an ovarian proteomic study of vizcachas \nwith sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemia was performed. For this, \novarian protein extracts from hyperprolactinemic (HPRL) and control \n(CTL) females (n=5 per group) were used. Briefly, equal amounts \nof protein were analyzed using MALDI-TOF/MS and then, LC-ESI/\nMS (Orbitrap). The resulting peptides were identified with Pro -teome Discoverer Software using the Rodentia UniProt Database, \nand functional enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID, \nSTRING and FunRich softwares. Proteins differentially expressed \nin each treatment were depicted in a volcano plot (t-test, p <0.05). \nFunctional enrichment analysis showed that 24 proteins were dif -\nferentially expressed in HPRL ovarian tissue compared to that of \nCTLs. Among those, some cytoskeleton regulation markers such \nas annexin 2 (ANXA2), Actin related protein 2/3 complex subunit \n5 like (Arpc5l), and Myosin regulatory light chain 12A (MYLC12A) \nprevailed in HPRL-ovaries, while other markers related to mito -\nchondrial function as Dynamin-1-like protein (DNM1L), Succinate -\nCoA ligase (SUCLG2), and Mitochondrial fission 1 protein (FIS1) \nwere down-regulated. In addition, the interactomes showed differ -\nent network topology with different nodal peptides in HPRL vs CTL \ntreatments. The present work showed an ovarian expression profile \nthat significantly varies under a hyperprolactinemic environment. Fi -\nnally, this report provides new markers for future investigations on \nPRL-dependent modulation of ovarian function. \n39. (565) ANALYSIS OF REGULATORY CIS-ELEMENTS AND \nFOXA1/GATA2 TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS BINDING BE -\nHIND MRP4/ABCC4 LEVELS IN PANCREATIC CANCER\nSamanta N Gancedo1, Ana Sahores1, Natalia G\u00f3mez1, Maxi -\nmiliano De Sousa-Ferro1, Carlos Davio1, and Betina Gonz\u00e1 -\nlez1\n1 Instituto de Investigaciones Farmacol\u00f3gicas, Consejo Na -\ncional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas- Universidad \nde Buenos Aires (CONICET-UBA), Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nThe multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 MRP4/ABCC4 is \nhighly expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and \nlinked to increased proliferation, a mesenchymal phenotype and \npoor prognosis. This study aimed to determine epigenetic and mo -\nlecular mechanisms that control ABCC4 expression levels in PDAC. \nSupported by bibliographic data, we selected pioneer transcription \nfactors (TFs) FOXA1 and GATA2 as candidates to regulate low vs \nhigh ABCC4 expression. We queried ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data \navailable from PDAC cell lines in GEO, and from patients tumors \nat TCGA (PAAD database). ABCC4 showed negative correlation \nwith FOXA1 and positive correlation with GATA2 in PDAC cell lines \nand patients tumors. Next, we searched for regulatory cis-elements \nin ABCC4 gene by looking for enhancer marks H3K27ac/H3K4me \nenrichment, indicative of active clusters of TF binding sites, and \nalso analyzed FOXA1 and GATA2 enrichment available in PDAC \nand prostate cell lines. We detected two candidate clusters, one \nin the distal promoter (-13.5 kb) and one in the intron1 (29.9 kb), \nthat showed positive enrichment for both FOXA1 and GATA2, and \ndifferent epigenetic landscape in low vs high ABCC4-expressing \nPDAC cell lines. To test the in silico results, we generated low-\ngrade HPAF2 and high-grade PANC1 xenografts in NGS mice, and \nevaluated FOXA1 and GATA2 immunostaining and enrichment at \nthe selected clusters in ABCC4 gene (ChIP-qPCR). HPAF2 tumors \nshowed glandular differentiation and high FOXA1 staining, where -\nas PANC1 tumors showed compact indifferentiated cells and high \nGATA2 staining. Consistently, we found specific FOXA1 enrichment \nin HPAF2, and specific GATA2 binding in PANC1, at the selected \nclusters. These findings characterize the role of pro-epithelial pio -\nneer TF FOXA1 in maintaining low levels of ABCC4 expression in \nlow-grade PDAC, and a novel role of GATA2, which could mediate \nthe increased ABCC4 expression in high-grade PDAC and contrib -\nute to the mesenchymal phenotype.\n40.

Our previ -\nous results showed that the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) \nsignificantly enhances RA-induced myeloid differentiation. APL-NB4 \ncells were treated with RA 0.1 \u03bcM in the presence or absence of \nDEX 0.5 \u03bcM and RNAseq analysis was performed. Differential gene \nexpression (FC>1.5, p-adj<0.05, LR>10) between hormone-treated \nand control (CTRL) samples from three biological replicates was cal -\nculated with DESeq2. From a total of 6983 regulated genes, 6244 \nwere regulated by RA+DEX, 5610 by RA and 204 by DEX. Most \nup (2479) and down-regulated genes (2322) between RA and RA+ -\nDEX samples are shared. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) \nrevealed that expression of genes associated with myeloid devel -\nopment (FDR q-val<1E-6) and hematopoietic stemness inhibition \n(FDR q-val<1E-6) signatures was markedly enhanced upon addition \nof DEX. Some of the 565 RA+DEX-potentiated and induced genes \n(RA+DEXup) are AIM2, FOS and TLR6. Concomitantly, peaks ob -\ntained from Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-seq analy -\nsis were associated to genes using ChIPpeakAnno, within 1mb from \nTSS. RA/RA+DEX induced differential peaks, compared to CTRL, in \n491 RA+DEXup genes, while only 53 of them were associated with \nregulated peaks due to addition of DEX. Moreover, 40.7% (200/491) \nof these genes have a peak in the promoter, whether differential \nor not, and at least one differential peak in the distal region. These \ndistal regions are enriched for glucocorticoid receptor response el -\nements. Furthermore, this 200 gene subset is responsible for the \nenrichment of GSEA signatures myeloid development (p-val<6E-15) \nand hematopoietic stemness inhibition (p-val<2E-16). Taken togeth -\ner, these results suggest that DEX has little effect in chromatin ac -\ncessibility and may regulate transcription on RA-mediated accessi -\nble regions during NB4 cell differentiation. \n41.

However, clin -\nically, it\u2019s difficult to define what stage the patient, or detect those \npatients with an advanced risk of progressing to severe sepsis. Our \naim was to investigate the usefulness of plasma peptidome finger -\nprints as instrument for stratification of patients with COVID-19 using \nMALDI-TOF technology. In this cut of the project, as a result of the \nmonitoring of 7 patients admitted to the Hospital de Cuenca Alta \nNestor Kirchner -July and September 2021- 46 plasma samples \nwere included. These were divided into hospitalization (H) (n = 27) \nand UCI (n = 19), classification used as severity proxy. Supervised \nanalyzes and machine learning algorithms were performed to dis -\ncriminate between the classification stages in patients. Also, clinical \nand biochemical parameters were also evaluated. Peripheral blood \nleukocytes count was increased in patients during stay UCI asso -\nciated to neutrophilia on the 5 day (Neutrophils/ml (median (IQR)): \nUCI=14027 (13892-18090) *; H=8954 (3998-10250); *p<0.05). Inflammation markers such as acute phase reactants showed an \nelevated ferritin (F) levels in UCI patients (F (ng/ml) (mean\u00b1SD): \nUCI=2300\u00b1173*; H=1216\u00b1556; *p<0.05). The 413 spectra dataset \nwas randomly partitioned into a training set (60%) and a test set \n(40%). Two ML classification methods were applied, Binary Discrimi -\nnant Analysis (BDA) and Random Forest (RF), using to 5, 10, 15 and \n20 peaks selected based on the ranking of the best predictors. Accu -\nracy (A), sensitivity (SE), and specificity (SP) were used to evaluate \nthe performances. The predictive value of models was for BDA (top \n10 peaks) A:78,5%, SE:81,8%, SP:75,0% and RF top (15 peaks) A: \n89.5% SE: 100.0% SP:85.7%. These results show the potential of \npeptidome fingerprints obtained by MALDI-TOF as a tool to develop \npredictive models that allow stratification patients according to the \ndisease severity. .\nBIOTECNOLOG\u00cdA FARMAC\u00c9UTICA\n42.

Additionally, numerous studies have  high -\nlighted these cytokines as candidates for the treatment of emerging  \nviral diseases such as Zika, Chikungunya or Dengue virus infec -\ntions.  Moreover, the pegylated forms of hIFN\u03b12a and hIFN\u03b12b have \nbeen  proposed as therapeutic alternatives to treat infections caused \nby the  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2). \nHowever, a major disadvantage of  hIFN-\u03b12b therapy is given by its \nshort plasma half-life resulting in the occurrence of severe side ef -\nfects. To optimize the cytokine\u2019s pharmacokinetic profile, our group \nhas developed a highly O-glycosylated IFN, GMOP-IFN, by fusing \nthe N-terminal end of the cytokine to a peptide containing four po -\ntential O-glycosilation sites.\nConsidering the significant number of reports existent about neu -\ntralizing antibodies (NAb) induction after repeated administrations of \nhIFN-\u03b1, and in order to develop a safer and more efficient IFN ther -\napy, in this study we applied the DeFT (De-immunization of Func -\ntional Therapeutics) approach to generate functional, de-immunized \nversions of GMOP-IFN.\nTwo variants out of four  displayed reduced ex vivo immunogenici -\nty, while preserving antiviral function. Moreover, both IFN analogs \nexhibited null specific antiproliferative activity, which constitutes an \nadditional highly favorable characteristic when considering the dra -\nmatic consequences associated to hematologic disorders common -\nly produced by hIFN-\u03b1 therapy.\nAltogether the results obtained in this work indicate that the new \nde-immunized GMOP- IFN variants are promising candidates for \nantiviral therapy, exhibiting reduced immunogenicity, proven in vitro \nantiviral activity while lacking antiproliferative activity.\n43.

The bacteria immobilized in nanofibers on the different substrates \nwere evidenced by electronic microscopy (SEM), chemical (ATR-\nFTIR) and thermal (TGA and DSC) analysis. The results obtained \nshow that the electrospinning technique is an innovative method to \ncoat feminine hygiene products with viable lactobacilli probiotics, in \na way to restore the vaginal tract.\n44.

Ar -\ngentina. \nProbiotic formulas for calf with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains must \ncontain high numbers of live microorganisms to exert the beneficial \neffect. Previously, our research group designed a formula in gela -\ntine capsules containing dry bacteria. However, LAB are nutrition -\nally exigent microorganisms, requiring complex culture media to \ngrow, which are very expensive, increasing the cost of production. \nThen, looking for cheaper culture media for industrial applications \nis of main importance. The objective of this work was to evaluate \ndifferent sugar combinations in a base media to reduce the cost of \nthe biomass obtention, growing the LAB at two temperatures. The \nprobiotic strains assayed were: Lactobacillus johnsonii  CRL1693, \nLigilactobacillus murinus  CRL1695, Limosilactobacillus mucosae  \nCRL1696 and Ligilactobacillus salivarius  CRL1702. 51 different me -\ndia were assayed with: Glucose (G), Fructose (F), Molasses (M), \nPectin (P), Lactose (L) and Corn syrup (CS). The growth was evalu -\nated by optical density (OD560nm) in microplates during 24 h at 30\u00b0C \nand 37\u00b0C, calculating growth parameters. CRL1693 showed signif -\nicant differences in the growth and Lag phase length (LPL) at the \ntwo temperatures. The better growth media resulted with G, L and \nCS; and M+G, L and F. CRL1696 grew in few culture media at both \ntemperatures: LPL and OD did not show significant differences, but \nwith lower growth rate at 30\u00b0C. The best combinations at 37\u00b0C were: \nL+G, P and CS. CRL1695 grew in most of the media designed at \nthe two temperatures showing no significant differences. CRL 1702 \ngrew in G, M and L, and in M+G, F in most of the media at the two \ntemperatures, with no significant differences in LPL, but with higher \ngrowth rate at 37\u00b0C. At 30\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, this strain showed good \ngrowth in G or M+G. The results indicate that the growth behaviour \nis dependent of each specific strain, eventhough all the evaluated \nLAB showed to grow in culture media designed with low-cost-sugar \nsources, as Molasses and Corn syrup for their scaling up for indus -\ntrial applications.  \n45.

There is an excellent attenuated virus vaccine for the preven -\ntion of this disease. However, this vaccine cannot be administered \nto immunocompromised and pregnant individuals. For this reason, \ndevelopment of new alternatives is of the utmost importance.  The \naim of this work was to generate a new generation vaccine candi -\ndate based on a recombinant baculovirus (rBV) that expresses YFV \nprotein E and NS1 on its surface capable of inducing both humor -\nal (protein E) and cellular (NS1) immune responses. To this end, \na pBacPak9 vector containing the BV GP64 signal peptide, YFV\u2019s \nprM, E, NS1 open reading frames and the ectodomain of VSV-G \nwas synthetically constructed. This plasmid and the bApGOZA bac -\nmid were co-transfected in High Five cells. Between 5 to 7 days \npost-transfection, characteristic BV infection signs (polyhedra and \ncytopathic effect) were observed. Culture supernatant was harvest -\ned and used to infect new cultures. When the aforementioned infec -\ntion signs firstly appeared in the subsequent infection, the superna -\ntant was again collected. This procedure was repeated 3 times. The \nrBV was recovered from the supernants and used to make a viral \nstock. Viral genome DNA extraction from the stock was subjected \nto PCR with specific primers to confirm the incorporation of the tar -\nget genes in the rBV genome. Protein expression was confirmed \nby western blot using an anti-E polyclonal antibody (GTX134024, \nGenetex) using another rBV carrying YFV prM-E genes as a positive \ncontrol. The stock was then escalated and concentrated by ultra -\ncentrifugation at 80.000g for 1:15 hs in a 25%w/w sucrose cushion \nand the pellet was resuspended in PBS and filtered using a 0.2\u00b5m \nfilter. This stock was titrated using the Sf9-GFP transgenic reporter \nline reaching 105.5 virus/ml.

Argentina.\nChronic high-fructose-fat diet (12 weeks) induces metabolic syn -\ndrome (MS), conducting to cardiovascular disease. Systolic blood \npressure (SBP) was measured in male rats (n=8-10/group) with \nMS, Iron overload (FE), or antioxidants -vitamins E, C and lipo -\nic-acid- (AoV), alone or with MS (MSFE, MSAoV). After decapita -\ntion, systolic and diastolic ventricular function in basal condition \nand in response to isoproterenol (10-9 M) (contractile and lusitropic \nreserve) were assayed in isolated perfused hearts. Left ventricular \ndeveloped pressure (LVDP), left ventricular end diastolic pressure \n(myocardial stiffness) and the relaxation half time (t1/2) were mea -\nsured. Data was analyzed by Two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-\ntest (p\u22640.05). The SBP rose in MS   at 4 (p<0.005), 8 and 12 weeks \n(p<0.0001) vs basal levels (BL). These increases were not seen \nwhen MS received AoV. In rats with control diet (CD), FE rose SBP \nfrom week 4 (p<0.0001) vs BL, maintaining this increase in weeks \n8 and 12 (p<0.0001). In MSFE rats SBP was increased vs BL at 8 \n(p<0.0001) and 12 (p<0.0002) weeks. Respect to CD, MS increase \nSBP at 4 (p<0.0047), 8 (p<0.0001) and 12 (p<0.025) week. AoV pre -\nvents SBP rise caused by MS from week 8 (p<0.020). FE increased \nSBP in 4 (p<0.0021), 8 (p<0.0009) and 12 (p<0.0008) week vs CD. ABSTRACTS93\nMSFE rose SBP vs CD in week 8 (p<0.0001). No differences were \nobserved between SMFE and FE at all times. Basal ventricular func -\ntion did not change between CD and treated groups.  Contractile re -\nserve was attenuated in MS and MSFE (p<0.05) vs CD. Ventricular \nrelaxation rate was lower in MS, MSFE and MSAoV in response to \nisoproterenol. Conclusion: MS and FE load alone or in the presence \nof MS alter the cardiovascular system, inducing a rise in SBP and an \nimpaired ventricular function, evidenced by contractile reserve and \nventricular relaxation. AoV counteracts some of these effects, sug -\ngesting that proinflammatory condition as FE overload or SM induce \ncardiovascular damage that can be reverted by AoV.\n47. (025) ASSESSMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY \nIN MEDIUM PRESSURE HYPERBARIC OXYGENATION \nTHERAPY\nChristopher Gutierrez, Guillermo Di Girolamo, Roc\u00edo Castilla \nand Patricia Bonazzola\nInstituto Dr. Alberto Taquini de Investigaciones en Medicina \nTraslacional (IATIMET) UBA-CONICET\nThe \u201chyperbaric oxygenation therapy\u201d (HBOT) is currently used \nas an adjunct therapy in many pathologies. Its therapeutic action \nis based on that hyperoxia at high pressure (2.4 atm) induces va -\nsoconstriction and reduction of inflammation among others effects.\nRecently, a more accessible Medium Pressure Hyperbaric Oxygen -\nation therapy\u201d (mHBOT) at 1.4 atm is also used as therapy that re -\nsulted equally effective at a lower cost. \nHowever, up to date no studies have been carried out to support the \ncardiovascular safety of both treatments. For this reason, we studied \nthe cardiovascular safety of mHBOT in rats subjected to a protocol \nequivalent to that applied in humans.\nMale Sprague Dawley rats were submitted to 30 sessions of 60 min \nin a hypebaric chamber at 1.44 atm. and 100% O2. Isolated hearts \nwere perfused through aorta at 37\u00baC, paced at 3 Hz, and exposed \nto 30 min ischemia (I) followed by 45 min reperfusion (R). Simulta -\nneous mechanical and heat measurements and the heart damaged \narea (trifeniltetrazolium) were evaluated.\nAlso aorta rings were superfused and the noradrenaline response \nwas analyzed.\nHearts from mHBOT-treated rats showed an increase in resting \npressure (RP) during ischemia (p<0.05) but no changes were ob -\nserved in R.\nAn improvement (p<0.05) in post ischemic contractile recovery was \nobserved in hearts from mHBOT-treated rats (65.4\u00b112.9%) respect \nto control ones (33.5\u00b16.1%) at 45 min R. \nmHBOT did not alter total heat rate (Ht), but an increase (p<0.05) \nin contractile economy during R (120.9\u00b120%) respect to control \n(53.2\u00b18.9%) at 45 min was observed. Also mHBOT reduced the \nheart damage area induced by I/R.\nFurthermore, arteries from mHBOT-treated rats showed similar re -\nsponse to noradrenaline than controls.\nConclusion: the mHBOT cardioprotects hearts from I/R injury acting \nas a preconditioning agent. The use of this therapy is safety for the \ncardiovascular system.\n48.

In this work, we aimed to elucidate mi -\ntochondrial dynamics (fusion, fission, biogenesis and mitophagy) \nas a fundamental effector of cardiac tissue energy management in an experimental model of endotoxemia. Female Sprague-Dawley \nrats were subjected to low-grade endotoxemia (ip injection of LPS \n0.5 mg kg -1 body weight) and severe endotoxemia (ip injection of \nLPS 8 mg kg -1 body weight) for 6 or 24 h. TEM analysis after 6 h \nlow-grade endotoxemia showed higher number of mitochondria per \ncardiac tissue area and a shorter diameter. Also, structures com -\npatible with damaged mitochondria were observed. In severe endo -\ntoxemia, highly damaged mitochondrial structures were observed, \nbeing these results associated with a 20% decrease in mitochondrial \ninner membrane potential, suggesting organelle dysfunction. Based \non these results, expression of the main proteins involved in mito -\nchondrial processes of fusion (OPA-1), fission (DRP-1), biogenesis \n(PGC-1\u0251 and mtTFA) and mitophagy (Pink-1 and Parkin), were stud -\nied. Low-grade endotoxemia exhibited a decrease in DRP-1 expres -\nsion levels whereas Pink-1 expression was increased, both at 24 \nh treatment. Severe endotoxemia showed increases in OPA-1 and \nPink-1 expression after 6 h treatment. The observed results suggest \nthat the severity of endotoxemia relates to the degree of mitochon -\ndrial dysfunction and structural damage, and is linked to changes in \nmitochondrial dynamics as repairing processes. Our work presents \nnovel results that contribute to elucidate the mechanisms by which \nendotoxemia, energy management, and mitochondrial architecture \ninteract in cardiac tissue, arising this triade as a target to base fu -\nture therapeutics for preserving this organ from inflammatory and \noxidative damage.\n49.

Females did not show significant heart alterations. \nObjective: Evaluate cardiac renin angiotensin system in adult rats \nexposed to zinc deficiency during growth.\nMethods: Female Wistar rats fed either control (C30ppm) or low \nzinc (L8ppm) diets from pregnancy to offspring weaning. C male \nand female offspring continued with control diet (Ccm;Ccf respec -\ntively), whereas L male and female offspring fed control (Lcm;Lcf) \nor low zinc (Llm;Llh) diets. At day 81 we measured in left ventricle: \nAngiotensin (Ang) II, Ang(1-7) levels by radioimmunoassay, Angio -\ntensin converting enzyme 1(ECA1),ECA2 and AT1 receptor (AT1R) \nexpression by RT-qPCR; AT2R and AT1R expression by western \nblot and immunohistochemistry.

No changes were observed in Ang(1-7) content and ACE \nexpression. \nConclusions: Zinc restriction during prenatal and postnatal growth \nexacerbated the cardiac Ang II-AT1R axis in adult male  rats. An \nadequate zinc diet during postnatal life could not reverse these  ef-MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 202194\nfects. This would contribute to morphological and functional cardiac \nalterations. Females showed higher protected status. These data  \nstrengthen the importance of diet optimization to prevent cardiac \ndiseases.\n50. (212) THE BISPHOSPHONATE ALENDRONATE EXERTS \nA PROTECTIVE ACTION ON VASCULAR RESPONSE IN -\nDUCED BY STRESS CONDITIONS.\nPablo Hernan Cutini, Virginia Massheimer\nINBIOSUR, Universidad Nacional del Sur (UNS), CONICET, \nDepartamento de Biolog\u00eda, Bioqu\u00edmica y Farmacia, Bah\u00eda \nBlanca, Argentina.\nDuring menopause, women exhibits high prevalence of cardiovas -\ncular and bone diseases. Bisphosphonates (BP) represent one of \nfirst-line drugs mainly applied for postmenopausal osteoporosis \ntreatment. The aim of this work was to investigate the action of the \nBP alendronate (ALN) on vascular response to extracellular stress, \nfocusing our attention on alterations in cell proliferation and migra -\ntion patterns and, on the ability to remodel by angiogenesis. Primary \ncultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and endothelial \ncells (EC) isolated from murine aorta were used. In order to induce \nstress conditions, cells were incubated in a pro-osteogenic medi -\num (OM) or exposed to the pro-inflammatory agent LPS. Using the \nMTT assay, we showed that 1 \u03bcM ALN completely or partially sup -\npressed VSMC proliferation induced by LPS (31%, p<0.02) or OM \n(108%, p<0.001), respectively. Employing wound healing assay, we \nfound that the BP exhibited similar cell migration pattern than control \ngroup, meanwhile the stressors enhanced cell motility (20%; 25%, \nLPS; MO, respectively, p<0.02). The presence of ALN reversed the \nstimulation of cell migration induced by LPS or OM. Tube formation \nassay was used to assess angiogenesis. Total length of the tubes \ngenerated from EC seeded on fibrin matrix was quantified. We found \nthat, 1 \u03bcM ALN stimulated new capillaries formation (30%, p<0.05) \nin a VEGF dependent manner, since the presence of the VEGF re -\nceptor antagonist SU5416, completely abrogated the angiogenic \nstimulus of the BP. Under stress conditions (LPS or MO), the proan -\ngiogenic action elicited by ALN was not affected. We also demon -\nstrated that ALN increases VEGF synthesis by EC (36% vs control, \np<0.05, ELISA test). In conclusion, the evidence presented suggest \nthat, besides its main action of bone remodeling, ALN could display \na protective effect on vascular homeostasis promoting angiogenesis \nand preserving cell growth and motility, when blood vessels are ex -\nposed to environmental stress.\n51.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the main \nmetabolite effective in redox sensing, signaling and regulation, has \nbeen described as an insulinomimetic agent. While physiological \nH2O2 steady-state concentrations ([H2O2]ss) are ~1\u201310 nM, higher \n[H2O2]ss lead to adaptive stress responses, and supraphysiological \n[H2O2]ss (>100 nM) result in oxidative distress. \nAim: To study heart mitochondrial H2O2 metabolism in an early stage \nof type 1 diabetes. \nMethods: Diabetes was induced by Streptozotocin (single dose, 60 \nmg/kg, ip) in male rats (glycemia at 72 h: 130 \u00b1 5 (C); 415 \u00b1 23 (DM) \nmg/dl) and animals were sacrificed at day 10. The hearts were re -\nmoved and mitochondrial function, H2O2 metabolism, and lipid per -\noxidation were evaluated.\nResults: State 3 respiration sustained by malate+glutamate (23%) and complex I activity (17%) were reduced in DM rats. Neither the \nmembrane potential nor ATP production were different between \ngroups. Mitochondrial H2O2 production was 117% higher in DM rats, \nand this increase was accompanied by the enhancement in the H2O2 \ndetoxification enzymes activities and expressions: catalase (200% \nand 233%) and glutathione peroxidase (26% and 42%), leading to \n[H2O2]ss ~50 nM. Although [GSSG+GSH]mitochondrial was lower in dia -\nbetic rats, there was no difference in GSH/GSSG. Mitochondrial lipid \nperoxidation, evaluated from 4-HNE expression, was 45% higher in \nDM than in C animals.\nConclusions: The maintenance of mitochondrial membrane po -\ntential, ATP generation and GSH/GSSG suggest the absence of \nirreversible damage at this early stage of DM 1. The increase in \nmitochondrial [H2O2]ss above the physiological range, but still below \n100 nM seems to be part of the adaptive response triggered in car -\ndiomyocytes due to the absence of insulin. \n52.

Thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) maintains the cellular \nredox status and decreases the infarct size in I/R injury. However, \nit is not fully understood its role in exercise mice. The aim was to \nstudy if Trx1is involved in the exercise cardioprotection mechanism. \nWild type mice hearts (Wt), transgenic mice hearts overexpressing \nTrx1, and a dominant negative mutant (DN) of Trx1 were used, mice \nwere divided in exercise group (E) and sedentary group (S). Mice \nwere placed in cages fitted with running wheels during 4weeks. After \nthe exercise-training period, mice hearts were subjected to 30min \nof I and 120min of R (Langendorff technique). The assessment of \nthe infarct size was performed using TTC. Also, heart rate variation \n(\u2206HR%) and mice, heart, and soleus weight was measured. Trans -\nverse muscle sections of soleus muscles were stained with H&E and \nthe cross-sectional area (CSA) of myofibers were measure. Data \nwere expressed as mean\u00b1SEM and p<0.05 was considered statisti -\ncally significant. n= 4 each group.\nTraining was confirmed by HR variation. The change in body \nweight at the fourth week of training in transgenic mice was com -\nparable with Wt mice. Soleus weight showed similar values in S \ngroups (Wt:0.42mg/mm\u00b10.01; Trx1:0.44mg/mm\u00b10.04; DN:0.40mg/\nmm\u00b10.02), but there was a tendency to increase in E groups (Wt: \n0,62mg/mm\u00b10,03; Trx1:0.51mg/mm\u00b10.03; DN:0.53mg/mm\u00b10.04). \nThose results were confirmed by H&E that showed a preliminary \nincreased in CSA in the E groups compare with S groups. Trx1 over -\nexpression reduces infarct size (27.4%\u00b12.2 vs Wt:54.1%\u00b13.2) but \nthis cardioprotection is lost in DN (50.2%\u00b14.0). However, voluntary \nexercise manages to reduce the infarct size in Wt (26.0%\u00b12.9 vs \nS-Wt) mice, without showing changes in the Trx1 (26.2%\u00b13.9) and \nDN mice (45.7%\u00b16.9). In conclusion, we found that Trx1 could be \ninvolved in the cardioprotection mediated by exercise.\n53.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncR -\nNAs) and mRNA modifications, in particular N-6-methyladenosine \n(m6A), regulate several physiological and pathological processes, \nbut little is known about these molecules in SMC biology.  Our aim \nwas to study both the role of lncRNAs and the m6A machinery \nduring SMC differentiation. By using an in vitro model of primary \nhuman pulmonary artery SMCs phenotypic modulation and RNA \ndeep sequencing we found several regulated lncRNAs. RT-qPCR \nand Northern blot confirmed the dramatically increase of a candi -\ndate during differentiation, which we refer to as Differentiation And \nGrowth Arrest Related (DAGAR). DAGAR was downregulated in \nSMCs during tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced de-differentiation \nand in total RNA from pulmonary arteries of patients with COPD \ncompared to non-smoker patients. DAGAR Knockdown by siPools \nled to differentiation defects and increased SMC proliferation. \nRNA-Protein affinity purification identified the m6A machinery bound \nto DAGAR. Interestingly, DAGAR was enriched in m6A-RNA immu -\nnoprecipitation. Accordingly, we found a marked downregulation of \nYTHDF proteins during SMC differentiation, which is consistent with \nDAGAR increase. YTHDF2 immunoprecipitation followed by RNA \ndeep sequencing displayed an enrichment of mRNAs associated \nto SMC fundamental processes, including smooth muscle myosin \nheavy chain (MYH11), the most specific SMC marker, and members \nof the TGF b, PDGF and VEGF pathways. Remarkably, knockdown \nof YTHDF2 by siPools induced a significant increase of DAGAR and \nSMC marker gene expression. We conclude that the lncRNA DA -\nGAR and the m6A reader YTHDF2 contribute to the regulation of \nSMC plasticity and differentiation programs. \n54.

Our previous studies showed that \npregnant Stroke-prone Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHRSP) \ndevelop a SPE phenotype, associated with exaggerate activation \nof placental oxidative stress pathways. The present study aimed to \nevaluate the therapeutic potential of lipoic acid (LA), a potent anti -\noxidant, in this model.  \nMethods: We established timed syngeneic pregnancies using SHR -\nSP and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) females (8-10 weeks old, N=10 animals/\nday), with vaginal plug detection denoted as gestation day (GD)1. \nDams were assigned to four groups: LA-treated WKY / SHRSP, in -\njected 25mg/kg BW LA i.p. on GD1, GD8 and GD12 and control \nWKY / SHRSP, injected saline with the same protocol. Systolic blood \npressure (SBP) profiles were determined using a tail-cuff device. \nFollowing collection of blood and 24h urine samples, animals were \neuthanized and implantation sites isolated for morphological analy -\nses. Fetal and placental weights were recorded on GD20. Statistical \nanalyses were run with ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc tests, using \nPrism v 8.0. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. \nResults: LA treatment prevented the pregnancy-dependent SBP increase in SHRSP and decreased significantly maternal protein -\nuria on GD18. Furthermore, LA significantly increased SHRSP fetal \nweights and ameliorated the asymmetric growth restriction phe -\nnotype, as demonstrated by the decreased cephalization indexes \nobserved on GD20.  The placental phenotype was also improved \nin LA-treated SHRSP, displaying increased numbers of glycogen \ntrophoblasts in the junctional zone on GD14 together with increased \nplacental weights on GD20. \nConclusion: LA treatment prevented development of the maternal \nsyndrome and ameliorated placental function and fetal growth, \nemerging as a novel tool for prevention of SPE in pregnancies af -\nfected by chronic hypertension.\n55.

QU\u00cdMICAS-UNC. CIBICI-CONICET. \nChagas disease (CD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi , affects 6 \nmillion people worldwide. Recently, increased aortic stiffness (IAS) \nin CD patients classified as indeterminate without cardiac compli -\ncations was observed by sensitive imaging. IAS is a predictor of \ncardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Smooth muscle cells (SMC) \nphenotypic alteration during vascular injury is associated with re -\nduced elasticity, impaired distensibility, fibrosis, and IAS. The aim \nof this work was to evaluate SMC alterations associated with IAS \nduring T. cruzi  infection. Thoracic (Thor), abdominal aorta (Abd), \nand brachiocephalic artery (BCA) were obtained from both control \nnon-infected (NI), and acute  T. cruzi  infected BALB/c mice (INF). \nRT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, and FACS revealed alterations \nrelated to SMC phenotypic switch from a contractile to a synthetic \nstate in arteries of INF mice, with loss of SMC markers expression \nsuch as \u03b1-SMA, calponin, transgelin, and Myh11. In addition, we \nfound increased expression of klf4, Ki67, and \u03b2-catenin which are \nassociated with SMC and macrophage (Mo) proliferation. Recently, \nit has been demonstrated that SMC can transdifferentiate into Mo-\nlike cells. Mo functional phenotype in aortic segments was principal -\nly M2-resident- like CD206+Arg-1+, despite T. cruzi  presence. Only \nMo in inflammatory foci close to vasa vasorum of Thor from INF \nmice were CD206+iNOS+ . We used \u03b1-SMA+ and F4/80+CD11b+ \nas SMC and Mo populations, respectively. We found \u03b1-SMA+ cells \nF4/80+CD11b+, and viseversa , only in arteries from INF group. Us -\ning confocal microscopy, we found cells co-expressing \u03b1-SMA+ and \nthe Mo marker CD68 in the media, and in the adventitia of INF mice. \nOur findings suggest that the infection induces SMC dedifferenti -\nation and transdifferentiation associated with IAS promotion. This \nknowledge is important to review the integration of indeterminate \nCD patients on the risk list and comorbidities of CVD, and promote \neither preventive or therapeutic strategies.\n56.

The complex system morphology of blood vessels \ncould be studied by mathematical algorithms to obtain fractal pa -\nrameters: Fractal Dimension (FD) and predictive determination co -\nefficient (R\u00b2) which would indicate the irregular distribution of the \nvessels in space and their adaptation ability and interaction with the \nenvironment, respectively. The aim of this work was to analyze the \nencephalic carotid arterial system anatomy behavior through Higuchi \nAlgorithm (HA) in patients with neurovascular diseases for prognos -\ntic purposes. Observational, cross sectional and descriptive study. \nMiddle Cerebral (MCA), Anterior Cerebral (ACA) and Internal Carot -\nid (ICA) arteries were analyzed in 75 angio-CT images of patients \nwith diagnosed neurovascular pathology, mean age 36.25 years old \n\u00b1 15.95, 67% women and 33% men, chosen randomly. COREL -\nDraw, Phillips DICOM Viewer 3.0, Frakout! and Excel spreadsheet \nwere using for HA application. FD and R\u00b2 were determined, values \nbelow 0.8 would indicate loss of fractal properties. The results were \nexpressed as median (M) and standard deviation (\u00b1). Pearson\u2019s \ncorrelation coefficient (r) was obtained between FD and R\u00b2 estab -\nlished by arterial vessels studied. Results: FD (MCA): M=0.5\u00b10.33, \nR\u00b2 (MCA): M=0.88\u00b10.18; FD (ACA): M=0.38\u00b10.23, R\u00b2 (ACA): \nM=0.76\u00b10.28; FD (ICA): M=0.32\u00b10.25, R\u00b2 (ICA): M=0.64\u00b10.29.

Ambient hypoxia acts as an environmental \nstressor eliciting breathing  adaptations that may be altered by the \nEtOH exposure. However,  the specific effects induce by chronic, \nacute or the combination  of them EtOH intoxication are not clearly \nunderstood. In an  animal model equivalent to the 3rd human ges -\ntational trimester, breathing  frequencies and apneas were recorded \nagainst an intermittent hypoxic experience  as a function of EtOH \npre-exposure and/or acute EtOH intoxication.  Pups pre-exposed to \n0.0 or 2.0g/kg of EtOH (DPs 3-5-7,  ig) were evaluated at DP9 in \nsobriety-0.0g/kg- or under the  state of EtOH intoxication-2.0g/kg-. \nBreathing rates and apneas were recorded  through whole body \nplexismography during 35 minutes [5 min of  initial normoxia, fol -\nlowed by 3 episodes of hypoxia (O2 8%) of 5 min,  separated by \nperiods of recovery-normoxia of the same duration].\nFirst acute  EtOH intoxication diminished the hypoxic ventilatory \nresponse (HVR) during the  test (p=0.034) relative to it expressed \nin pups never intoxicated.  The prior experience with the drug sig -\nnificantly modified the HVR patterns, as follow: in sobriety, EtOH \npre-exposed pups exhibited a depressed HVR relative to vehicle \npre-exposed pups. On the contrary, under the state of intoxication, \nEtOH pre-exposed pups elicited an exacerbated HVR when were \ndefied by hypoxia respect to vehicle pre-exposed pups. With regard \nto apneas, an increase in the number of apneas was triggered by \nboth, the first acute EtOH intoxication or by the history with the drug \nin sober pups (p= 0.017). In summary, specific HVR alterations and \napneic episodes occurrence were observed in neonates depending \non the type of EtOH exposure received (acute or chronic). These re -\nsults emphasize the complexity of the disruptive EtOH effects upon \nbreathing at this early and critical stage of development.\nFunding: PICT 2016-0144/SECyT-UNC-CONSOLIDAR, Dra.

In order to study this process of dis -\nease development, we aimed to generate a human in vitro  model of \nembryonic pituitary as a robust tool for functional testing of genetic \nvariants found in MPHD patients. We hypothesized that combining \ndifferent stimuli and differentiation protocols in vitro [1], [2], it is pos -\nsible to induce fully differentiated hormone-pituitary cells from hu -\nman induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We cultured the iPSCs \nin the presence of signaling factors involved in pituitary development \nincluding Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4), the Smoothened \nAgonist activator of Sonic Hedgehog pathway (SAG), and Fibroblast \nGrowth Factor 2 (FGF2), for 15 days. During the entire protocol, cell \nmorphology was observed and registered under the microscope, \nand cellular extracts corresponding to days 0, 4, 7, and 15 of the \nprotocol were collected to assess gene expression by qRT-PCR. We \nobserved an increase in the expression of representative markers \nof pituitary differentiation ( PITX2, SIX1, HESX1, OTX2 ) and a de -\ncrease in the expression of pluripotency markers ( NANOG, OCT4 ) \nover the days of treatment compared to control iPSCs (cultured with \nmedia only), suggesting that the protocols were effective in their cell \nspecification. An interesting finding was the increase in mRNA lev -\nels of FOXA2  at days 7 and 15 of the protocol, a novel gene in the \netiology of MPHD, poorly characterized in human pituitary develop -\nment and found mutated in one case of MPHD from our Argentinean \ncohort [3]. This study establishes a new approach to study protein\u2019s \nrole in pituitary progenitor cell regulation and offers new candidate \ngenes for MPHD that remain unexplained. \nReferences: [1] B.

(005) INFLUENCE OF PRENATAL AND NEONATAL EXPO -\nSURE TO PHTHLATE ON THE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR AND \nACTIVITY OF MALE RATS.\nBilbao R., Scacchi P., Cutrera R., Modarelli MF., Reyes Toso \nC., Ponzo OJ.\nEndocrinology Laboratory. Institute of Physiology. Academic \nUnit 2, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine. UBA.\nThe endocrine disruptor phthalate (DEHP) has estrogenic and / \nor anti-androgenic activity. We have previously demonstrated its \nanxiogenic action in male rats dependent on the androgenic level. \nObjective:  to evaluate the effect of DEHP on sexual behavior pa -\nrameters in adult male rats. Materials and Methods:  Male rats were \nexposed to DEHP (n=14) during their intrauterine development and \nlactation at a dose of 30 mg/kg/d administered in drinking water to \nthe mothers. Controls (C) only received the vehicle (n=13). Between \n150 and 180 days of age, the sexual behavior tests were carried out ABSTRACTS97\nby placing a sexually virgin male with a young female castrated with \nestrogen and progestational replacement in a transparent plastic \ncage, under controlled environment temperature and red light be -\nlow 20 lux. Continuous filming and recording (BORIS program) were \nperformed during 30 minutes at night (20 PM to 05 AM), to evalu -\nate number of mounts (NM), number of intromission (NI), number of \nejaculations (NE), mounting latency (LM), intromission latency (LI), \nejaculatory latency (LE). A significance of p<0.05 was considered. \nResults:  The total NM did not differ between DHEP and C groups. \nThe NI was lower in DEHP compared to C (C: 26.92 \u00b1 0.5 vs DHEP: \n25.21 \u00b1 0.5) (p<0.025). The NE was lower in DEHP compared to C \n(C: 1.769 \u00b1 0.12 vs DHEP: 1.071 \u00b1 0.07) (p<0.0001). The LM was \nslower in DEHP compared to C (C: 55.32 \u00b1 2.0 vs DHEP: 96.30 \u00b1 \n9.0 seconds) (p<0.001). The LI was slower in DEHP compared to C \n(C: 55.32 \u00b1 2.0 vs DHEP: 98.36 \u00b1 8.9 seconds) (p<0.0006). LE was \nslower in DEHP compared to C (C: 823.6 \u00b1 23.5 vs DHEP: 1010.0 \u00b1 \n42.25 seconds) (p<0.0009). Conclusion:  Exposure to DEHP during \nthe early period of development leads to a modification of sexual \nbehavior in males during their adulthood, evidenced in a delay in the \nonset of sexual activity and ejaculation time and less sexual activity.\n60. (007) ACTION OF NITRATES PRESENT IN GROUNDWA -\nTER WATER ON THE EXPRESSION OF THE NIS TRANS -\nPORTER DURING THE METAMORPHOSIS OF XENOPUS \nLAEVIS.\nModarelli MF, Bilbao R, Scacchi P, Ponzo OJ.\nEndocrinology Laboratory. Institute of Physiology. Academic \nUnit 2, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine. UBA.\nThe exposure of amphibians during their larval stage to thyroid dis -\nruptors such as nitrates, produces body morphological changes de -\npendent on thyroid hormone and also thyroid histological alterations. \nObjectives:  to evaluate the thyroid disrupting action of nitrates on \nthe expression of the cotransporter NIS. Materials and method : \nXenopus Laevis larvae (T: 22 \u00b1 2\u00baC, pH: 7 to 7.8 and light-dark cy -\ncle: 12-12hs) immersed in water from: a) filtered net: Control (C)  \n(n=6), b) underground water with a nitrate concentration of 83 mg/l \n(INTI): Exposed (E)  (n=6) and c) filtered network plus 0.007mg/l \nof potassium perchlorate: Positive Control (CP)  (n=6). Results:  \nDuring the 58NF and 60NF metamorphosis stages, it was observed \nthat the level of NIS expression is higher in decreasing order in \nE>CP>C (p<0.05). The values   recorded for the means measured in \noptical density, in stage 58NF were: (C) 680.7 \u00b1 196.9, (E) 1251.2 \n\u00b1 702.9, (CP) 1059 \u00b1 592.8 and in stage 60NF: (C) 1298.3 \u00b1 195.1, \n(E) 1794.5 \u00b1 629.1, (CP) 1420.2 \u00b1 1118.7. However, in stage 62NF, \na decrease in the expression levels of the NIS transporter was ob -\nserved, being greater in decreasing order in C>CP>E (p<0.05), ob -\nserving that in some animals it stopped expressing itself. The values   \nrecorded for the means measured in optical density were for this \nstage: (C) 1495.8 \u00b1 1016.9, (E) 49.3 \u00b1 26.2, (CP) 129.9 \u00b1 93.1. Con-\nclusion:  during the metamorphosis of amphibians exposed to the \ne ndocrine disrupting action of nitrates transported by groundwater, \nthe expression of the NIS transporter is quantitatively affected in \ncritical stages of metamorphosis such as prometamorphosis and \nclimax. This being a possible compensation mechanism triggered \nby the alteration of the correct metamorphosis process caused by \nhypothyroximemia, which generates the interference exerted by ni -\ntrates in the uptake of iodine in the larvae. \n61. (009) DIFFERENCES IN SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT (DSD) \nAND PRENATAL GROWTH. ANALYSIS OF THE PREV -\nALENCE OF BEING BORN SMALL FOR GESTATIONAL \nAGE (SGA) AND ITS CORRELATION WITH BIOCHEMI -\nCAL AND PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERIZATION (IN 46 XY, \nDSD)\nMattone MC, Costanzo M. Hidalgo L, Berger M,  Marino R, \nTouzon S, Perez Garrido N, Ramirez P, Berensztein E, Ciac -\ncio M, Belgorosky A, Guercio G.  \nContext: DSD are a group of rare and heterogeneous congenital \nconditions in which the development of chromosomal, gonadal, or \nanatomic sex is atypical. Specific molecular diagnosis is identified in \nonly about 40-50% of cases. Associated conditions, specially being born SGA, have been reported with a higher prevalence than ex -\npected for general population.  The relationship between the pres -\nence of genital abnormalities and intrauterine growth restriction is \nunknown.\nObjective: to analyze the prevalence of being born SGA in a cohort \nof DSD patients evaluated in a single tertiary pediatric center be -\ntween 2000-2021, and its relationship with    karyotype, molecular \ndiagnosis, and clinical phenotype. \nMethods:   DSD patients were classified according to karyotype. Ex -\nternal genital score (EGS), gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), \nlength (BL), and molecular diagnosis were evaluated. BW and/or BL \nstandard deviation scores were calculated according to gestational \nage (Intergrowth21).\nResults: A total of 556 DSD patients were available: 187 (33%) DSD \n46,XY, 207 (37%) DSD 46,XX,  and 162 (29%) chromosomal DSD. \nMolecular diagnosis was achieved in 64% (258/403) of 46,XY and \n46,XX DSD patients. SGA was found in 25.4% of DSD 46,XY with \na higher frequency in those without molecular diagnosis, and with \napparently normal testicular function (Fisher test p <0.05).  EGS did \nnot correlate neither with GA nor BW (p ns).  \nConclusions:  The frequency of being born SGA in 46,XY DSD pa -\ntients without  molecular diagnosis and  with no specific disorders \nof undermasculinization was higher than reported in Latin-American \npopulation (9%).  Factors involved in early embryonic growth and \ndevelopment, and in gonadal differentiation, could mediate the as -\nsociation between being born SGA and DSD in humans. Further \nstudies to clarify etiological diagnosis are needed.\n62.

Peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cells (PBMC) are a source \nof molecular biomarkers reflecting metabolic status. \nObjective : to search associations between anthropometric and glu -\ncose homeostasis variables, including insulin receptor (InsR) gene \nexpression in PBMC, in mothers with pregestational normal-weight \n(NW, n=31) and overweight/obesity (OW/OB, n=31) at 10 days post -\npartum and their children at 6 months of age.\nFindings : glucose, insulin, HOMA index and milk insulin did not differ \nbetween NW and OW/OB mothers. InsR gene expression was low -\ner in OW/OB mothers and negatively correlated with pregestational \nbody mass index (BMI) (r=-0.51, p=0.011) and with children zBMI \nat 10d (r=-0.40, p=0.049). Anthropometric variables, insulin and \nInsR did not differ between children from NW or OW/OB mothers. In \nmothers and children, InsR negatively correlated with adiposity (r=-\n0.69, p<0.001 and r=-0.74, p=0.009, respectively), whereas insulin \npositively correlated with adiposity (r=0.35, p=0.006 and r=0.59, \np=0.016, respectively).\nConclusions : In the early postpartum, InsR gene expression in \nPBMC is a sensitive biomarker of glucose metabolism in mothers \nwith OW/OB without insulin resistance. Adiposity correlated moder -\nately with plasma insulin and strongly with InsR. PBMC are useful \nfor early detection of metabolic disorders.\n63.

However, a  hormone replacement  \ndoes  not restore tumor growth suggesting the participation of oth -\ner ovarian factors. Pituitary activins inhibit lactotroph function, and \nactivin expression  is reduced in prolactinomas. We demonstrated \nthat  the loss of  gonadal inhibins after OVX improves pituitary activ -\nin expression, it could be involved in  the inhibition of prolactinoma \ngrowth. In the present work, we analyzed if the OVX also recover \nactivin receptor expression and biological function in lactotrophs. \nWe used female mice overexpressing the \u03b2 subunit of the human \nchorionic gonadotrophin (hCG\u03b2+) as a model of prolactinoma.\nOur results show that the expression of activins, activin-receptors \n(ActRIIA, ActRIIB, Acvr1B by RTqPCR), and pp38 (double IHC, as \na signal of activin biological activity in lactotrophs) are decreased in \nprolactinomas from hCG\u03b2+ females, concomitant with an increase \nin Pit1 expression. But  surprisingly the protein expression (IHC) of \nactivin receptors, did not  decrease in prolactinomas. We observed \nhigh expression in lactotrophs from  transgenic females but mainly \nin the cytoplasm, contrary to the  plasma membrane localization in \nlactotrophs from wt pituitaries. A prepuberal  OVX prevented all these \nalterations in the pituitary activin system,  even changes in receptors \nlocalization.\nWe conclude that the decrease in pituitary activin expression and \nbiological activity found in hCG\u03b2+  female pituitaries is involved in \nprolactinoma development. The loss of gonadal inhibins after an \nOVX recovers activin inhibitory function on lactotrophs preventing \nprolactinoma growth. Alterations in receptor localization could in -\nvolve specific proteins (ARIPs) which interact with activin receptors \ntype II and down-regulate their activity by controlling mechanisms of \nendocytosis (study in progress).\n64.

Nevertheless, a subset (~20%) became resis -\ntant to the treatment and require extirpation. The molecular mech -\nanisms underlying the escape from dopamine inhibition include \nalterations in D2R signalling. It has been reported that bradykinin B2 \nreceptor (B2R) is highly expressed in human prolactinomas and can \nheteromerize with D2R, abolishing Gi signalling of D2R. In the pres -\nent study, we proposed to assess 1-the physical and 2- the func -\ntional interaction of D2R-B2R, and 3- to determine whether those \nreceptors interact in human pituitary adenomas.  1- By using the \nNanoBiT protein-protein interaction assay (NB-assay): 1a- we val -\nidated the formation of BR2-D2R measuring NanoLuciferase (NL) \nactivity in HEK293T cell line transiently transfected with human D2R \nand B2R fused to one of the two inactive fragments of the split NL. 1b- we studied the coupling of B2R to G proteins in cells transient -\nly transfected with B2R and Gi, Gs, G12/13 or Gq, fused to inactive \nfragments of the split NL. We found that B2R recruits Gq and Gi af-\nter stimulation with B2R specific agonist. 2- We measured the Ca2+ \nmobilization by Fluo4-NW Assay in HEK293T transiently transfected \nwith B2R alone or in combination with D2R. B2R agonist (100nM) \nincreased intracellular Ca2+ in cells expressing B2R alone or B2R-\nD2R. D2R agonist or antagonist did not alter B2R signal suggesting \nthat the coupling of protein Gq to B2R is not altered in the B2R-D2R \nheteromer. 3- B2R-D2R interaction was measured in membrane ex -\ntracts of human pituitary adenomas by AlphaLisa assay. We found \nB2R-D2R complexes in prolactinomas and non-secreting tumours, \nbut not in mixed tumours (GH+PRL). We hypothesized that D2R-\nB2R dimerization is increased in prolactinomas, disturbing D2R \nsignalling by prevailing the D2R-B2R coupling to Gq, promoting re -\nsistance to D2R agonists in patients with resistant prolactinomas. \n65.

Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias de la Salud (INIC -\nSA-CONICET).\nFilamin A (FLNA) is a promiscuous protein, with a multiplicity of func -\ntions, being its canonical role an acting binding protein which is re -\nlated to cytoskeleton rearrangement, but also having non canonical \nroles as a scaffold protein related to signal transduction or exerting \ngene expression regulation.\nThe role of FLNA expression and function in tumours is described \nas dual, having found to promote or inhibited tumour progression in \na tissue and subcellular localization dependent manner. Despite the \nprogress being made in the past years, FLNA impact in prolactin-se -\ncreting pituitary tumours remains elusive, possibly due to the variety \nof factors that modulate its final action.\nThis work aims to determine the impact of FLNA expression levels \nin global cellular processes in the tumoral somatolactotropic cell line \nGH3.\nTransfected GH3 cells for FLNA overexpression (GH3F+) were \nused. FLNA expression and prolactin secretion levels was analysed \nby Western blot, FLNA subcellular localization by indirect immunoflu -\norescence (IFI), viability by clonogenic assay, cell cycle progression \nby flow cytometry, Ki67 index by Immunocitochemistry (ICC), and \ncellular morphology was performed by flow cytometry analysis and \noptical microscopy. The statistical analysis used was ANOVA-Tukey.\nFLNA localization was found in the nucleus and cytoplasm in GH3 \nand GH3F+. FLNA overexpression significantly decreased cellular \nviability (23% less colonies formed) and proliferation capacity (25% \nless Ki67-labelled cells). Morphological analysis showed double \nnumber of pleomorphic cells, longer cellular protrusions and a de -\ncrease in granularity and size in GH3F+. Furthermore, PRL secre -\ntion was decreased in GH3F+.\nThese results show that FLNA has a significant global impact in the \nsurvival and function of tumoral PRL secreting cells, inhibiting prolif -\neration and secretion, placing this protein as a potential therapeutic \ntarget to prolactinomas resistant to conventional treatment. \n66.

Previ -\nously we demonstrated the activation of Nrf2 antioxidant pathway in ABSTRACTS99\nresponse to DNA damage triggered by 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2). Here we \nanalyzed the impact of E2 on p53 and p21 activation and the dam -\nage response in pituitary cells.\nThe experimental pituitary tumour was induced by subcutaneous \nimplantation of silastic capsules with estradiol benzoate (30mg) for \n10 days (E10) in adult male Wistar rats. Control group was implant -\ned with empty capsules. Then, normal and tumoral pituitaries were \ncollected, with cells being cultured and exposed to E2 (1-10-100nM) \nfor 15, 30 and 60min. The p53 and p21 levels were determined \nby western blot. To analyze the cell population involved in the ox -\nidative damage response activation, PRL or GH/p-Nrf2 expression \nwas evaluated by immunofluorescence. Statistical analysis: ANO -\nVA-Fischer (p<0.05).\nIn tumoral cells, a significant increase in p53 protein was detected \nat the cytoplasmic level after 15 and 30min of E2 (1nM) treatment. \nUnder higher doses (10-100nM), this response was observed af -\nter 30 and 60min. At nuclear level, only increases in p53 was de -\ntected at 15min, regardless the dose. The p21 expression showed \na similar profile in both subcellular compartments, with significant \nincreases after 15 and 30min of E2 exposure (1nM) and after 30 \nand 60min after treatment with higher doses. In normal cells, no \nsignificant changes were observed in both p21 and p53 expression. \nThe lactotroph tumoral cell number expressing p-Nrf2 significantly \nincreased after 30min compared to high doses of E2. No changes \nwere detected in the expression of p-Nrf2 in somatotroph cells.\nIn tumoral cells, the pro-oxidant effects induced by E2 trigger the \np53 and p21 activation in order to repair DNA damage through the \nstabilization of Nrf2. This response would mainly have an impact \non PRL tumoral cells. These mechanisms could guarantee the cell \nviability, thus regulating pituitary tumour development.\n67. (219) DXM EFFECT ON WHITENING OF RAT RETROPER -\nITONEAL ADIPOSE TISSUE\nAlejandra Giordano1\n, Ezequiel Harnichar1, Mar\u00eda Guillermina \nZubir\u00eda1, Ignacio Miguel1, Andr\u00e9s Giovambattista1.\n1 Instituto Multidisciplinario de Biolog\u00eda Molecular (IMBICE), \nCONICET-CICPBA-UNLP.\nWe previously reported that Dexamethasone (Dxm) inhibited ther -\nmogenic process in retroperitoneal Adipose Tissue (RPAT); howev -\ner, the Dxm effect on conversion from beige into white adipocytes \nafter cold exposure (whitening) remains unknown. Here, we exam -\nine if Dxm inhibitory effect on thermogenesis was through mitoph -\nagy activation, favoring WAT whitening. First, male rats were divid -\ned into four groups: control (CTR) and Dxm (sc injected 0,03mg/\nKg/d, DXM) housed at RT for 7 days; and CTR and DXM housed \nat 4\u00b0C for 7 days (CTR-C and DXM-C). RPAT pads were dissected \nand processed for quantification of genes involved in thermogen -\nic and mitophagic processes (qRT-PCR). Using 2-way ANOVA for \nstatistical analysis, we found that Dxm inhibited the expression of \ndifferent thermogenic markers (ucp-1, pgc1a and dio2, Interaction \np<0,05) and increased pink1 and atg12 expression under cold ex -\nposure (Interaction p<0.05). To evaluate if Dxm modify the whiten -\ning process, CTR rats were exposed 7 days at cold temperature \nand later housed for 2 days at RT, and injected or not with Dxm \n(DW2d and CW2d, respectively). RPAT was processed for ucp1 and \npink-1 quantification. Result showed that ucp1 levels from CW2d \nand DW2d decreased (p<0.001, vs CTR-C), while pink levels from \nDW2d increased (p<0.01, vs CTR-C and CW2d). We also studied \nthe effect of Dxm in in vitro  differentiated adipocytes. For this pur -\npose, beige adipocytes were incubated or not with 0,25\u00b5M Dxm for \n48hs (DXM and CTR cells, respectively). In the last 4hs a subset of \nCTR and DXM cells were incubated with forskolin (10\u00b5M, CTR-FSK \nand DXM-FSK). Cells were then processed to quantify pink-1 and \natg12  mRNA levels. We found that DXM increased the expression of \nboth mitophagic markers (Dxm p<0.05). Overall, here we described \nfor the first time that WAT browning inhibition by Dxm could be due \nto an increase in mitophagy-related genes expression, favoring the \nwhitening of WAT.

Cold exposure or \u03b23 adrenergic agonist \ntreatment stimulates beige adipocyte generation. Our aim was to \nstudy the effect of prepubertal ovariectomy (OVX) on Retroperito -\nneal Adipose Tissue (RPAT) pad thermogenesis using in vivo  and \nin vitro  models. On age 27 days, rats were randomly split into two \ngroups, sham-ovariectomized (SHX) and OVX-pair fed (OVX-PF). \nOn age 60-day old, one half of rats were kept at 4\u00b0C (C) during 7 \ndays, while the other half was housed at room temperature (RT). \nFood intake and body weight (BW) were daily registered. At sacri -\nfice, RPAT pads were excised and weighed for the analyses of UCP-\n1, Pgc-1\u03b1, \u03b23AR and DIO-2 gene expressions. Isolated adipocyte \nprecursor cells (APCs), from both groups, were induced to differenti -\nate and examined 6 days after 10 \u00b5M forskolin (FSK) addition or not. \nLater on, APCs from SHX RT animals were cultured in either basal \nconditions (B, medium alone) or in medium containing E2 (either \nin the absence or presence of FSK). Gene expression analyses of \nUCP-1, Pgc-1\u03b1 and resistin were performed in cultured cells. BW, \nRPAT mass and circulating triglycerides levels were affected, with \nlower levels found in OVX-PF C rats. Nevertheless, when RPAT \ngene expression levels were analyzed, we found that while UCP-1 \nand DIO-2 diminished that of Pgc-1\u03b1 enhanced in OVX-PF C group; \nconversely, \u03b23AR did not vary. Similar data were found in cells \nfrom RT groups incubated with FSK. Indeed, a decrease in UCP-1 \ngene expression and an increase in that of Pgc-1\u03b1 were observed. \nIn order to find a possible explanation, we noticed that E2 addition \nto APCs from SHX-RT cells showed a significant increase in both \nUCP-1 and Pgc-1\u03b1 expression levels when stimulated with FSK. \nConsidering both, in vivo  and in vitro  results, it can be concluded \nthat RPAT pad-derived cells thermogenesis appears to be inhibited \nby prepuberal OVX (PICT2017-2334 and 2017-2314).\n69. (396) REGULATION OF PITUITARY TUMORS PROLIFER -\nATION INDUCED FOR THE FGF2/FGFR1 PATHWAY\nErnesto Villafa\u00f1e, Juan Pablo Petiti, Alicia In\u00e9s Torres, Liliana \ndel Valle Sosa.\nCentro de microscop\u00eda Electr\u00f3nica, INICSA- CONICET-Fa -\ncultad de Ciencias M\u00e9dicas de la Universidad Nacional de \nC\u00f3rdoba.\nThe growth factors and their receptors dysregulation could lead to \nabnormal growth and progression of pituitary tumors. Previously, \nwe demonstrated that the expression of Fibroblast Growth Factor \n2 (FGF2) increased in experimental prolactinomas development, \nsuggesting its participation in tumor progression. However, the mo -\nlecular mechanisms that generate this effect still now unknown. The \naim was to determine the role of FGF2, FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) \nand MEK-ERK1/2 pathway in the pituitary tumor cells proliferation. \nSomatolactotroph (GH3) and corticotroph (ATt20) pituitary tumor \ncell lines were stimulated with FGF2 (10 and 100 ng/mL). The ex -\npression of FGFR1 was evaluated by western blot. Cell viability \nwas determined by MTT assay after FGF2 stimulation for 24-48h \nin medium with or without 10% serum. Proliferative response was \nanalyzed by BrdU uptake for 24h and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by \nwestern blot after FGF2 stimulus for 30min. Additionally, the MEK \ninhibitor PD 98059 (50uM) was used. Statistics: ANOVA-Post-test: \nTukey. The FGFR1 expression was higher in GH3 than in ATt20. \nFGF2 induced a significant increase in cell viability in GH3 at 24 \nand 48h in both doses, while in ATt20 cells, the cell viability increase \n(p> 0.05) was only observed after FGF2 (100 ng/mL) stimulation for \n48h. Considering that FGF2 effect in GH3 was higher, we continue \nworking on this cell line. The expression levels of ERK1/2 phosphor -\nylated increased after FGF2 (10 and 100 ng/mL) stimulus for 30min \n(p\u02c20.05 vs control). Cell viability and BrdU uptake was significantly \nhigher in the cultures treated with FGF2 to both doses in presence \nof 10% serum, effect that was reverted with PD98059 co-incubation. \nThese findings show that FGF2/FGFR1/ERK1/2 pathway partici -MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

(400) GUT MICROBIOTA ALTERATION IN DIABETIC MICE \nEXPOSED TO CHRONIC STRESS.\nRubinstein MR1, Wald MR1, and Genaro AM1\n1. Instituto de investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas (UCA-CONICET)\nGut microbiota is the group of microorganism (commensal, symbiot -\nic and pathogenic) that we find in our gut. It participates in multiple \nfunctions and an association between unbalanced microbiota and \nseveral diseases, including diabetes, has been reported. Type 1 \ndiabetes (T1D) is characterized by impaired insulin secretion and \nit has been recognized the contribution of psychosocial factors in \nT1D. The aim of the present study is to characterize microbiota \nalterations in diabetic mice exposed to chronic stress. To induced \ndiabetes, we treated male BALB/c mice with multiple low doses of \nstreptozotocin (stz) and then, the animals were subject to chronic \nmild stress (CMS) by a daily application of different mild stressors. \nFecal samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted. 16s \ntotal bacteria, 16s Bacteriodetes and 16s Firmicultes (most abun -\ndant component of the microbiota) were measured by qPCR using \nspecific primers. After 13 weeks of CMS, glycemic levels in diabetic \nand diabetic + CMS were elevated ( p<0.05). No significant changes \nin 16s Bacteroidetes/16s total bacteria and 16s Firmicutes/16s total \nbacteria were detected but a significant CMS effect was found in \n16s Bacteroidetes/16sFirmicutes (Two-way ANOVA, p<0.05). Also \nsignificant correlations were found between glycemia levels vs 16s \nFirmicutes/16s total bacteria (Pearson correlation r=-0.63, p<0.05) \nand glycemia levels vs 16s Bacteroidetes/16s Firmicutes (Pearson \ncorrelation r=-0.57, p<0.05). These results suggest gut microbiota is \naltered by CMS.\n71. (421) THE PRIMARY CORPORA LUTEA ARE THE MAIN \nFORCE IN RESTORING THE STEROIDOGENIC CAPACI -\nTY IN THE OVARY OF MID-PREGNANT VIZCACHAS ( LA-\nGOSTOMUS MAXIMUS , RODENTIA)\nSantiago A Cortasa, Sof\u00eda Proietto, M Clara Corso, Alejan -\ndro R Schmidt, Vanina Jaime, Ruth Cwirenbaum, Pablo IF \nInserra, Alfredo D Vitullo, Ver\u00f3nica B Dorfman, Julia Halperin\nCentro de Estudios Biom\u00e9dicos B\u00e1sicos Aplicados y Desa -\nrrollo (CEBBAD), Universidad Maim\u00f3nides (UMAI), Buenos \nAires, Argentina. \nCONICET, Argentina.  \nShortly after beginning the five month-length pregnancy, a natural \ndecline in serum progesterone (P4) triggers reactivation of the hy -\npothalamus-hypophysis-ovary (HHO) axis in vizcachas. Accessory \ncorpora lutea (aCL) developed after this event has been proposed to \nensure a successful pregnancy by restoring P4 levels. In this work, \nwe compared the steroidogenic input of primary CL (pCL) vs aCL by \nhistological and morphometric analysis, and by immunohistochem -\nical analysis of the luteinization markers: Star, Cyp19, 3\u03b2-HSD, \nVEGF, FSHR, and LHR in early- (EP), mid- (MP) and term-pregnant \nfemales (TP). Non-pregnant ovulated females (NP) were considered \nas the CL-starting point control group. In EP, the ovaries showed only \npCL, whose reactivity levels for the markers mentioned above were \nsignificantly lower than those exhibited by the NP group (p<0.05, \nn=5). This is tied to the reported P4 decline at early stages of preg -\nnancy of vizcachas. Once HHO reactivation occurred, the amount \nof aCL counted in ovaries of the PM group was slightly higher than \nthat of pCL. In addition, luteal cells of both pCL and aCL showed his -\ntological characteristics compatible with secretory activity. Towards \nTP, the structure of both CLs was disorganized, and the luteal cells \nlost their secretory features, all of which agrees with the reported \ndrop in P4 that precedes parturition. Both CLs showed a significant \nincreased reactivity for Star, Cyp19, 3\u03b2-HSD and VEGF in PM. Yet, \nthe luteal area of the pCL was significantly higher than that of aCL \n(p<0.05, n=5). Based on our results, we propose that the LH surge \nderived from HHO reactivation during mid-pregnancy targets pCL \nand boost the steroidogenesis. Since antral follicles express LHR, they also respond to the LH stimuli and become luteinized. As its \narea is about one sixth that of the pCL, aCL surely contribute, but it \nis pCL that is the main force that restores P4 levels from mid-preg -\nnancy of vizcachas.\n72.

Instituto de Biolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental (IByME), \nBuenos Aires, Argentina.\nThe massive release of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers \nthe ovulatory event. This release is regulated by the combined ac -\ntion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and the steroid \nhormones, estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). At gonadotrophs, \nGnRH activates a transcriptional pathway that regulates the expres -\nsion of EGR1 and SF1, both essential transcription factors required \nfor LH\u03b2 promoter activation. The plains vizcachas have shown re -\nproductive axis activity during gestation with changes in hormone \nlevels around mid-pregnancy. The aim of this work was to determine \nthe role of E2 in the pituitary  expression of Sf-1 and Egr-1 involved \nin GnRH transcriptional activation  pathway for LH expression. Dif -\nferent in vivo and ex vivo approaches were developed (N=4/group): \n1- Non- pregnant females were ovariectomized (OVX) and treated \ntwo days with low (OVX-2) or five days with high (OVX-5) doses \nof E2 (5ug/kg or 15ug/kg,  respectively). Sham and OVX animals \nwere used as control groups.  2- Pituitaries of non-pregnant females \nwere probed in a pulsatile  assay under GnRH or GnRH+E2 supple -\nmentation. 3- Pituitaries of non-pregnant females were probed in \na pulsatile assay under different conditions: a) CTL, b) PPT (ER\u03b1 \nagonist) + CYCLO (ER\u03b2  antagonist), c) MPP (ER\u03b1 antagonist) + \nWAY (ER\u03b2 agonist), d) MPP+CYCLO. LH release was measured \nby RIA, whereas pituitary GnRHR, Egr-1 and Sf-1 expression was \nstudied by Western Blot. We observed that E2 induced significant \nchanges (p<0.05). E2 negatively modulated the expression of Sf-1 \nand Egr-1, accompanied by a concordant decrease of LH released. \nThis result was reverted when pituitaries were treated with both ER \nantagonists. In addition, high LH released levels were determined \nexclusively by ER\u03b1 agonist supplementation. These results  show \nthat E2  regulates LH release acting throughout Egr-1 and Sf-1 and \nsuggest ER\u03b1 as the main involved E 2  receptor (Fundaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfi -\nca Felipe Fiorellino, PIP110/14, PICT1281/2014).\n73.

Insti -\ntuto de Biologia y Medicina Experimental (IBYME)\nFolliculostellate cells (FSC) are a non-endocrine, heterogeneous \ncell population of the anterior pituitary that interact with endocrine \npopulations through their long cytoplasmatic processes and by para -\ncrine signaling. The purpose of this work was to study how these \ncells interact with lactosomatotrophs and how this interaction may \nimpact on tumor features as proliferation, angiogenesis and hor -\nmone production. We used a FS cell line (TtT/GF) and a lactosoma -\ntroph tumoral cell line (GH3). To study the effect of released factors, \nwe cultured each cell line in complete media and then changed to \nlow serum media (LSM) for 12 hours. This conditioned media (CM) \nor LSM alone (Control) were used as treatments. Additionally, to \nstudy cell-cell interaction, we grew cells alone or in combination in \na 8:1 proportion (GH3:TtTGF). When GH3 cells were treated with \nFSCs\u2019 CM, cell viability (MTT assay, p<0.05) and cell proliferation \n(FC, p<0.05) were increased. Furthermore, and increase in S phase ABSTRACTS101\nof the cell cycle was observed (FC PI staining, p<0.01). No differenc -\nes were found in Prl or Gh synthesis (RTqPCR, ns) or angiogenic \nfactors release (ELISA, ns). When FSC were cultured with GH3\u2019s \nCM, we observed an increase in cell viability (MTT assay, p<0.05) \nand proliferation (CF, p<0.05). However, a decrease in VEGF pro -\nduction (ELISA, p<0.05) and TNF a synthesis (RTqPCR, p<0.05) \nwas observed. In coculture experiments, an increased number of \nGH3 cells respect to isolated GH3 cells was found (FC, p<0.001). \nNevertheless, a decrease in the percentage of GH3 cells in S phase \n(FC PI staining, p<0.05) as an increase in late apoptosis was deter -\nmined (FC AnnexinV-PI, p<0.05). Gh synthesis was not modulated \nbut Prl was increased in cocultured GH3 cells respect to isolated \nGH3 cells (RTqPCR, p<0.01). Our results suggest that both CFS \nand GH3 cells can release mitogenic factors, that tumor cells can \nmodulate FS function and that a complex regulation exists when \nboth cells grow together and interact.\n74. (483) PITUITARY PROLACTIN RECEPTOR FUNCTION \nREVEALED BY ITS CRE/LOXP MEDIATED DELETION IN \nLACTOTROPES\nDe Winne Catalina, Ornstein Ana, Bec\u00fa de Villalobos Dama -\nsia \nIBYME-CONICET\nProlactin has critical functions during pregnancy and lactation, but \nthe wide distribution of the prolactin receptor (PRLR) suggests \npotential metabolic actions acting on different tissues. In most tis -\nsues, prolactin has a proliferative effect, but it inhibits proliferation \nin primary cultures of lactotropes. Furthermore, Prlr-/- mice develop \nprolactinomas, suggesting an antiproliferative role in the pituitary. \nIn order to evaluate this effect, we generated a transgenic mouse \nmodel with specific deletion of Prlr in lactotropes (lacPrlrKO) using \nthe Cre/loxP technology.\nWe verified a decrease in the mRNA  expression of the Prlr in pitu -\nitary glands of female lacPrlrKO,  and its physiological inactivation \nby lower immunoreactivity of pSTAT5 in  the pituitary after prolactin \nstimulation. Even though pituitary size was  unaltered, prolactin lev -\nels in lacPrlrKO females were increased at 2  months of age. We \nnext evaluated the prolactin releasing capacity  of haloperidol (D2R \nantagonist) and found that lacPrlrKO females have  increased dopa -\nminergic tone at 6 and not at 2 months.  We can therefore infer that \nat an early stage the absence of pituitary PRLR induces prolactin \nrelease and this prolactin may act on hypothalamic  PRLR to favor \nthe dopaminergic control of prolactin, demonstrating that  the hypo -\nthalamic PRLR predominates over the pituitary PRLR, justifying the  \nlack of prolactinoma generation in our model. Furthermore, we ob -\nserved  that lacPrlrKO females have similar body weight and basal \nglucose  levels compared to the controls at an early age, but  at 6 \nmonths they have an improved glucose tolerance.\nOur results  uncover an inhibitory function of the pituitary PRLR on \nprolactin  release, using a unique transgenic mouse model with cell \nspecific  deletion of the PRLR, highlighting not only the pituitary \nPRLR  function, but also the lasting effects of early but transient  high \nprolactin levels on the regulation of the pancreas.\n75.

Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cni -\ncas (CONICET), Argentina\nFoxO3a belongs to the Forkhead box class O (FoxO) transcription \nfactor family which modulates many metabolic processes, ranging \nfrom apoptosis, cell cycle progression, stress resistance to fine en -\ndocrine regulation of reproductive organs. For the latter, it has been reported that GnRH transactivates genes critical for gonadal func -\ntion through another member of the FoxO family: FoxO1. Since we \nhave recently demonstrated local expression and paracrine action of \nGnRH in mammary glands (MG) of pregnant vizcachas, we aimed \nto investigate FoxO3a expression throughout pregnancy and its re -\nlationship with GnRH by immunohistochemistry. In addition, FoxO3 \nexpression levels were assessed in MG explants of term-pregnant \nfemales stimulated with a GnRH analogue. FoxO3a reactivity was \ndetected in all the analyzed stages (early-, mid- and term-pregnant, \nnon-pregnant, and lactating), always in the secretory epithelium of \nthe MG. However, both the percentage of FoxO3a immunoreactive \narea (%IR) and its immunoreactive optic density were significantly \nhigher in early- and non-pregnant than those of the other groups \n(p<0.05 and p<0.0005 respectively, n=5 per group, one-way ANO -\nVA). Moreover, mainly nuclear localization was detected for those \nwith the highest reactivity, whereas in the other groups it was trans -\nlocated to the cytoplasm. Given that phosphorylation of FoxO3a \ninduces its inactivation and translocation to the cytoplasm, these \nresults would indicate that FoxO3a expression profile is strongly tied \nto the levels of cell proliferation and tissue remodeling of the MG \nthroughout the pregnancy of the vizcacha. When incubated in the \npresence of GnRH, the mammary explants exhibited a significant \nincrease in the FoxO3a %IR (p<0.05, n=3, t-test), which pinpoints \nthis transcription factor as a mediator of the MG remodeling mediat -\ned by GnRH. This work contributes to elucidate the role of GnRH as \nan active modulator of the MG remodeling dynamics in vizcachas.\n76.

Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cni -\ncas (CONICET), Argentina\nForkhead box class O (FoxO) transcription factor family modulates \na large number of metabolic processes. Particularly, Foxo3a regu -\nlates cell cycle progression, retaining the tissue dynamics in a qui -\nescence stage. Highly proliferative breast cancers have reported a \nmarked down-regulation of Foxo3a. Since prolactin (PRL) is one of \nthe main modulators of mammary gland (MG) tissue remodeling, \nour objective was to study the expression of Foxo3a in MG under a \nhyperprolactinemic condition. For this, females from three hyperpro -\nlactinemic animal models were evaluated: dopamine type 2 receptor \n(D2R) knockout mice (KO); mice over-expressing the \u03b2subunit of \nthe human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCGB+), and vizcachas with \nsulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemia. MG from wild-type mouse \nmodels and vehicle-treated vizcachas were used as controls. Immu -\nnohistochemistry assays revealed nuclear localization of Foxo3a in \nMG from the three models, indicating transactivation activity of this \ntranscription factor. In addition, all three models showed the same \npattern: a marked decrease in Foxo3a expression in MG from hy -\nperprolactinemic females compared to their controls. Moreover, the \npercentage of Foxo3a immunoreactive area (%IR) was significantly \nlower in MG from hyperprolactinemic mice than in controls (p<0.05, \nn=4 per group, t-test). A similar tendency, but not significant, was \nobserved in MG from hyperprolactinemic vizcachas compared to \nthe controls. Given that PRL has a known role in inducing prolifera -\ntion and differentiation of MG, it is expected to limit the expression \nof markers that operates in the opposite direction of tissue growth, \nsuch as Foxo3a. When PRL levels are deregulated, such an im -\nbalance would incline the tissue towards excessive proliferation, \nfavored by the low expression of Foxo3, as has been reported in \nmammary tumors. Our data contribute to understand the modulation \nof Foxo3a MG expression and to elucidating its participation in MG \nremodeling.MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021102\n77.

Decreased thyroid hor -\nmone level would probably be a hormonal environment that promotes \nchanges in mitochondrial NO bioavailability modulating oxygen con -\nsumption and cell respiration. Alterations in the structure and/or con -\ntent of phospholipid are responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction in \na variety of pathological settings, including hypothyroidism. The aim \nof the present work was to determine whether postnatal hypothy -\nroidism alters lipid profiling in rat heart. Male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats \nweighing approximately 50 g were used in this study and were ran -\ndomly assigned to one of the groups: euthyroid rats (eut, received \nSC injections of 0.9 NaCl (0.1 ml/100 g body weight)) and hypothy -\nroid rats (hypo, received 0.02% methimazole in drinking water for \n60 days). Cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phos -\nphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were isolated and \nidentified by TLC and the quantification was for Bartlett\u2019s technique. \nThe results of the present study showed that hypothyroid animals \nhad a higher total lipid content than euthyroid rats (nmol/protein mg, \nhypo:1132 \u00b1135 vs eut:558\u00b1219,p<0,005n:5). Furthermore, content \nof CL, PE, PA and PC were higher in hypothyroid rats compared with \neut group. Content (nmol/protein mg) of CL (hypo:119\u00b136 vs.eu -\nt:61\u00b119,p<0,05n:5), PE (hypo:528\u00b142 vs.eut:205\u00b1146,p<0,005n:5), \nPA (hypo:210\u00b136 vs.eut:120\u00b127,p<0,005n:5) and PC (hypo:274\u00b176 \nvs.eut:173\u00b135,p<0,05n:5). Results are mean \u00b1 SEM, unpaired t-test \nwas used as statistical analysis (SPSS 23 version). Our results \nsuggest that alterations mainly in cardiolipin level could contribute \nto cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction, together with the decrease in \ncomplex I activity of the respiratory chain of hypothyroid animals. \nThe above can justify the modifications in contractility, heart relax -\nation time and cardiac output that are observed in hypothyroid rats. \n78.

AMH constitutes an indirect, reliable biomarker of the \novarian reserve.\nAim:  To evaluate small ovarian follicle status in girls and adoles -\ncents with hematologic malignancies during and after treatment. \nMethods : Prospective cohort study in children with Acute Lympho -\nblastic Leukaemia (ALL) or Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Serum \nAMH was measured at diagnosis, during chemotherapy and until 3 \nyears after treatment. Secondarily, FSH levels were analysed. Re -\nsults were interpreted according to age or pubertal stage as appro -\npriate and expressed as median (range) or percentage. Results : Twenty-three girls aged 7.3 yr (1-15.7) were included; 15 \nwere prepubertal and 8 pubertal at diagnosis. 83% were diagnosed \nwith ALL, 32% classified as high risk, and 17% had NHL. Total fol -\nlow-up was 4.7 yr (3-5.1). \nAMH was low (<3rd centile) in 20 patients (86.9%) at some point \nduring treatment. In 4 prepubertal girls AMH was low since diagno -\nsis. In the others, a marked decrease was observed within the first \nyear of treatment, being the difference between baseline AMH and \nat 6 and 9 months of treatment significant \n(P 0.0149, P 0.0198). \nFifteen out 20 patients (75%) recovered normal serum AMH; 4 of \nthe 5 girls who did not recover AMH had AMH <25th centile before \ntreatment and a diagnosis of high-risk ALL or NHL, receiving more \naggressive chemotherapy. \nMild increased FSH was seen in 5 pubertal girls.\nConclusion : These preliminary results suggest that most girls with \nALL or NHL suffered a transient dysfunction of the ovarian follicles \nduring chemotherapy, with recovery in a large majority of them in the \nlong-term. Most of the girls with persistently low AMH had received \nmore aggressive chemotherapy. \n79.

Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in worldwide. \nThis vitamin deficiency has been linked with metabolic diseases. \nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with numerous \ncomplications for mother and offspring.   Hypothyroidism is a highly \nprevalent pathology related to metabolic disorders and complica -\ntions in mother and child. \nOBJECTIVE.  To determinate status of vitamin D and its relationship \nwith glycemic regulation indices in hypothyroid pregnant in second \ntrimester of gestation. \nMATERIAL AND METHODS . This study included 305 pregnancy, \nhypothyroid (n=185) and euthyroid (n=120) were seen second (24-\n28 weeks) trimesters.  Each participant performed a 75 g oral glu -\ncose tolerance test. Levels of vitamin d (25OHD), insulin, Thyrotro -\npin, free thyroxine, antithyroid antibodies and insulin were measured \nby chemiluminescence (ACCESS 2- Beckman Coulter). Insulin re -\nsistance (HOMA-IR) was estimated from insulin and blood glucose \nmeasurements. Mean differences were compared using the Student \nt-test, Chi2, and Pearson correlation, with significance level set at \np<0.05. Serum 25OHD concentration (ng /mL) stratified as sufficient \n(> 30), insufficiency (20-30) and deficiency (< 19).\n RESULTS.  The mean age was 29 (SD: 5). Mean level of vitamin \nD was lower in hypothyroid pregnant compared to the control (eu -\nthyroid), p <0.05. Regarding the 25OHD status in hypothyroid vs. \neuthyroid (%) it was observed: 33 vs. 46 sufficient, 52 vs. 44 in -\nsufficiency and 15 vs. 10 deficiency respectively. Three per cent of \nthe euthyroid and 5% of the hypothyroid women presented GDM, \nsignificantly higher in patients with 25OHD levels <30 ng / ml. Lower \nlevels of 25OHD were associated with higher insulin resistance (r = \n-0.07; p <0.05). \nCONCLUSION . Most of the pregnant showed decreased levels of \n25OHD. Our results suggest that low levels of vitamin D and hi -\npothyroidism are associated with the presence of GDM and insulin \nresistance in these women.\n80.

According to WHO adolescence is defined as the ABSTRACTS103\nperiod of growth between 10 and 19 years extended to 21 years. \nThe prevalence of primary, clinical (CHT) and especially subclini -\ncal (SHT) hypothyroidism in childreen-adolescent is less than 2% \nwith a low incidence of hyperthyroidism (HyT). These pathologies \nhave a profound impact on growth, maturation, pubertal develop -\nment, adult height and have been linked to pro-atherogenic met -\nabolic abnormalities. OBJECTIVE . Study the frequency of thyroid \ndysfunction in adolescents treated in a public institution. MATERI -\nALS AND METHODS . We evaluated 134 adolescents of both sexes \nwho attended the laboratory for 6 months. The demographic and \nhormonal data were collected from the Laboratory Informatic Sys -\ntem. Serum thyrotrophin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) were dosed \nby chemiluminescence in ARCHITECT. Results are expressed as \nmean (X) \u00b1 standard error of mean (SEM), ranges, parametric t-test, \nsignificance p <0.05 (GraphPadPRISM 8.0.1). Stages of adoles -\ncence (age) Middle Adolescence (MA): 14 to 16, Late (LA): 17 to \n21; SHT, CHT and HyT according to consensus. RESULTS . The \ngroup included 34 MA and 100 LA, 81% female and 19% male. In \nMA males 35% vs 13% in LA, were similar distribution of female \nbetween groups. TSH (\u00b5IU /mL) and FT4 (ng/dL) in MA 3.36 \u00b1 0.33 \n(0.89 to 8.10) and 0.99 \u00b1 0.09 (0.88 to 1.19), in LA 3.65 \u00b1 7.75 (0.006 \nto 77.91) and 1.05 \u00b1 0.11 (0.85 to 1.41) respectively. The frequen -\ncy of thyroid dysfunction was 16.2%: SHT 13.5% (5% MA, 8.5% \nLA), CHT 0.7% (male LA), HyT 2.0% (Graves Basedow, subclinical \nhyperthyroidism). The female-male ratio was MA 5/2 and LA 15/1. \nCONCLUSION . In our group, the frequency of hypothyroidism was \nhigher than the prevalence reported in the literature, respecting the \npatterns by sex. Our results support the intervention of the endocri -\nnologist for diagnosis, follow-up and eventual treatment in the sus -\npected illness and/or TSH level altered.\nFARMACOCIN\u00c9TICA\n81.

This \ncompound is commercially available as a powder to be mixed with \nfood for oral administration in pigs for 7-10 days. BZD-containing \ndrugs possess the ability to significantly induce certain cytochrome \nP450 (CYP) isozymes in different species, particularly those belong -\ning to the CYP1A family. This work aimed to evaluate in vitro  the \neffect FBZ sustained administration on CYP1A-dependent enzyme \nactivities in pig liver. Eleven (11) piglets were divided in two groups: \nfive (5) animals remained untreated and used as controls; six (6) \nanimals were treated with a FBZ commercial powder mixed with \nfood. The drug concentration in food was 0.01% and animals were \nfed ad libitum  for 10 days. Animals were euthanized for prepara -\ntion of liver microsomes. Two CYP 1A-dependent enzyme activities, \nnamely 7-ethoxuresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and methoxyre -\nsorufin O-demethylase (MROD) were assayed in a spectrofluoro -\nmeter. FBZ and its S-oxygenated metabolites, oxfendazole (OFZ) \nand fenbendazole sulphone (FBZSO2), were detected in the sys -\ntemic circulation of treated piglets. Mean plasma AUCs (\u00b5g.day/mL) \nwere 0.28\u00b10.08 (FBZ), 4.10\u00b10.58 (OFZ) and 4.56\u00b11.01 (FBZSO2). \nThe parent drug FBZ represented around the 46% (4.66\u00b11.59 \u00b5g/g) \nof the total anthelmintic molecules in the liver, followed by OFZ \n(3.11\u00b11.06 \u00b5g/g, 31%) and the inactive FBZSO2 (2.30\u00b10.99 \u00b5g/mL, \n23%). In liver microsomes from treated animals, both EROD and \nMROD enzyme activities increased 24.5-fold (p=0.003) and 17.2-\nfold (p=0.0006), respectively. The sustained administration of FBZ \ncaused the induction of the CYP1A-dependent metabolism in pig \nliver. This fact may affect the metabolic fate of FBZ itself but also \nof other foreign compounds such as aflatoxin B1 present in certain \npig foodstuffs. \n83.

Facultad de \nCiencias Veterinarias (UNCPBA), Campus Universitario \n Organophosphates (OPs) are widely used for crop protection in ag -\nriculture and for the control of ectoparasites in animal husbandry. \nThe sustained use of these chemical compounds increases the risk \nof environmental contamination and/or alteration of different physio -\nlogical cellular functions in farm animals. A number of OPs are sub -\nstrates of hepatic mixed function oxidases, such as those belonging \nto the cytochrome P450 (CYP) and flavin-containing monooxygen -\nase (FMO) families of enzymes. In addition, these xenobiotics may \nalso affect enzyme function by induction or inhibition of their catalytic \nactivities. This work aimed to evaluate in vitro  the effect of the fol -\nlowing OPs: chlorpyrifos (CPF), ethion (ETN), diazinon (DZN) and \ndichlorvos (DCV) on CYP- and FMO-dependent enzyme activities in \ncattle liver. Bovine (n=4) liver microsomes were incubated (10 min at \n37\u00b0C in aerobiosis) in the absence (control assays) and in presence \nof each OP compound under study at 1, 10 and 100 \u00b5M (final con -\ncentrations). Five CYP- or FMO-dependent catalytic activities were \nassayed by spectrofluorimetric or HPLC methods: 7-ethoxyresorufin \nO-deethylase (EROD, for CYP1A1), methoxyresorufin O-demeth -\nylase (MROD, for CYP1A2), benzyloxyresorufin O-debenzylase \n(BROD, for CYP2B), testosterone 6-beta hydroxylase (for CYP3A) \nand benzydamine N-oxidase (for FMO). Only the CYP3A-dependent \nhepatic metabolism was significantly affected by the presence of MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021104\nETN and DZN. ETN, at 10 \u00b5M and 100 \u00b5M, inhibited (p<0.01) tes -\ntosterone 6-beta hydroxylase activity (76% and 81%, respectively) \nin cattle liver microsomes. Similar results were obtained in presence \nof equimolar concentrations of DZN (74% and 93% at 10 \u00b5M and \n100 \u00b5M, respectively; p<0.01). Both ETN and DZN would poten -\ntially interfere with the pattern of the hepatic metabolism of relevant \nCYP3A substrates pharmacologically relevant in bovine medicine, \nsuch as tiamulin, macrolide antibiotics and the ionophore monensin. \n84.

The simultane -\nous administration of TAC and meropenem (MEP) in pediatric kid -\nney transplant patients may led to a significant increase in plasma \nconcentrations of TAC. We hypothesized that this negative pharma -\ncokinetic interaction is due to the inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated \nbiotransformation of TAC by MEP, particularly in those individuals \nlacking the expression of CYP3A5. The aim of this study was to \nevaluate in vitro  the potential metabolic interaction between TAC \nand MEP. Human liver microsomes were prepared with discard liver \nsamples obtained from healthy donors (n=2) and individuals sub -\njected to tumor resection (n=2). The specific CYP3A-dependent en -\nzyme activity, testosterone 6-beta hydroxylase, was assayed in the \nabsence (control) and in presence of TAC (5 and 20 \u00b5M), MEP (10 \n\u00b5M) and the combinations of TAC and MEP. TAC, incubated at 5 and \n20 \u00b5M, inhibited (p<0.05) the CYP3A-mediated 6-beta hydroxylation \nof testosterone (18\u00b113% and 51\u00b116%, respectively). This finding \nmay confirm the high affinity of CYP3A4 for TAC. MEP, at 10 \u00b5M, \ndid not affect this enzyme reaction. After co-incubations of TAC and \nMEP, testosterone 6-beta hydroxylase activities resembled those \nobserved when TAC was incubated alone. In control assays, rates \nof TAC metabolism were 30\u00b120 and 120\u00b140 pmol/min.mg of mic -\nrosomal protein, respectively. MEP, at 10 \u00b5M, significantly inhibited \n(p<0.05) the hepatic biotransformation of TAC; rates (pmol/min.mg) \nof TAC metabolism (at 5 and 20 \u00b5M) were 20\u00b110 (43\u00b124% inhibi -\ntion) and 70\u00b150 (49\u00b123% inhibition), respectively. These preliminary \nresults show a metabolic interaction between TAC and MRP on CY -\nP3A-dependent metabolism in human liver. The enhancement of the \nsystemic availability of TAC observed in vivo  in the co-administration \nwith MEP would be due to the inhibition of the CYP3A4-dependent \nbiotransformation of the immunosuppressive drug. \nFarmacognosia - Farmacobot\u00e1nica\n85.

Under physiological con -\nditions, this process is strictly regulated being focal and self-limited \nin time. Nevertheless, disbalances between the biochemical signals \nthat regulate angiogenesis may occur, resulting in a chronic neovas -\ncularization that takes part in a large number of diseases including \nneoplastic transformation, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and differ -\nent ocular conditions. In this context, the development of new agents \ncapable of downregulating pathological angiogenesis become rele -\nvant in the field of drug discovery. \nThe flora from Argentina stands out among the different sources \nof new bioactive molecules. In previous studies conducted by our \nresearch team, the ethanol extract of Zanthoxylum coco  showed \na remarkable antiangiogenic effect. Therefore, this species was \nsubmitted to the bioassay guided isolation of its active principle. \nThis process involved the alternation of different chromatographic \ntechniques with the evaluation of the antiangiogenic activity in terms \nof the tube formation assay. One compound identified by diverse \nspectroscopic techniques as the alkaloid skimmianine was isolated. \nThis molecule significantly inhibited tube formation even at 12.5 mg/\nmL. HPLC analysis showed that this compound is one of the major \nconstituents of the ethanol extract of Z. coco .

(321) POLYPHENOLS FROM ANDEAN POTATO INDUCE \nCITOTOXICITY IN GLIOBLASTOMA CELLS BY MODIFING \nTHE REDOX STATUS\nVazquez M., Filiberti V., Andreu A.B, Silveyra M.X.\nInstituto de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas, IIB-CONICET-UNM -\ndP. \nAndean potatoes ( Solanum tuberosum  ssp. andigena ) are a good \nsource of dietary polyphenols, such as chlorogenic acid and antho -\ncyanins. This study aimed to analyze the cytotoxic activity of poly -\nphenols from Andean potato var. Santa Mar\u00eda on glioblastoma cells. \nIn order to test this, we first assayed the cell viability by incubating \ndifferent concentrations of polyphenol extracts with human glioblas -\ntoma LN-229 cells. We observed that polyphenols induced changes \nin the morphology of the cells and reduced the viability in a con -\ncentration-dependent manner. Then, we calculated the CC50 (50% \ncytotoxic concentration) of total polyphenols extract and proceeded \nto investigate how the cells dye. First, we treated the cells with the \nCC50 for 4 hr and measured the intracellular reactive oxygen species \n(ROS) using the probe H2DCFDA. At the beginning of treatment, the \nROS levels decreased compared to control, but after 2 hr, they in -\ncreased, suggesting that the polyphenols altered the redox homeo -\nstasis in glioblastoma cells. To analyze what happens in the mito -\nchondria, we determined the potential mitochondrial membrane with \nRhodamine 123. After 3 hr of treatment, we observed a significant \ndecrease, confirming that polyphenols would induce a dysfunction in \nthe mitochondria that contributes to increased ROS levels. Finally, \nwe performed a DAPI staining of cells\u2019 nuclei and visualized them \nwith fluorescence microscopy, observing significant alterations in \ntreated cells such as bright nuclear condensation and, in some cas -\nes, fragmented nucleus. However, we checked the genomic DNA \nfragmentation in agarose gel, and we determined that polyphenols \nproduced a slight reduction in genomic DNA size with a lack of oligo -\nnucleosomal fragments, suggesting the activation of a mechanism \nof death caspase-independent. These findings demonstrated that \npolyphenols from Andean potato var.

(*) contribuci\u00f3n equitativa\nThe off-label use of imiquimod (IQ) for hemangioma treatment has \nshown clinical benefits. We have previously reported a selective di -\nrect IQ-cytotoxic effect on transformed H5V endothelial cells (EC) \n(hemangioma model) vs normal 1G11 EC. We observed a severe \nimbalance in antioxidant defense and apoptosis in H5V but not in \n1G11. To further address this issue, we studied the possibility of IQ \nbeing a mitochondrial toxicant. H5V and 1G11 cells were treated \nwith IQ (0-50 \u00b5g/mL) for 2, 4, 12 or 24 h and analyzed for reac -\ntive oxygen species (ROS) with DCFH2-DA probe and mitochondrial \nstress by MitoTrackerTM Red CMXRos fluorescence. Viability assays \nwere performed using the standard culture medium with 5.5 mM \nglucose (regular) or media containing 25 mM glucose (high) or 25 \nmM galactose (depleted). IQ treatment increased ROS level in H5V \nafter 2 h (35-60%; p<0.05) but in 1G11 only at 4 h (\u033450%; p<0.05). \nMitochondrial membrane potential in H5V cells was affected after 4 \nand 12 h treatment, revealed by a decreased in MitoTracker fluores -\ncence (\u224850%; p<0.05). In contrast, 1G11 cells were unaffected and \nonly presented a significant 30%-decrease in fluorescence after 12 \nh with 50 \u00b5g/mL IQ (p<0.05). Cells grown in a high glucose medium \ncan adapt to a glycolytic phenotype. By assessing the effect of IQ in \nthis medium, both cell lines became significantly less affected than \nwith the regular culture medium. On the contrary, by forcing cells to \nrespiration with galactose instead of glucose-containing medium, IQ \ntreatment enhanced cell death in both cell lines, being fully cytotoxic \nfor H5V (p<0.05) but leaving \u224832% 1G11 cells still alive at the high -\nest IQ concentrations.\nThese results provide more evidences about the higher suscepti -\nbility of transformed EC to IQ, where an early ROS production and \nmitochondrial dysfunction drove H5V cells to death. By shifting cells \ntowards diminished respiration in absence of glucose, we proved IQ \nacts as a mitochondrial toxicant in both EC lines.\n90. (249) BEHAVIORAL AND MOLECULAR BASES OF THE \nANTHELMINTIC ACTIVITY OF ESSENTIAL OILS EX -\nPLORED IN THE NEMATODE CAENORHABDITIS ELE -\nGANS\nGuillermina Hernando, Ornella Turani and Cecilia Bouzat\nInstituto de Investigaciones Bioqu\u00edmicas de Bah\u00eda Blanca, \nDepartamento de Biolog\u00eda, Bioqu\u00edmica y Farmacia, Universi -\ndad Nacional del Sur (UNS)-CONICET, 8000 Bah\u00eda Blanca, \nArgentina.\nControl of helminth infections in both human and veterinary med -\nicine currently relies mainly on chemotherapy, but acquisition of \nresistance is an increasing problem that leads to the urgent need \nof discovery of novel drugs. C. elegans  has demonstrated to be a \nmodel system for the discovery of new anthelmintics and for char -\nacterizing their mechanisms of action and resistance. Essential oils \n(EOs) are natural products produced by aromatic plants. We per -\nform paralysis assays of wild-type and mutant C. elegans  strain to \nidentify EOs with potential anthelmintic activities, reveal the active \ncomponents, their target sites, and mechanisms of action. We found \nthat EOs belonging to different orders produce rapid paralysis of \nC. elegans  with EC50 values between 0.02-2 % EOs. All EOs test -\ned also inhibited egg hatching, a property related to anthelmintic \nability. Thus, EOs mediate both rapid and long-term anthelmintic \neffects. We examined anthelmintic properties of terpenoids and \nphenylpropenes and determined that all compounds tested produce \nboth paralysis and egg-hatching inhibition. By testing mutant worms, \nwe identified the muscle L-AChR and GABA receptors as EOs and \ntrans-cinnamaldehyde (TC, phenylpropene) targets. Thus, by mod -MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021106\nulating two receptors with key roles in worm motility, these EOs \nemerge as novel sources of anthelmintic compounds. To unequivo -\ncally confirm that these receptors are targets of TC and to describe \nthe mechanism by which they affect these receptors, we performed \nwhole-cell and single-channel recordings from C. elegans  muscle \ncells. Electrophysiological recordings at the single-channel level re -\nvealed that TC reduces L-AChR channel activity without affecting \nchannel properties. The results are compatible with the action of \nthese drugs as allosteric inhibitors. It is hoped that this work can \nupdate the recent progress on natural nematicide discoveries and \nprovide new ideas for the design and mechanism of action studies \nof anthelmintics. \n91.

The objective of the present \nwork was the development and assessment of the pharmacokinetic \n(PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of the coencapsulation of \ncarvedilol and curcumin in nanomicellar dispersions of Soluplus in \nspontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR).\nNanomicellar dispersions of 10% w/v Soluplus containing carvedilol \n3 mg/ml,  curcumin 2 mg/ml , or both were prepared using the sol -\nvent evaporation technique. Plasma pharmacokinetics and hemo -\ndynamic response after oral administration of carvedilol 9 mg/kg, \ncurcumin 6 mg/kg or carvedilol/curcumin 9/6 mg/kg were assessed \nin  20 male SHR rats after carotid artery cannulation.  \nResults: Plasma curcumin levels were comparable after coadminis -\ntration of carvedilol/curcumin or curcumin only. Coencapsulation did \nnot modify the PK profile of carvedilol. Curcumin oral administration \ndid not induce changes in blood pressure and heart rate. Coencap -\nsulation resulted in a greater MAP reduction when compared with \ncarvedilol  (-28,5\u00b14,0 % vs \u201312,1\u00b13,1%, p<0.05).  HR reduction was \ncomparable after oral administration of carvedilol or coencapsula -\ntion.\nConclusions: Coencapsulation of curcumin with carvedilol in na -\nnomicellar dispersions potentiates the antihypertensive effect of \ncarvedilol without modifying the bradycardic responser nor the phar -\nmacokinetic profile. These results suggest that coencapsulation of \ncarvedilol and curcumin  represents a potential pharmacodynamic \nsynergistic combination for the management of arterial hyperten -\nsion.\n92. (305) MOD-1 RECEPTOR AS A NOVEL DRUG TARGET \nFOR ANTHELMINTIC THERAPY\nNoelia Rodriguez Araujo, Guillermina Hernando, Jerem\u00edas \nCorradi and Cecilia Bouzat.\nInstituto de Investigaciones Bioqu\u00edmicas de Bah\u00eda Blanca, \nDepartamento de Biolog\u00eda, Bioqu\u00edmica y Farmacia, Univer -\nsidad Nacional del Sur (UNS)-CONICET, Bah\u00eda Blanca, Ar -\ngentina.\nCaenorhabditis elegans  (Nematoda) contains a homomeric \n5HT-gated chloride channel, MOD-1, that belongs to the Cys-loop \nreceptor family and modulates locomotor behavior. Although it binds \n5-HT, MOD-1 is not present in vertebrates, and it therefore emerges as a possible anthelmintic target. We deciphered MOD-1 pharma -\ncological properties and searched for novel modulators with poten -\ntial anthelmintic activity by performing patch-clamp recordings from \nmammalian cells heterologously expressing MOD-1 and locomotor \nactivity assays in C. elegans . Whole-cell recordings showed that \nMOD-1 desensitizes slowly and recovers from desensitization with \na time constant of about 1 s. Compared to the vertebrate 5-HT3A \nreceptor, dose-response curves were similar for 5-HT but very differ -\nent for the orthosteric agonists tryptamine and 2-Me-5HT.  The an -\nthelmintic drugs ivermectin (IVM), levamisole, and piperazine (PZE), \nwhich are agonists of other Cys-loop receptors, did not activate \nMOD-1. However, IVM produced a slight and irreversible inhibition \nand PZE produced a profound and reversible inhibition of MOD-1 \ncurrents elicited by 5-HT. The analysis indicated that PZE is a non -\ncompetitive antagonist of MOD-1, revealing a novel function of this \ndrug. To relate the molecular effects to behavioral actions of these \ncompounds, we performed locomotor activity assays in C. elegans . \nWe found that 5-HT produces rapid and reversible paralysis of wild-\ntype (WT) worms while MOD-1 mutants are partially resistant under \nsimilar conditions, thus indicating that MOD-1 is the main 5-HT tar -\nget in this type of assays. Additional assays using drug combinations \nin WT and mutant strains confirmed the inhibition of MOD-1 activity \nby IVM and PZE. The elucidation of the molecular pharmacology of \nMOD-1 enhances our knowledge of function and drug selectivity of \nCys-loop receptors and contributes to determine its potential as a \nnovel target for anthelmintic therapy. \n93.

It has two main domains: Regulator of G protein \nSignaling (RGS) homology domain (RH), and protein kinase domain \n(KD). The mechanism of GPCRs phosphorylation by GRK5 requires \nthe disruption of an ionic lock in RH/KD interface, leading to a more \nstable complex with the GPCR that enhances catalytic properties \nof the kinase.\nTo obtain GRK5 inhibitors we performed a docking-based virtual \nscreening (VS) using pdb ID 4TND to search within Enamine Ad -\nvanced Collection for compounds able to bind to RH/KD interface, \nintending to strengthen ionic lock and avoid the catalytically compe -\ntent conformation to be reached. We obtained a list of hits ordered \nby docking energy, ranging from -10.4 to -9.7. Using Protein Ligand \nInteraction Profiler tool, we evaluated non-covalent interactions \nbetween GRK5 and predicted docking poses, and observed sev -\neral hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds joining residues \nfrom RH and KD. Also, interesting interactions such as salt bridg -\nes, halogen bonds and \u03c0-cation were found. Accordingly, we chose \n15 compounds to be purchased and evaluated in biological activity \nassays, for what we setted up FRET-based determinations to quan -\ntify real-time intracellular cAMP. HEKT Epac-SH187 cells co-trans -\nfected with GRK5 and \u03b21AR or \u03b22AR were stimulated with 10\u00b5M \nisoproterenol (Iso) and AUC (area under curve) values of 10min \nresponse were determined in FlexStation3 at 37\u00b0C. AUCs were re -\nduced from 244.4\u00b124 to 112.5\u00b17.4 for \u03b21AR and from 138.7\u00b110 to \n64.73\u00b13.45 for \u03b22AR (p<0.05) by GRK5 overexpression (confirmed \nby Western Blot).\nBoth computer aided identification of potential GRK5 ligands and \nobtention of a methodology for screening these compounds will al -\nlow us to identify candidate inhibitors of GRK5 in the search of new \ncardioprotective drugs.\n94.

Mast cells were obtained \nby peritoneal lavage and purified in discontinuous gradient of Per -\ncoll\u2019s solution. Cell purity was assessed by staining with 0.2 % tolu -\nidine blue. Mast cell viability was assessed with 0.1 % trypan blue. \nCompound 48/80 (0.1 mg/ml) was used as a mast cell degranulator \nand pro-inflammatory stimulus. Different concentrations of the 11 \nsynthetic drugs (10 to 320 \u03bcM), as well as different incubation times \nwere used. In both incubation solutions and remaining cells the re -\nlease of \u03b2-hexosaminidase was quantified spectrophotometrically \nas a marker of mast cell activation. The percentage of \u03b2-hexosamin -\nidase release and EC50 were calculated for each drug. Mast cell \nmorphology was evaluated by light microscopy after incubations. \nStatistical analysis: ANOVA-1/Tukey-Kramer.\nResults : Enzymatic release under basal conditions showed values \nbelow 10 %. Compound 48/80 significantly stimulated the release of \n\u03b2-hexosaminidase from mast cells (P<0.0001). Of all the synthetic \ndrugs tested, ( Z)-2-bromo-3-(furan-3-yl) methyl acrylate and ( E)-2-\nbromo-3-(3-bromophenyl) methyl acrylate inhibited enzymatic re -\nlease, at concentrations of 320 \u03bcM for the first drug (P<0.0001), and \n160 \u03bcM (P<0.001) and 320 \u03bcM (P<0.0001) for the second drug. The \npercentage of cell vitality was not affected. The biochemical results \nwere consistent with the morphological ones.\nConclusions: The new synthetic drugs ( Z)-2-bromo-3-(furan-3-yl) \nmethyl acrylate and ( E)-2-bromo-3-(3-bromophenyl) methyl acrylate \ninhibit mast cell degranulation without affecting cell viability. The im -\nplications of these results are relevant as a basis for the develop -\nment of new anti-inflammatory and mast cell stabilizing drugs.\n95.

Although, it crosses the blood brain bar -\nrier. Previous results indicated that systemic acute SILD administra -\ntion facilitated hippocampal (HP) long-term potentiation, a synaptic \nplasticity phenomenon that underlies some types of learning and \nmemory processes. Objectives:  to evaluate the effects of SILD on \nacquisition of HP-dependent memories, and to identify the structure \nactivity relationships driving SILD interaction with PDE-5 and to \nfurther search for derivatives with higher hydrophilicity able to re -\nstrict its passage to the brain while maintaining or improving their \ninhibitory activity. Material and methods:  male Wistar rats were \nadministered with an acute SILD dose 2 h before exposure to nov -\nel object recognition (NOR) test, modified Y-maze, step-down and \ncontextual fear conditioning. Twenty-four hours later the memory \nexpression was evaluated. Also, hydrophilic SILD derivatives were \nidentified by in silico  methods.  Results:  SILD enhanced  the % of \nfreezing after weak fear conditioning (unpaired t-test) and  the laten -\ncy to step-down (Mann Whitney test). Surprisingly, it reduced novel \nobject (unpaired t-test) and novel arm exploration (two-way ANOVA) \nwhen compared to controls. On the other hand, molecular docking identified SILD-PDE-5 pharmacophoric contacts, with some hydro -\nphilic derivatives of SILD already described in the bibliography being \ndocked within the PDE-5 binding site. Conclusions:  these results \nrevealed that SILD divergently contribute to HP-dependent memory \nformation, probably depending on the stimulus nature and participa -\ntion of other brain structures. Furthermore, these results support the \nexperimental evaluation of SILD derivatives that could avoid these \nand other possible unwanted central effects, but promising main -\ntenance of their inhibitory power on PDE-5 at the peripheral level.\n96. (494) THE RH DOMAIN OF GRK2 IS INVOLVED IN ENDO -\nTHELIN RECEPTOR DESENSITIZATION\nRipoll Sonia, Echeverr\u00eda Emiliana, Torralba Valeria, Monczor \nFederico, Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia.\nLaboratorio de Transducci\u00f3n de Se\u00f1ales y Dise\u00f1o de F\u00e1rma -\ncos , ININFA, FFYB, UBA,\nEndothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and proinflammatory \npeptide implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus and \nhypertension via activation of the endothelin receptor A (ETA) and B \n(ETB). Both G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) couple to Gq and \nPLC signalling pathway. Previous reports suggested that ET recep -\ntors are desensitized by GPCRs kinase 2 (GRK2) but independently \nof its kinase activity and that negative regulation by ET-1 of insulin\nsignalling may involve GRK2 and heterologous desensitization of \ninsulin receptor. The purpose of this study was to determine molec -\nular mechanisms underlying negative regulation of ET-1 response \nwith particular attention to the possible involvement of RH domain of \nGRK2 as a first step to elucidate insulin resistance mediated by ET-\n1. To do that, we characterized Ca2+ response and desensitization \nto ET-1 in HEK293 cells transfected with GRK2 variants containing \ndifferent GRK2 domains or mutants. \nWe found that after 15 min of pre-treatment, cells are completely de -\nsensitized to ET-1 stimulation p<0.05. Although none of the variants \nof GRK2 could revert this phenomenon, a 20% higher response to \nET-1 was obtained after knocking down GRK2 with an antisense \nconstruct and a slighter difference between desensitized and control \nresponse p<0.05. Moreover, when cells are transfected with the RH \ndomain of GRK2 the response to ET-1 decreased in a 19%. Similar \nresults were obtained after pharmacological inhibition of the kinase \nor RH activities of GRK2. \nThese findings suggest that desensitization of ET receptors after \nexposure to ET-1 involves the RH domain of GRK2 as was proved \nby RH domain overexpression and pharmacological inhibition. Con -\nsidering that it has been proposed that desensitization of ETA may \nlead to cross-desensitization of insulin receptor, these findings point \nto the RH domain of GRK2 as a potential target for overcoming insu -\nlin resistance that should be further investigated. \n97. (574) SKF96365 IS A SELECTIVE INHIBITOR OF CA2+ \nRELEASE-ACTIVATED CA2+ CHANNELS (CRAC CHAN -\nNELS) RATHER THAN A TRPC CHANNEL-SELECTIVE \nINHIBITOR\nSebastian Susperreguy, Karina Formoso, Julieta Mansilla Ri -\ncartti, Adriana Lopez Guerra and Lutz Birnbaumer. \nInstitute of Biomedical Research (BIOMED UCA-CONICET), \nCatholic University of Argentina, Buenos Aires C1107AFF, \nCABA\nBackground and puropose: SKF-96365 (SKF) has been broadly \nused as a tool to discern TRPC participation in the Store Operat -\ned Ca2+ Entry (SOCE) phenomenon, being generally accepted that \nSKF96365 is a TRPC channel-selective inhibitor and is sold as such \n(Sigma Aldrich cat #S7809, Tocris cat #1147, Alomone cat #S-175). \nHowever, SKF was also used as a non-selective blocker of SOCE. \nConsidering that the effect of SKF96365 on the SOCE mechanism \nremains controversial and taking advantage of the TRPC 7KO \nMEFs, we hypothesized that SK96365 blocks SOCE (or ROCE) by \nblocking ORAI1-based channels instead of inhibiting TRPC-based \nchannels.\nExperimental approach: TRPC 7KO MEF cells, a unique cell model \nin which the seven TRPC are absent, were used to elucidate the \neffect of SKF 96365 on native ORAI1-based channels. In addition MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021108\nTRPC 7KO and ORAI1 KO MEFs were transfected with ORAI1 plus \nSTIM1 to constitute CRAC channels by heterologous expression.. \nTRPC-based channels were test for SKF sensitivity in HEK293 in \nwhich TRPC6 was stably expressed and Ca2+ influx was activated \nwith OAG. SKF effect was always studied by changes in Tg-activat -\ned Ca2+ influx monitored by FUR2-AM method and the expression \nlevel of TRPC, ORAI and STIM were analyzed by RT-PCR.\nKey results: We found Tg-evoked SOCE was nearly 50% sup -\npressed by 5\u00b5M SKF in TRPC 7KO MEF cells. In addition, the in -\ncrement in Tg-evoked SOCE produced by the transfection of ORAI1 \nin ORAI1 KO MEFs and ORAI1 plus STIM1 in TRPC 7KO MEFs \nwas completely prevented by 5\u00b5M SKF. OAG-activated Ca2+ entry \nin HEK293 stably transfected with TRPC6 was insensitive at ORAI1 \noverexpression and GSK7975A treatment in contrast to TRPC7KO \nMEFs in which Tg-activated Ca2+ influx was sensitive to GSK7975A. \nFinally, we showed TRPC-based Ca2+ influx in HEK293-TRPC6 was \nbarely reduced by 10 \u00b5M SKF and 50 \u00b5M dose was needed to block \nOAG-activated Ca2+ influx.\nConclusions and implications: In conclusion, we report convincing \nevidence showing that SKF96365 acts as a blocker of CRAC chan -\nnels in MEF cells having no TRPC. In addition, SKF  showed higher \npotency to block CRAC channels compared to its potency against \nTRPC channels. This finding suggests we should be in cautious \nwhen analyze results where SKF is used as a pharmacologic agent \nto asses TRPC channels activity. \nFARMACOLOG\u00cdA CARDIOVASCULAR Y RENAL\n98.

Oral Nbv also prevented \ncardiac stunning in EuT hearts more than in HypT rats. However, \nin hypothyroid hearts NO production reduced cardioprotection. For \nunderstanding the differences in oral Nbv effects between EuT and \nHypT hearts, we have a) compared the effects of Nbv with those \nof atenolol (Atl), a selective \u03b21-blocker, and b) assessed the role \nof NO in oral-Nbv treated EuT and HypT rats, during sI/R.  Rats \nbecame HypT by s.c. daily injected 20 \u03bcg/kg T3 for 15 days. EuT \nand HypT rats were treated with 20 mg/kg Nbv daily administered in \ndrinking water during 7 days. Other EuT group was similarly treated \nwith 30 mg/kg/day Atl. Isolated perfused ventricles inside a calorim -\neter were exposed to sI/R (30 min I/ 45 min R). Left intraventricular \npressure (P, mmHg) and total heat rate (Ht, mW/g) were measured. \nIn Nbv-treated hearts the NO-synthases were blocked by perfus -\ning L-NAME. Results: Atl improved PICR (postischemic contractile \nrecovery) in EuT to 64.5\u00b13.2% of pre-I (vs 14.2\u00b12.5 % in EuT-C, \np<0.05) and P/Ht  (muscle economy) to  3.1\u00b10.7 mmHg.g.mW-1(vs \n1.0\u00b10.4 in EuT-C, p<0.05) but increased diastolic contracture during \nR (\u0394LVEDP) to 32.0\u00b16.9 mmHg (p <0.05). In EuT, L-NAME strongly \ndecreased PICR to 18.2\u00b10.9 % (p<0.05 vs 78.8\u00b110.6% in EuT-Nbv) \nand P/Ht to 1.3\u00b10.2 mmHg.g.mW-1 (p<0.05 vs 5.32\u00b10.87), with high \n\u0394LVEDP (31.3\u00b15.3 mmHg). In HypT, L-NAME prevented the poor \ncardioprotection of Nbv with higher \u0394LVEDP. Conclusions: a) Atl \nwas less cardioprotective than Nbv in EuT, so \u03b21-blockade explains \npart of Nbv beneficial effect; b) the additive Nbv cardioprotection is \nrelated to NO, which could induce vasodilation or direct myocardial \neffect; c) the low Nbv cardioprotection in HypT rats seems related to \na reduced NO production.

Since dronedarone is another class-III \nantiarrhythmic without iodine in structure, the aim of this work was \nto evaluate the differences with amiodarone, by studying the effect \nof perfusing dronedarone before the I/R protocol in rat hearts. Iso -\nlated cardiac ventricles from Wistar rats were quickly perfused and \nstimulated at 3 Hz, introduced inside a calorimeter at 37\u00b0C, and then \nstabilized and simultaneously measured the signals of left intraven -\ntricular pressure (LVP) and heat rate, before and during a protocol \nof I/R (30 min I/45 min R). There were calculated the maximal LVP in \ncontraction (P, mmHg), total heat rate (Ht, mW/g), diastolic pressure \n(LVEDP), contraction/relaxation rates and times, and muscle econ -\nomy (P/Ht, in mmHg/mW.g). Dronedarone (Dnd) was perfused at 1 \n\u00b5g/ml, during 20 min before I/R (n = 5) and compared to non-treated \nrat hearts (control, n = 5). Results: Dnd improved the post-ischemic \ncontractile recovery (PICR) up to 62.6 \u00b1 7.9% of initial P (p<0.01 vs. \n11.8 \u00b1 5.3% in control) and P/Ht to 86.2 \u00b1 18.3% (p<0.01 vs 18.9 \u00b1 \n8.5% in control), both values at the end of R. During I/R, Dnd group \nincreased the \u0394LVEDP, but improved the relaxation times at the start \nof reperfusion. Conclusions: a) perfusion of Dnd reduced the stun -\nning consequent to ischemia and reperfusion, having the advantage \nover amiodarone, b) Dnd improved both, contractility and muscle \neconomy during reperfusion, but it did not reduce the diastolic con -\ntracture during I/R (UNLP- X795).\n100.

GColareda@outlook.com.ar.\nClinically, young women have a lower incidence of cardiovascular \ndisease than men, but differences disappear when estrogens de -\ncline. Estrogens have cardioprotective mechanisms, but effects and \nmechanisms of testosterone on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury are \ncontradictory. Previous results showed that aged female rat hearts \nhad less postischemic contractile (PICR) and muscle economy \n(MER) recoveries than young female rat hearts (SAFE 2016). In this \nwork, we studied the influence of ageing on the mechano-energetics \nof male rat hearts in two post-ischemic stunning models: moder -\nate (I/Rm) and severe (I/Rs). Young (YM, n=10) and aged (AgM, \nn=12) male rat hearts were perfused inside a calorimeter at 37\u00b0C to \nmeasure left ventricular pressure (LVP, mmHg) and total heat rate \n(Ht, mW/g) and calculated the maximal contractile (P) and diastol -\nic (LVEDP) values, and muscle economy (P/Ht). Results: Before I, \nageing reduced P (YM: 84.6\u00b16.8 vs AgM: 51.9\u00b15.4 mmHg, p< 0.05) \nbut increased the contractile energy expenditure (Ht/P: 0.21\u00b10.03 \nvs 0.09\u00b10.03 mW/mmHg.g), without changing Ht (p>0.15). Surpris -\ningly, in I/Rm PICR was higher in AgM than in YM (77.4\u00b112.9 vs ABSTRACTS109\n45.3\u00b16.2% of pre-I), as well as MER (100.3\u00b112.5 vs 57.2\u00b18.1%). \nThe same comparisons were obtained in I/Rs:  PICR and MER were \nhigher in AgM than in YM (PICR: 78.5\u00b111.5 vs 14.5\u00b12.4%; MER: \n94\u00b18 vs 19.8\u00b15.4%). Since accumulation of adipose tissue in AgM \ncould raise aromatase and circulating estradiol levels, thus contrib -\nuting to protection in I/R, we evaluated whether cardioprotection was \nrelated to NO production, as one of estrogenic pathways. However, \nperfusion of the NOS blocker L-NAME 30 uM before I/Rs did not \nreduce PICR nor MER in AgM hearts (75\u00b16 and 100\u00b12%). Conclu -\nsions: unlike females, in males the ageing plays a cardioprotective \nrole in I/R. Aged male rat hearts recovered contractility and economy \nmore than younger male and aged female ones. However, AgM car -\ndioprotection was not due to NO production (X-795 UNLP).\nFARMACOLOG\u00cdA CL\u00cdNICA\n101.

Patients \nwith high-risk histopathological features and orbital RB receive in -\ntensive i.v chemotherapy including doxorubicin to prevent fatal CNS \ndissemination. Other anthracycline, idarubicin, is less cardiotoxic, \nmore lipophilic favoring penetration across the blood\u2013brain barrier, \nand presents the active metabolite idarubicinol favoring antitumor \nactivity in CNS. Idarubicin use in middle-income countries is limited \nby restricted commercial availability and high costs. Our aim was to \ncompare the pharmacological sensitivity of both anthracyclines in \ncell lines derived from CNS disseminated patients.\nWe compared the growth-inhibitory activity of both anthracyclines in \ntwo primary cell lines derived from CNS dissemination (HPG-CSF-1, \nHGP-CSF-2) established at our hospital and 1 primary cell line from \nan intraocular tumor enucleated upfront (HPG-RBT-12L) used as \ncontrol. Cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of drugs \nand cell viability was assessed using MTT. EC50 was calculated.\nIdarubicin EC50 was 7- to 8-fold lower than the EC50 of doxorubi -\ncin in HPG-CSF-1 and HPG-CSF-2. This difference was 1.7-fold in \nHPG-12L showing low and similar sensitivity to both anthracyclines. \nAssuming a proportional increase in drug exposure with the dose, \nthis result may imply that doxorubicin dosage should be increased \n7 to 8 times to obtain a comparable activity in high-risk patients. \nHowever, these dosages would exceed the maximum recommend -\ned cumulative dose related to doxorubicin associated cardiotoxicity. \nBased on our results of in vitro  chemosensitivity, equivalence in dos -\nages associated with cardiotoxicity, and favorable biological charac -\nteristics of idarubicin it continues to be the anthracycline of choice \nin disseminated RB.\n102.

An inadequate nutrition results in defective organ structures \nand elicit long-term effects leading to premature aging. Cellular se -\nnescence is an irreversible growth arrest triggered by exogenous or \nendogenous stress and may be an important factor that contributes \nto the aging phenotype. The aim of this work was to study the effect \nof protein malnutrition during pregnancy and its relationship with the \nestablishment of the senescence in mouse embryonic fibroblasts \n(MEFs). CF-1 female mice were fed with a normal protein diet (NP \n20%) or a low protein diet (LP 8%) from a week before mating un -\ntil MEFs extraction (13.5-day-old embryos). The statistical analysis \nwas performed by t-tests and 2-way ANOVA; p values lower than \n0.05 were considered statistically different. MEF from LP embryos \nshowed a large and flat morphology, premature cell cycle arrest \nand reduced cell viability at lower passage than MEF from NP em -\nbryos, indicating an early induction of different cellular senescence \nmarkers (p<0.05). The oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity was \nevaluated by measuring ROS production in presence or absence of \na ROS inductor. We found higher ROS basal levels and reduced an -\ntioxidant capacity in MEF from LP embryos (p<0.05). Also, LP MEFs \nshowed a downregulation of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and \nsuperoxide dismutase. These results coincided with a downregu -\nlation of Sirtuin 3 and Sirtuin 7 in LP MEFs (p<0.05), both usually \nrepressed in senescence and involved in ROS-induced injury and \nDNA damage response, respectively. Finally, the expression of se -\nnescence-associated microRNAs was studied and we found an up -\nregulation of miR-26a in LP MEFs (p<0.05).\nWe propose that MEF from LP embryos undergo premature senes -\ncence which would be caused by an increased oxidative stress and \nseems to be epigenetically regulated by Sirt-3, Sirt-7 and miR-26a.\n107.

Oxidative stress damages biomolecules and \ntelomeres are particularly prone to be damaged, thus it is relevant \ntheir protection to avoid telomere dysfunction. We have previously \nshown that the level of TERRAs increased in response to oxidative \nstress as a mechanism of telomere protection. However, ROS have \nproven to be signalling molecules, and in this regard, we demon -\nstrated that physiologic increase of ROS in brown adipose tissue of \nmice exposed to cold also triggered the induction of TERRAs. Since \nit is well known that ROS increase during adipocyte differentiation, \nwe hypothesized that the expression level of TERRAs is induced \nduring adipogenesis to protect telomeres and possibly having other \npotential functions to be unveiled. Our preliminary results showed \nthat TERRAs were induced during adipogenesis. In order to test \ntelomere integrity during adipocyte differentiation, we analysed telo -\nmeres in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes prior and post-induction of differen -\ntiation by IIF labelling TRF1, a component of the sheltering complex \nin telomeres. We observed a punctate pattern of TRF1 staining that \nwas conserved throughout the process of differentiation. In addition, \nwe analysed DNA damage foci by IIF by labelling gH2AX, the his -\ntone variant H2AX phosphorylated on Serine 139 that is found at \nsites of DNA breaks. We observed a slight increase in gH2AX foci \nas adipogenesis proceeded, possibly due to physiologic ROS pro -\nduction. No colocalization was observed between gH2AX and TRF1 \nindicating no telomere-associated DNA damage foci (TAF) formation \nduring adipogenesis, indicating the maintenance of telome integrity. \nIn summary, we found that TERRAs were induced during the pro -\ncess of adipocyte differentiation possibly to protect telomers.\n108.

Rosario-Argentina.\nThe heterogeneous nature of asthma has been understood for de -\ncades, but this feature of the disease is becoming increasingly im -\nportant in the era of specific biologic therapy. Unfortunately, accurate \nbiomarkers for asthma phenotyping remain an unmet medical need. \ntRNA-derived fragments have been proposed as markers of differ -\nent diseases and among them, tiRNA are of particular interest since \nthey are produced under stress conditions. To test whether tiARNs \ncan be used to evaluate  asthma severity, 5\u2019 tiRNA Glu-CTC and 5\u2019 \ntiRNA Gly-GCC, two abundant tiRNAs in saliva, were quantified in \nsputum samples of patients (n=42, 13 healthy controls and 29 asth -\nmatics, 13 of which are severe cases). Their levels were assessed \nboth in cells obtained from the sample (mainly leukocytes) and in \nsputum supernatants. We found that 5\u2019 tiRNA Gly-GCC levels were \nsignificantly elevated only in supernatants from patients with severe \nasthma. This lack of correlation with what is observed in sputum \ncells suggests that tiRNAs could be secreted by the bronchial ep -\nithelium.\nSimilar results were obtained when we discriminated patients ac -\ncording to sputum inflammatory phenotype, where extracellular 5\u2019 \ntiRNAGly-GCC showed increased levels in eosinophilic infiltrates, a \nhallmark of severe patients. Interestingly, levels of this tiRNA were \nsignificantly correlated with the expression of angiogenin (ANG) in \ncirculating leukocytes. ANG is the enzyme responsible for tiRNA \nproduction through specific cleavage of tRNAs in their anticodon \nloop. High expression of ANG in blood samples from severe and eo-\nsinophilic patients indicates that this pathway is activated in asthma. \nIn line with these findings, levels of 5\u2019 tiRNA Gly-GCC and  ANG are positively correlated with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines \nsuch  as IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 in sputum. In sum, our  results contribute \nto shed light on the role of tiARNs  in the pathogenesis of asthma and \nsuggest the potential use  of 5\u2019tiRNA-Gly-GCC for its phenotyping.\n109.

School of Medicine (SM), National University of \nRosario (UNR)\nEndochondral growth progresses from the proliferation, maturation \nand hypertrophy of chondrocytes, organized in the ossification cen -\nters, to the mineralization of the cartilage matrix to form bone tissue. \nIt begins during fetal life and ends at the end of early adulthood. \nCartilage, as a complex system, is constituted by self-similar parts, \nwhich possess self-organizing capacity and fractal rhythm. Fractal -\nity can be analyzed through algorithms that determine the Fractal \nDimension(DF) and the Predictive Determination Coefficient(R\u00b2), \nwhich would indicate the irregular distribution of chondrocytes in \nspace and their capacity of adaptation and interaction with the en -\nvironment, respectively. The growth and development of the femur \nwas analyzed through the fractal study of the chondrocytic lineage, \nby means of the Box Counting Algorithm (ABC), in different vital \nstages. The units of analysis were 12 New Zealand 2 weeks fe -\nmale rabbits. Femoral samples were obtained from the 1st to the 6th \nmonth of life. The samples were decalcified, fixed and dehydrated, \nand longitudinal sections of the diaphyses were made and stained \nwith hematoxylin eosin. ABC was applied to digitized images of the \nfemur histological sections with FrakOut! software and the DF and \nR\u00b2 of chondrocyte cellularity (CC) were determined. The results \nwere expressed as Median(M) and Standard Deviation (\u00b1) of DF \nand R\u00b2 of CC. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient between DF(CC) and \nage in months was obtained. Results: DF(CC) was M= 1.66 \u00b1 0.06, \nwhile R\u00b2(CC)= 0.99 \u00b1 0. The correlation between DF(CC) and age \nwas obtained: r=(-)0.85 (p \u02c2 0.001). Conclusions: R2 values indicate \nextensive, sustained interaction of cells with each other and with the \ninterstitium, with the ability to accommodate possible variations in \nthe environment.

(071) EFFECT OF YERBA MATE  ( ILEX PARAGUARIEN -\nSIS) ON THE RESTORATION OF ETHANOL-INDUCED \nGASTRIC MUCOSA DAMAGE IN RATS\nAgostina Salvatelli1, Eloy Petroni1, Mar\u00eda del Luj\u00e1n Corbo2, \nMercedes Lombarte1,3, Lucas R Brun1,3, Ver\u00f3nica E Di Lo -\nreto1.\n1Laboratorio de Biolog\u00eda \u00d3sea, Facultad de ciencias M\u00e9di -\ncas, UNR. 2 C\u00e1tedra de Anatomia y Fisiolog\u00eda Patol\u00f3gicas. \nFacultad de ciencias M\u00e9dicas, UNR. 3CONICET\nThere is a popular belief that the consumption of yerba mate (YM) \ncauses symptoms of gastric distress (heartburn or gastritis). Howev -\ner, there is no scientific evidence in this regard. In previous experi -\nments, we have evaluated the effect of chronic consumption of YM \ninfusions on the gastric mucosa without finding signs of damage. \nWe wonder how the previous state of the mucosa would influence \nthe referred symptoms. The objective of this work was to study the \neffect of the ingestion of an infusion of YM on the restoration of the \ngastric mucosa of rats with a previous gastric injury due to ethanol \nconsumption.\nThirty-two fasted rats were administered 1 mL of 60% ethanol by \norogastric tube to produce damage and then a 10% ethanol solution \nwas supplied ad libitum  (E). In addition, a group of control animals \n(C) received only water and another, YM infusion (25 g/500 ml, 70 \n\u00b0C, 5 min), (n = 8 each). After 7 days, animals were sacrificed (n = \n8 each). E was discontinued in the remaining animals of group E (n \n= 24), they were separated and given water (E+W) or YM (E+YM). \nEuthanasia was performed at day 3 and 7, the stomachs were pro -\ncessed for histological evaluation of macro and microscopic lesions \nand the levels of lipoperoxidation were determined in homogenates \nof the mucosa.\nHistopathological analysis: C and YM showed a mucosa with normal \ncharacteristics both macro and microscopically. Group E evidenced \nloss of folds, edema and congestion. Microscopically, it presented \nslight distortion of the glandular lumens, disruption of the epithelial \nsurface and mild edema and congestion. After the suspension of \nE, both E+W and E+YM macroscopically showed a mucosa with \nnormal characteristics both at day 3 and 7. Microscopically, at day 3, \nboth groups presented mild edema and congestion, and completely \nnormalizing after day 7 of suspension of E. \nEvaluation of oxidative damage (mean \u00b1 SD): C: 0.26 \u00b1 0.04 nmolT -\nBARS / mg protein, YM: 0.17\u00b10.05*, E:0.35 \u00b10.09, ANOVA, Tuckey \npost test, *p <0.05 vs group E). Post-sacrifice: no differences were \nobserved at day 3 or 7. \nWe conclude that the administration of an infusion of YM did not \naffect the restoration of ethanol-induced gastric mucosa damage in \nrats. The presence of lower levels of lipoperoxidation in the group \ntreated with YM could indicate a beneficial effect that cannot be ob -\nserved histologically with the times used.\n112.

Taurolithocholate (TLC) is \nknown to be the most pro-oxidative bile salt. However, there is no \ndirect evidence that ROS production derived from TLC action is a \nmechanism involved in cholestasis pathogenesis. Herein, we eval -\nuated a possible role of ROS in the TLC- induced impairment of \nMrp2 activity.\nMethodology : ROS production was measured by the 2\u00b4,7\u00b4-dichloro -\nfluorescin-diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay in  primary culture rat hepato -\ncytes. Cells were exposed to TLC (2.5 \u00b5M)  at different times (5, 10, \n15 and 20 min) followed  by incubation with DCFH-DA (5 \u03bcM). On the \nother hand, isolated rat hepatocyte couplets (IRHC) were co-treat -\ned with TLC (2.5 \u00b5M) and antioxidants: vitamin C (VitC 100 \u00b5M) or \nmannitol (Man 60 mM) for 20 min. To analyze the TLC-induced ROS \ninvolvement in Mrp2 activity impairment, functional studies were car -\nried out by assessing the canalicular vacuolar accumulation of its \nsubstrate glutathione methylfluorescein (GMF).\nResults : (% of Control\u00b1SEM; n=3-5): TLC increased intracellu -\nlar ROS production in hepatocytes, reaching the maximum peak \nat 5 min (133\u00b17a) and rapidly returning to control levels at 10 min \n(102\u00b14). This transient production suggests the participation of ROS \nas signaling molecules. Pre-treatment of IRCH with both antioxi -\ndants prevented TLC- induced impairment of canalicular accumu -\nlation of GMF: TLC (67\u00b16a), TLC+VitC (92\u00b13b), TLC+Man (94\u00b17b), \npointing out ROS as possible modulators of Mrp2 internalization. \nap<0.05 vs  Control, bp<0.05 vs TLC.\nConclusion: TLC treatment induced transient rise in ROS levels \nwhich could be a key signaling component that contributes to the \naltered Mrp2 function found in cholestasis.\n113.

As.) , 80 (supl V): 67, 2020]. Now, we intended to locate \nNOX into this pathway. To achieve this goal, we employed two differ -\nent methodological approaches in primary-cultured rat hepatocytes \n(PCH) treated with E17G. First, we evaluated the ability of the NOX \ninhibitor apocynin (Apo) to prevent ERK 1/2 activation by measuring \nby western blotting (WB) its degree of phosphorylation. Additionally, \nwe tested the possibility that ERK 1/2 inhibition with the MEK inhib -\nitor PD98059 (PD) can avoid the ROS increase induced by E17G, \nassessed fluorometrically by the 2\u2019,7\u2019-dichlorofluorescin-diacetate \nassay, which correlates dichlorofluorescin (DCF) fluorescence in -\ntensity with intracellular ROS concentration. E17G (200 \u00b5M, 20 min) \nincreased by 54\u00b114% (154\u00b114, p<0.05 vs control, n=3) the amount \nof p-ERK 1/2, while pre-incubation of PCH with Apo (100 \u00b5M, 30 \nmin) showed the same degree of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, indicat -\ning that NOX activation is not necessary for E17G-induced ERK 1/2 \nactivation. Furthermore, pre-incubation of PCH with PD (5 \u00b5M, 15 \nmin) exhibited the same complete inhibitory effect as Apo on the ele -\nvation of intracellular ROS induced by E17G (200 \u00b5M, 15 min) [DCF \nintensity (% of control), Mean\u00b1SEM:E17G=140\u00b110%*, E17G+A -ABSTRACTS113\npo=95\u00b13%#, E17G+PD=85\u00b17%#; *p<0.05 vs control, #p<0.05 vs \nE17G, n=3-5], thus suggesting that MEK-ERK 1/2 activation by \nE17G is a prerequisite for NOX activation and intracellular ROS el -\nevation. These findings locate NOX downstream MEK-ERK 1/2 in \nthe E17G-induced, ROS-mediated pathway that contributes to the \nimpairment of canalicular transport in hepatocytes. \n114.

There is no therapy \nfor this condition. OCA is a potent FXR agonist used to treat human \ninflammatory chronic cholestasis. We ascertained here its anti -\ncholestatic mechanisms in LPS-induced cholestasis.\nMethods:  Male Wistar rats were randomized in Control, OCA (20 \nmg/Kg/day, i.p., 6 days), LPS (6.5 mg/Kg, i.p., last 2 days) and OC -\nA+LPS groups. Then, we assessed serum alkaline phosphatase \n(ALP), a surrogate of bile salt (BS) hepatic accumulation, and tauro -\ncholate-stimulated BS output (BSO). mRNA/protein  levels of Bsep \nand Mrp3 (apical and sinusoidal BS efflux pumps, respectively) and \nNtcp (BS uptake carrier) were assessed by either or both Real time \nPCR and Western blot. Bsep localization was assessed by immu -\nnohistochemistry followed by confocal microscopy and image anal -\nysis. The inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were measured \nin serum by ELISA.\nResults:  (*p<0.05 vs. control; #p<0.05 vs. LPS). OCA reduced ALP \n(U/L) in LPS-treated rats (193 \u00b1 18# vs. 338 \u00b1 72*), and improved \nBSO (nmol/g liver) (1274 \u00b1 152 vs. 896 \u00b1 86). This was due to an \nincrease in the % of Bsep in the apical membrane (104 \u00b1 13# vs. \n52 \u00b1 9*), a finding confirmed by image analysis of confocal images \n(p<0.001). OCA also halted the elevations (pg/ml) of TNF-\u03b1 (266 \u00b1 \n56*# vs. 860 \u00b1 153*) and IL-1\u03b2 (13 \u00b1 2# vs. 52 \u00b1 8*). Neither the drop \nin Ntcp (46 \u00b1 11* vs. 52 \u00b1 9*) nor the increase in Mrp3 (279 \u00b1 29* vs. \n299 \u00b1 60*) expression induced by LPS (% of control) was affected.\nConclusions:  LPS impairs BSO, leading to BS accumulation \n(cholestasis). OCA prevented this by improving apical Bsep localiza -\ntion and the subsequent BSO; the adaptive BS urinary elimination \nafforded by the impaired uptake and the increased sinusoidal efflux \nof BSs was maintained. Counteraction of cytokine elevations may \nbe crucial for OCA beneficial effects.\n115.

Then, they were exposed to chloromethylfluorescein \ndiacetate (2.5 \u00b5M, 15 min), converted intracellularly into glutathione \nmethylfluorescein (GMF), Mrp2 substrate. Finally, Mrp2 activity was \nestimated by the percentage of IRHCs that accumulated GMF in the \ncanalicular vesicle (cVA).\nResults: (% of control \u00b1 SE): IL-1\u00df significantly reduced Mrp2 ac -\ntivity (cVA: IL-1\u00df=65\u00b15%a).

Positively correlation between SPARC, \nIL1b, NLRP3 and casp1 were shown. Ontology analysis revealed \nthat genes that positively correlate with SPARC in NASH were in -\nvolved in innate immune pathways. In a murine diet-induced NAFLD \nmodel SPARC+/+ and SPARC-/- mice were fed with high fat diet for 12 \n(steatosis) or 20 weeks (NASH), we observed that the absence of \nSPARC attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome-related gene expression. \nIn vitro  studies on primary hepatocyte cultures from SPARC-/-mice, \nshowed decrease expression of IL1 b and casp1 in response to free \nfatty acid. Macrophage cell line, primary Kupffer and hepatocyte cul -\ntures were incubated with free fatty acids and SPARC to assess \neffect on inflammasome-related gene expression, IL1 b secretion \nand casp1 activity. SPARC increased IL1 b and casp1 expression \nand secretion. SPARC alone or in combination with fatty acid trigger \nNLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our results suggest a key role of \nSPARC as a damage-associated molecular patterns in NAFLD pro -\ngression.  \n117.

III), 2021114\nBackground and aims  cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a heteroge -\nneous group of malignancies arising from cholangiocytes with very \npoor prognosis. It is essential to investigate the molecular pathogen -\nesis of CCA to identify new potential therapeutic targets. During the \nlast decades, the association between the aquaporin-1 (AQP1) wa -\nter-channel expression and tumor behavior has been investigated in \nseveral cancer types but in CCA, remains unknown. Our aim was to \nbegin studying the role of AQP1 in CCA progression. Materials and \nmethods: bioinformatic analysis was performed to determine cor -\nrelationsbetween AQP1 and overall survival in human intrahepatic \nCCA samples. AQP1 KO HuCCT1 CCA cells were generated by us -\ning the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Cell proliferation and migration stud -\nies were performed by using Incucyte live-cell imaging system. We \nalso performed an unbiased discovering experiment using Next-gen -\neration sequencing technique (RNAseq), comparing wild-type and \nAQP1 KO CCA cells. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), \nreceptors and molecular signaling pathways were evaluated by \nRT-qPCR, Western-Blot and confocal immunofluorescence micros -\ncopy. Results: there was a positive correlation between AQP1 and \noverall survival in human CCA. AQP1 KO significantly induced prolif -\neration and migration of CCA cells. RNAseq showed a total of 2702 \ndifferentially expressed genes upon AQP1 KO in HuCCT1 cells. The \nIngenuity Pathway Analysis showed cancer, cellular movement, and \ncellular growth and proliferation as the top affected Diseases and \nBiological functions. AQP1 silencing was associated with an EMT \nphenotype, i.e., downregulation of epithelial (e.g., E-cadherin) and \nupregulation of mesenchymal (e.g., Vimentin) markers, and showed \ndifferential activation of intracellular pathways involved in tumor pro -\ngression (i.e., IGF2/IR/IGF1R and Hippo). Conclusion : Our data \nsuggest that AQP1plays an important role driving CCA progression, \nespecially, in the dissemination of the tumor cells.\n118.

The \naim of this work was to develop a specific targeting for hepatocellu -\nlar carcinoma (HCC) therapy. \nThe therapeutic efficacy of enzymatically synthetized rutino -\nsyl-4-methylumbelliferone (4MUR), which expose rhamnose as \na terminal unit, was analyzed in vitro . 4MUR showed a significant \nanti-proliferative effect on liver tumoral cells (Huh7 IC50 = 488 \u00b5M), \nas compared to non-tumoral cells (IHH IC50 >2000 \u00b5M) and hepatic \nstellate cells (CFSC-2G IC50 >2000 \u00b5M) in a dose-dependent man -\nner (p<0.05) .The mechanistic bases of 4MUR selective target to \nliver tumor cells was evaluated by the interaction with asialoglyco -\nprotein receptor (ASGPR), the expression of hyaluronan synthases \n(HAS2 or HAS3) and hyaluronan deposition. We demonstrated that \nASGPR are overexpressed in liver tumoral cells and 4MUR is incor -\nporated via interaction with these receptors. 4MUR-treatment de -\ncreased the levels of HAS2 and HAS3 and the cytoplasmic deposi -\ntion of hyaluronan. Finally, to determinate 4MUR effect on CFSC-2G \nactivation, the expression of the profibrotic-related genes \u03b1-SMA, \nTGF-\u03b2, COLI A2, TIMP-1 and the antifibrogenic gene MMP-2 was \nevaluated. We found that these genes were upregulated, while \nMMP-2 was not affect. \nAltogether these insights provide evidence that 4MUR is a potential \nantitumoral drug that presents targeting capability, without damag -\ning non-tumoral cells. \n119.

Currently the impact of donor age \non liver transplantation is subject of debate. Particularly, there is no \npublished data about the use of organs from elderly donors in our \ncountry. Objective:  Studying the impact of donor age in the clinical \noutcome of liver transplant (LTx) patients at the Hospital Universitar -\nio Fundaci\u00f3n Favaloro. Methodology:  A retrospective cohort study \nof 493 LTx (period 2009 -2020) in HUFF was performed. Patients \nwere grouped into different categories based on donor age, \u226518-39 \n(Young, Y), 40-59 (Adults, A), \u226560 years (Elderly, E). Results:  After \napplying the exclusion criteria, a total of 279 donors were included \n(94 Y, 136 A and 49 E). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed reduced sur -\nvival rate of adults and elderly patients who were transplanted using \nE livers in contrast with the younger grafts (log-rank.test, p<0.05). \nThe postoperative liver tests were analyzed during the first week \npost-Tx. Levels of both hepatocellular (ALT, AST, ALP) and choles -\ntatic (TBIL) markers were lower (p<0.05) in patients with E livers \n(n=9) compared with the A group (n=14). To study the effect of donor \nallograft age on recipient\u2019s alloimmune responses, the frequency of \nacute cellular rejection (ACR) during the first-year post-Tx was de -\ntermined by analyzing the histopathological reports in Y (n=27), A \n(n=32) and E (n=27) donor groups. Increasing donor age was asso -\nciated with an increased rate of ACR (p>0.05, ns). Histopathological \ndiagnosis of ACR was found in 30% of E, 25% of A and 15% of Y \ndonor group. In addition, E recipients presented a lower rate of ACR \ncompared with A recipients (36% vs. 11%; significant relationship \nbetween ACR and Recipient group was detected, p<0.05), inde -\npendently of graft age (AD-AR (44%) vs AD-ER (6%), p<0.05; YD-\nAR (20%) vs YD-ER (8%), p>0.05; ED-AR (45%) vs ED-ER (19%), \np>0.05). Conclusion:  Our results indicate that the use of E donors \nwas associated with reduced long-term survival rate, increased rate \nof ACR during the first year post-Tx; despite having lower initial he -\npatocellular and cholestatic injury than younger donors.\n120.

Ghrelin is an orexigenic hor -\nmone mostly synthetized in the stomach, which we demonstrated to \nbe lower in serum from Helicobacter pylori infected patients.  Serum \npepsinogen I (PGI) and II (PGII) have been associated with the to -\npography of gastric pathology. To achieve our general aim of finding \npotential biomarkers of gastric pathology, the objective of this study \nwas to determine serum concentrations of ghrelin and pepsinogens \nI and II in H. pylori  infected and uninfected patients with different \ntypes of gastric pathology. The protocol included samples from \ndyspeptic adults (18-70y) referred for an upper gastrointestinal en -ABSTRACTS115\ndoscopy to the Hospital de Gastroenterolog\u00eda \u201cDr. Carlos Bonorino \nUdaondo\u201d. Histopathology and H. pylori  diagnosis were evaluated \nfrom gastric biopsies. Serum ghrelin concentration, PGI and PGII \nwere measured by ELISA. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney tests \nwere applied.  Thirty-five individuals were included to date, 77.1% \nfemale, with an age of 40.2\u00b113.0y. H. pylori  prevalence was 71.4% \n(CI95% 54.9-83.7%). Median ghrelin levels were 396.0 pg/ml (IQR \n315.0-501.0); PGI, 45.1 ng/ml (IQR 29.5-55.7); PGII, 3.3 ng/ml (IQR \n2.0-6.0); PGI/PGII 11.0 (8.0-16.7). PGI and PGII were significant -\nly higher for H. pylori  infected compared to non-infected patients \n(P=0.014 and P=0.0001, respectively); however, PGI/PGII ratio did \nnot differ between both groups ( P=0.14). Serum PGII differed signifi -\ncantly between normal mucosa, chronic inactive and active gastritis \nof the antrum and corpus ( P=0.003 and P=0.049, respectively), be -\ning higher in the presence of gastric pathology. These preliminary \nresults suggest that the measured biochemical variables might be \nuseful as potential biomarkers of gastric pathology; further analysis \nafter inclusion of the total sample size for this protocol is needed to \nconfirm these findings.     \n121.

There is grow -\ning evidence that IBS or IBS-like symptoms could be a prodrome \nbefore diagnosis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease or can be observed \nin IBD patients in remission. Its treatment is challenging and use of \nalternative medicines, especially herbal therapies is increasing. In \nthis sense, Passiflora caerulea (PC), a native plant that previously \nshowed to possess beneficial properties in preclinical models relat -\ned to Inflammatory Bowel Disease was studied.                              Male \nSprague Dawley rats weighing 210 \u2013230 g were used. Four groups \nof animals (n=6) were treated with PC (250 and 500 mg/Kg), clonaz -\nepam (Clo) 1 mg/Kg or water during four days (S). In the fifth day \nthese groups were restrained using a plastic rodent restrainer. \nControl group (C) were not subjected to stress. Immediately after \n6 hours, blood was collected and colon and ileon were removed for \nposterior analysis. Exposure to acute immobilization produced an \nincrease in plasmatic corticosterone level (S: 487.4\u00b1193.8 ng/mL, \nC: 118.2\u00b128.9) and a slight increase in blood glucose. These effects \nwere reduced by treatment with PC (250 mg/Kg: 195.5\u00b126.5, 500 \nmg/Kg: 74.25\u00b114.4) and reference drug (Clo: 244.0\u00b120.1). Redox \nstatus expressed as GSH:GSSG ratio was increased in ileon and \ncolon in S groups, meanwhile the extract significantly reduced this \neffect only in ileon. Histopalogical analysis showed that goblet cells \nwere depleted by immobilization in ileon and colon and both doses \nof extract in ileon and only higher dose in colon ameliorated these \neffects. Western blot analysis showed that P53 and caspase-3 pro -\nteins were increased in ileon and colon of stressed animals, mean -\nwhile PC reduced both parameters in both portions of intestine. \nThese observations suggested that PC could represent a promising \ntreatment to improve gastrointestinal health in stressful conditions.\nGEN\u00c9TICA\n122.

It is \ncharacterized by the large number of genes involved (more than \n100) and its phenotype heterogeneity. Despite the wide genetic vari -\nety of hearing impairment, the most commonly mutated genes in se -\nvere to profound autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss \nare GJB2  and GJB6 , accounting for nearly 50% of the cases in most \npopulations around the Mediterranean Sea.

TP53  (Tumor protein P53 ) \ngene deletions and mutations constitute important prognostic and \npredictive factors associated to poor outcome in CLL, with rele -\nvance in clinical decisions. We evaluated TP53  alterations in 218 \nCLL patients (131 men; mean age: 64.9 years, range: 35-87 years; \nRAI clinical stages: 0: 36%; I-II: 47.1%; III-IV: 16.9%), to analyze \ntheir frequency, distribution and association with prognostic fac -\ntors of the disease. PCR and bidirectional Sanger sequencing to \nevaluate IGHV ( immunoglobulin heavy variable region ) and TP53  \nmutational status were used. Cytogenetic and FISH ( Fluorescence \nin situ hybridization ) analysis were performed. The study was ap -\nproved by the Local Ethics Committee. All individuals gave their \ninformed consent. Twenty-nine patients (13.3%) had TP53  aberra -\ntions. Deletion 17p13 [del(17p)] was observed in 26 cases (12%); \n3 patients showed only TP53  mutations ( TP53 -M), and 10 cases \nhad TP53 deletion and mutation. Two deletions and two insertions \n(3 frameshifts) (26.7%), and 11 point mutations (73.4%) (1 at the \nsplicing site and 10 missense), were found; 86.6% variants were \nlocated in the DNA-binding domain (exons 4-8). Cases with TP53 -M \nshowed significantly higher mean percentages of leukemic cells with \ndel(17p) (33.5%) than those with unmutated TP53  (12%) (p=0.016). \nTP53 -M patients showed association with unmutated IGHV (87.5% \ncases) and chromosome alterations (88.9%), including complex \nkaryotypes. Similar clinical behavior between cases with del(17p) MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021116\nand those with TP53 -M was found. To our knowledge, this is the \nfirst evaluation of TP53  aberrations in a large series of CLL patients \nin our country. Our findings show high genomic instability in these \ncases, provide information about the molecular heterogeneity of this \ndisease, and reinforce the importance to evaluate TP53  aberrations \nto optimize patient stratification and outcome.\n124.

IBD includes ulcerative colitis \n(UC) and Crohn disease (CD). In the present study we aim to de -\nscribe the unknown gut microbiota of IBD-patients in comparison \nwith healthy individuals of the Argentine population in order to find \nnovel IBD biomarkers in our region. METHODS: We evaluated 40 \nnon-IBD-controls, 20 UC-patients and 14 CD-patients from the met-\nropolitan area of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Fecal DNA was extracted \nand hypervariable regions V3-V4 of the bacterial 16SR-gene were \nsequenced using a MiSeq-Platform. Sequences were analyzed \nwith the QIIME2 environment. Differential functional pathways were \nevaluated using PICRUSt. RESULTS: Beta diversity was signifi -\ncantly different between groups (UniFrac distances PERMANOVA \np-value <0.05). In UC-patients we found no significant differences \nin alpha diversity compared to CD and non-IBD-control. However, \ndifferences in alpha diversity were found in CD compared to con -\ntrols (Shannon q=0.04). The genus Paraprevotella was found to be \noverrepresented in UC compared to CD. Our analyzes  also indicate \nthat the genus Lactobacillus has a higher representation  in the CD \ngroup while the genus Fusicantenibacter is more represented in the \ncontrols. Finally, functional pathways were  analyzed finding that CD \nhas different metabolic capabilities compared to  the control group. \nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study provides new knowledge  on the \ngut microbiota composition of our population, allowing the  associa -\ntion of local changes in  gut microbial diversity in UC  and CD. These \nnovel findings would enable personalized therapies development \nthrough the use of metagenomic profiles of the Argentine population.\n125.

To perform the clinical-molecular characterization of 7 patients \nwith mtDNA DS.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:  Clinical data from 7 patients diag -\nnosed with DS were analyzed. The \u201ccommon deletion\u201d (CD) in mtD -\nNA (m.4977del) was determined by Long-PCR. Other deletions and \nthe level of heteroplasmy were studied by Multiplex Ligation-depen -\ndent Probe Amplification (MLPA). The breakpoints of deletions were determined by Sanger sequencing.\nRESULTS : 3 patients with SKS, 2 PEO and 2 PS were identified \n(age range: 0.5- 11 years). The most frequent clinical manifesta -\ntions were PEO and short stature. All patients presented high lactic \nacid levels in plasma/urine. The 4 available muscle biopsies (MB) \nshowed red-ragged fibers. Molecular studies showed the CD in 3 \npatients with SKS. Larger deletions (6,927-7,436bp), with a hetero -\nplasmy range of 25-78%, were found in the other 4 cases. In 3 pa -\ntients, the deletion was detected in peripheral blood (PB) and in 4 of \nthem in MB. The m.8637_16072del deletion in a patient with PS was \ndetected by MLPA in PB and further studied in PB, buccal mucosa \nand urine samples by long-PCR. Type-1 deletions associated with \nrepetitive sequences were detected in 6 patients and 3 deletions \nhad not been previously reported. \nCONCLUSIONS:  The severity of the disease showed no relation \nwith the size or type of the deletion in this group of patients. The \nimplementation of Long-PCR and MLPA allowed the diagnosis of \npatients with DS in non-invasive samples, leaving MB as a 2nd-\nline-study. A thorough clinical characterization and these molecular \nstudies are key steps for reaching the definitive diagnosis of patients \nwith mtDNA DS. \n126.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy \n(DMD) is the most common and represents the most severe form. \nAlthough most of the alterations that occur in the DMD  gene affect \ncoding areas, ~ 7% are found in splicing regions. It is difficult to pre -\ndict the effect that these variants will have on the splicing process.\nWe present the case of an 8-year-old boy with dystrophinopathy, \nbiopsy with preserved dystrophin and a NGS study where the proba -\nbly pathogenic variant DMD: c.4519-2A> C (exon 33) was identified. \nOur aim was to analyze the consequence of the splicing acceptor \nsite variant at the mRNA level.\nMuscle mRNA was extracted and cDNA was synthesized. Long-\nrange and nested PCRs of exons flanking the variant were per -\nformed and sequenced by Sanger.\nTwo isoforms of different molecular weight were observed. The most \nabundant with the highest molecular weight (A) had a 14bp deletion, \nwhile the less abundant with lower molecular weight (B) had a exon \n33 complete deletion. The sequencing allowed the prediction that A \nwould produce a frameshift (FS) with the appearance of a premature \ntranslation codon, leading to the absence of dystrophin protein. On \nthe other hand, it is expected that FS will not be produced in B and a \nshorter dystrophin protein will be generated. This finding agrees with \nimmunohistochemistry where DYS 1, 2 and 3 domains were pre -\nserved. The presence of isoform B, which product would generate a \nshorter but partially functional dystrophin, would explain the milder \ncondition observed in the patient.\nIn conclusion, the mRNA study allowed corroborating the deleteri -\nous impact of the variant at the splicing level, allowing the correlation \nbetween the splicing alteration, the dystrophin isoforms, the biopsy \nresult, and the patient\u2019s clinical manifestations.\n127. (323) DIFFERENTIAL MOLECULAR ALGORITHM FOR \nDUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY. COMPARATIVE \nSTUDY OF LATIN AMERICA MUTATION FREQUENCIES \nWITH THERAPEUTIC TARGET\nCarcione, Micaela1,2; Mazzanti, Chiara1,2;Luce, Leonela1,2; Gi-\nliberto, Florencia1,2*.\n1 Laboratorio de Distrofinopat\u00edas, C\u00e1tedra de Gen\u00e9tica, Fa -\ncultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Universidad de Buenos \nAires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.ABSTRACTS117\n2 Instituto de Inmunolog\u00eda, Gen\u00e9tica y Metabolismo (INI -\nGEM), CONICET - Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos \nAires, Argentina.\nDystrophinopathies cover a spectrum of rare progressive X-linked \nmuscle diseases, arising from DMD  mutations. They are among the \nmost common neuromuscular diseases, being Duchenne Muscular \nDystrophy (DMD) the most severe form. Despite that there is still no \ncure for these diseases, advances are being made for the develop -\nment of DMD therapies. Some are already approved: exon skipping \nand premature stop codon read-through (Ataluren). We aimed to \ncharacterize the mutational spectrum of DMD  in an Argentinian co -\nhort, to identify candidates for available treatments and, to conduct \na comparative analysis of the Latin American (LA) frequencies of \nmutations amenable for available DMD therapies. \nWe studied 400 patients with dystrophinopathy, implementing a \ndiagnostic algorithm including: MLPA/PCR/Sanger/Exome/in-silico \npanels and bioinformatics. We performed a meta-analysis of LA\u2019s \nmetrics for DMD available therapies. The algorithm resulted effec -\ntive for achieving differential diagnosis, reaching a 97% detection \nrate.  Therefore, 371 patients with genetic confirmation of dystroph -\ninopathy resulted candidates for corticosteroid treatment, 20 were \neligible for exon skipping of exon 51, 21 for exon 53, 12 for exon \n45 and another 70 for Ataluren. We determined that 87.5% of DMD \npatients will restore the reading frame with the skipping of only one \nexon. According to the meta-analysis, only 4 LA countries (Argenti -\nna, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico) complete the molecular algorithm \nfor dystrophinopathies. In conclusion, this manuscript describes the \ntheragnosis carried out in Argentinian dystrophinopathy patients. \nThe implemented molecular algorithm proved to be efficient for the \nachievement of differential diagnosis, which plays a crucial role in \npatient management, determination of standard of care and genet -\nic counselling. Finally, this work contributes with the international \nefforts to characterize the frequencies and variants of LA, pillars of \ndrug development and theragnosis. \n128.

Pre -\ndisposition to RB is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with \n90% penetrance. However, some RB families included unaffected \ncarriers indicating low penetrance (LP). Our aim was to study the \nfamilies with LP retinoblastoma and detect the asymptomatic carri -\ners. RB1 mutations were identified by sequencing, MLPA assay and \nhaplotype analysis. We reviewed the analyses of 18 families, 15 of \nthem segregated with high-penetrance (HP) mutations and 3 with \nlow-penetrance (LP) mutations. In addition, 4 families with sporadic \nRB patients included unaffected mutation-carrier relatives. The HP \nfamilies included 5 unilateral, 26 bilateral patients and 2 unaffect -\ned carriers, the mean diseased eye ratio (DER) was 1.74. The LP \nfamilies included 27 germline carriers of which 8 were unilateral, \n3 bilateral, 1 had retinoma, 1 was a mutation mosaic and 14 were \nunaffected, the mean DER was 0.54. The parental origin of mutant \nallele was documented in 20 germline carriers: 15 carriers received \nthe mutation from their father and 5 from their mother. Seven carri -\ners of father\u00b4s mutant allele were affected, 7 carriers were unaffect -\ned and 1 developed a retinoma. Four carriers of mother\u00b4s mutation \ndeveloped RB and 1 was unaffected. The mutations identified in LP \nfamilies were: 2 in promoter, 2 missense, 1 in splicing site and 1 \nRB1 gene deletion. These mutations cause less pRB protein or less \nfunctional pRB or decrease cell viability and tumor development. \nOur results show that the survey of 18 RB families and sporadic RB \ncases revealed 7 families with 15 unaffected mutation carriers, what \nindicates a LP of RB. Detection of unaffected carriers is of utmost \nimportance to assess the risk to their offspring. The parental origin \nof LP mutations defines the penetrance of hereditary RB and allows to delve into molecular bases of LP retinoblastoma. \n129.

Garrahan\u201d\nMitochondrial diseases (MD) are a group of disorders caused by \npathogenic variants in mitochondrial (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA \n(nDNA) that primarily affect oxidative phosphorylation.\nAims:  to perform the molecular characterization of a pediatric pa -\ntient cohort with clinical diagnosis of MD, by Next-generation Se -\nquencing (NGS) of nDNA genes.\nMethods:  We included 35 patients based on clinical, biochemical, \nneuroimaging and pathologic findings from a total of 119 patients \nwith suspected MD and negative for the \u201ccommon\u201d deletion and fre -\nquent mtDNA variants. nDNA variants were studied using a MD-cus -\ntomized NGS capture panel (24); or by exome sequencing (11).\nResults: nDNA pathogenic variants were identified in 13 unrelat -\ned patients (37%, panel=6, exome=7), and our custom panel gave \na diagnostic yield of 25%. Six patients with Leigh syndrome had \nvariants in SURF1 (3), PDHA1 (2) or COQ4 (1); three patients with \nmitochondrial hepatopathy in POLG (2) or MPV17 (1); one patient \nwith cavitating leukoencephalopathy in NDUFS1 ; one patient with \nmyoclonic epilepsy and tubulopathy in PC; one patient with myopa -\nthy in TK2, and one patient with optic atrophy plus in OPA1 . Ten out \nof the 23 variants found were novel . Seven were truncating (3 SNV, \n3 indels and 1 deep intronic variant) and the rest were missense. In \nmost cases the variants were biallelic, except for MPV17 (homozy -\ngous), and PDHA1 (hemizygous, one mosaic). \nConclusions : The diagnostic yield obtained highlights the advan -\ntages of an NGS panel approach for MD. While the exome seems \nmore efficient, it is worth noting that all the variants were found in \ngenes that are included in our panel and would have also been de -\ntected with it. Remarkably, the deep intronic variant in OPA1  was \nfound by Sanger sequencing after an exhausting literature review of \nthe missense variant detected by NGS, emphasizing the limitations \nof panels and exomes and the relevance of an interdisciplinary work.\n130.

Hospital de Pediatr\u00eda J. P. Garrahan.\nIntroduction: Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) comprise hetero -\ngeneous and rare monogenic disorders with a variety of overlapping \nor unspecific clinical phenotypes. Diagnosis of an IEM is supported \nby clinical suspicion and biochemical studies and is confirmed by \nmolecular analysis. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a valuable \ntool, allowing the analysis of various genes simultaneously. This \nminimizes the turnaround time, which is crucial for some IEMs. The \naim of the study was to evaluate the performance of targeted NGS in \nconfirming the diagnosis of IEMs in a clinical setting. Materials and \nMethods: 124 patients with clinical and biochemical suspicion of IEM \nwere analyzed between July 2019 and August 2021 with a custom \nNGS panel of 87 genes. Bioinformatics tools were applied to detect \nand prioritize small variants, and to predict copy number variations. \nResults: Global diagnosis rate was 73%, but when dividing patients \naccording to their previous studies, in those with a defined biochem -\nical and clinical suspicion the diagnostic yield was 90%, meanwhile \nwhen previous findings were not conclusive, it was 26% (p< 0.0001). \nA total of 113 variants related to the clinical suspicion of the patients \nin 31 genes were identified: 42% were absent from population and \ndisease-based databases; nevertheless, 75% of them could be clas -\nsified as pathogenic or probably pathogenic, according to the ACMG \nconsensus criteria. Only 12 variants were identified in more than one \npatient. Conclusions: NGS technology applied to this cohort of pa -\ntients provided a high diagnostic rate and a better knowledge of the \nmolecular basis of IEMs in our population.  It also evidenced the high \nallelic heterogeneity and the low representation of local variants in \ngenetic databases. A genetic diagnosis is determinant for the treat -\nment of these patients. The optimal use of targeted NGS is achieved \nwhen clinical and biochemical characterization of the patients allows \nidentification of candidate genes.\n132. (579) ROLE OF VARIANTS OF ABCG2  GENE IN THE \nTRIGGERING OF PORPHYRIA CUTANEA TARDA IN \nHIV-INFECTED INDIVIDUALS\nBuscalia, Maria Laura(1); Zuccoli, Romina Johanna(1); Melito, \nViviana(1,2); Parera, Victoria & Buzaleh, Ana Maria(1,2)\n(1) Centro de Investigaciones Sobre Porfirinas y Porfirias ( CI-\nPYP), Hospital de Clinicas, UBA-CONICET\n(2) Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica, Facultad de Cien -\ncias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires\nPorphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT) is caused by a deficiency in Uro -porphyrinogen decarboxylase; there are 2 main types of PCT: \nhereditary and acquired. Xenobiotics, alcohol, abuse drugs, hor -\nmones and hepatotropic viruses are the main triggering factors \nof this hepatic disease. In our country, 16% of PCT patients are \nHIV infected individuals. Genetic variants affect the expression \nof the ABCG2  transporter, altering the efflux of drugs and heme; \nNM_004827.3:c.34G>A, and NM_004827.3:c.421C>A are present \nin a high frequency. Previously, the influence of ABCB1 genetic \nvariants, a transporter of the same family as ABCG2 , in the onset \nof PCT in HIV carriers was reported. The aim was to evaluate the \nrole of the NM_004827.3:c.421C>A (rs2231142) variant of ABCG2 \ngene in the association PCT-HIV. A population of control (n=33), \nHIV (n=33), PCT (n=35) and PCT-HIV (n=42) individuals was stud -\nied. Genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP. The non-wild type allele \nA was in a very low frequency in all the groups. In PCT-HIV, the \nfrequency of A (0.16) was higher than PCT (0.07, p<0.001) and HIV \n(0.06, p<0.001) values. When genotypic frequencies were analyzed, \nhigher values for heterozygosis SNV (CA) in PCT-HIV group (40%, \np<0.05) than PCT (26%) and HIV (21%) were found;all of them \nsignificantly higher than Controls (CA=4.35%). The AA genotype \n(2%) was only found in PCT-HIV group. These results, suggest that \nNM_004827.3:c.421C>A variant in the ABCG2 gene could be relat -\ned to PCT/HIV association. The analysis of NM_004827.3:c.34G>A \nSNV, will allow us to establish the presence or absence of risk hap -\nlotypes in the manifestation of PCT associated or not with HIV in -\nfection. The results of this analysis, together with those previously \nobtained for ABCB1 drug transporter gene variants, will enable us \nto further conclude about a risk haplotype for PCT triggering. Due to \nthe multifactorial nature of porphyria onset, they are of great value \nto understand the susceptibility to develop PCT.\n133.

Thyroid cancer is the most prevalent endocrine malignancy, \nand the relevance of fibroblasts (Fb) and EVs in the TME is begin -\nning to be elucidated. Using an in vitro model, we demonstrated \nthat Fb-thyroid tumor cell co-culture induced the activity of matrix \nmetalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), and that the EVs obtained from these \ncultures stimulated the secretion and activation of MMP2 by normal \nFb. Given this background, we hypothesized that the interaction of \nthyroid tumor cells with Fb would promote modifications in the EVs\u2019 \nprotein cargo, which would influence their communication with the \nTME components. Besides, EVs would enable the study of poten -\ntial biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of the evolution in \ncancer patients. The bioinformatic analysis of EV-proteomic data \nidentified 1977 proteins; 98% of EV-protein cargo and 97 out of 100-\nmost frequent proteins in Vesiclepedia database were identified in \nour samples, thus confirming the identity and purity of the EVs sam -\nples analyzed. Furthermore, we demonstrated that EVs released \nfrom Fb-thyroid tumor cell co-culture expressed a proteomic profile \nrelated with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Specifically, the \ncrosstalk between Fb and a papillary thyroid cancer cell line (TPC-1) \nenhanced the functionality of EVs for collagen degradation. Consis -\ntently, MMP2 and its related proteins, detected in EVs, allowed to \ndiscriminate between EVs from tumoral and non-tumoral contexts. \nFinally, the proteins HRAS and MAMDC2 that were found to be en -\nriched in EVs from Fb-TPC-1 co-culture, constitute interesting tar -\ngets for further studies as cancer biomarkers. In conclusion, EVs \nproduced in the thyroid tumor milieu participate in ECM remodeling, ABSTRACTS119\npromoting the synthesis and local activation of MMPs, facilitating \nECM-degradation as well as tumor aggressiveness and progres -\nsion.\nHEMATOLOG\u00cdA\n134.

Reactive oxygen species production \nand oxidative environment have an impact on all blood cell lineages. \nThe aim was to evaluate, at transcriptional and proteomic levels, the \npro-oxidative and anti-oxidative status in BTT patients. A descriptive \nstudy was performed with 66 subjects (40 apparently healthy and \n26 with BTT). Real-time PCR was used for gene expression anal -\nyses of transcription factors forkhead homeobox typeO (FOXO3a) \nand nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor-2 (NRF2); antioxidant \nenzymes: catalase (CAT), peroxiredoxin-2 (PRX-2), superoxide \ndismutase (SOD); and cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6. Quantitative mass \nspectrometry was performed on cytosol erythrocyte membranes \ndepleted of hemoglobin. Bioinformatic analysis was performed with \nPerseus, BlastKoala and Proteome Discoverer V1.4 programs. \nRelative expression of NRF2 was 4.7-fold higher in BTT than in \ncontrol group, whereas FOXO3a expression was similar in both. \nTranscriptional expression of SOD, PRDX2 and proinflammatory cy -\ntokines were significantly upregulated in BTT compared to controls \n(p<0,005). Proteomic study showed significant difference in abun -\ndances of oxidative stress and inflammation markers such as lipox -\nygenase15 (ALOX15), poly-C-binding protein 1/2 (PCBP 1/2), P40/\nP67 subunit of NADPH oxidase and 70 kilodalton heat shock protein \n(HSP70), tyrosine-protein kinase (SYK) in BTT ( p\u02c20, 05). Proteins \ninvolved in redox imbalance protection such as glutathione S-trans -\nferase kappa1 (GST\u03ba1), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) and \nglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) were higher in BTT \nthan in controls (4.2, 4.1 and 2.1 fold respectively). These results \nshowed changes in the gene expression of some redox regulators \ntogether with modifications in the erythrocyte proteome generated \nby the global redox imbalance underlying in this pathology.\n135.

The aim of \nthis work was determine the behavior of redox and inflammatory \nbiomarkers at transcriptional and systemic level in acute leukemia \n(AL) patients at the time of onset. Between 2016\u20132021, 61 AL pa -\ntients and 63 controls (C) were evaluated. AL characterization was \nperformed by blood count, cytochemistry and flow cytometry. Anti -\noxidant enzymes catalase  (CAT), and superoxide dismutase  (SOD), \nand the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha  (TNF-\u03b1) and interleu -\nkine-6  (IL-6) gene expression were analyzed with qPCR in periph -\neral white blood cells. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and CAT and \nSOD enzymatic activity were determined in serum by spectrophoto -metric methods. Cytokines concentration were measured by Human \nTNF-\u03b1 and Human IL-6 ELISA. Statistical analyses were performed \nby SPSS V.25 statistical software and were considered significant \nat p<0,05.  We detected 41% of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), \n44% acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 15% acute promyelocyt -\nic leukemia (APL). A significant increased level of lipoperoxidation \nwas found in AML and APL respect to C [MDA \u00b5mol/L: AML=1,07 \n(0,40\u20136,60); ALP=1,22 (0,54\u20132,96); C=0,83 (0,33\u20132,51)]. Also, AML \nand APL showed higher CAT activity than C [CAT nmol/mg prot: \nAML=0,47 (0,02\u20133,62); ALP=0,70 (0,18\u20130,99); C=0,25 (0,08\u20132,15)], \nwhile SOD activity was a similar behavior between the groups stud -\nied. Furthermore, IL-6 concentration was significantly increased in \nall AL patients respect to C. SOD and IL-6 transcriptional expres -\nsion were significantly downregulated in AL patients. No statistical -\nly significant differences were found in the other genes expression \nstudied. These findings show the imbalance of redox and inflamma -\ntory biomarkers in the different AL evaluated and highlight on the \ndifferential behavior observed at the transcriptional/systemic level \nunderlying in this neoplasm.\n136. (288) REGULATION OF HEPCIDIN BY ERYTHROPOIETIN \nIN MACROPHAGES\nIolster J, Maltaneri R, Nesse A, Vittori D, Chamorro ME.\n Universidad de Buenos Aires. Consejo Nacional de Investi -\ngaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas. Instituto del Departamento \nde Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica (IQUIBICEN) de la Facultad de Cien -\ncias Exactas y Naturales. Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nThe role of erythropoietin (Epo) as a growth factor in erythropoiesis \nis well known. Many defects, both congenital and acquired, lead to \nineffective erythropoiesis, thus establishing the condition of anemia. \nThe demand for iron (Fe), necessary in biological processes, in -\ncluding erythropoiesis, gives importance to its controlled regulation. \nHepcidin (Hep) is a key regulator of systemic iron metabolism and \nits expression responds to Fe levels. The participation of Epo in the \nregulation of Hep has been investigated in hepatocytes but not in \nmacrophages, fundamental cells in Fe homeostasis that act as res -\nervoirs of senescent erythrocytes. Therefore, the aim of this work \nwas to investigate the regulation of Hep by Epo in macrophages.\nStandardization of the differentiation of monocytic THP-1 cells to \nmacrophages was carried out with different concentrations of phor -\nbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). According to cell morphology \n(visible light microscopy), results of viability, proliferation and mRNA \nlevels of the specific differentiation markers CD-14 and CD-68 (RT-\nPCR), 100 nM was chosen as the adequate PMA concentration \nto continue with the stated objective. The presence of EpoR was \ndemonstrated by Western blotting (anti-EpoR M20), RT-PCR and \nflow cytometry, comparing with UT-7 cells as a positive control. Epo \ntreatment of macrophages induced a significant decrease in Hep \nmRNA levels (RT-PCR, a.u.: C6h 0.39\u00b10.02; *Epo6h 0.11\u00b10.03; \n*Epo24h 0.09\u00b10.04, *P<0.05 vs. C6h, n=5). To investigate whether \nthis action of Epo takes place via its traditional pathway, evalua -\ntion of Hep levels was carried out in the presence of Jak2 (AG490) \nand PI3K (Ly294002) inhibitors and, under these conditions, Hep \nexpression was found increased. In conclusion, the results show \nthat Hep expression is modulated by Epo in macrophages, an effect \nthat occurs through its receptor and is mediated by the Jak2/PI3K \npathway.\n137. (306) ACTIVATION OF TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS 7 AND \n8 ON CD34+ CELLS BY COXSACKIEVIRUS B3 IMPAIRS \nMEGAKARYOCYTE AND PLATELET PRODUCTION\nCamila Sof\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez1, Nancy Lorena Char\u00f31, Paula One -\nto1, Ricardo G\u00f3mez2, Lina Paola D\u2019Atri1 y Mirta Schattner1\n1 Laboratorio de Trombosis Experimental, IMEX-CONI -\nCET-Academia Nacional de Medicina, Argentina. 2 Laborato -\nrio de Virus animales, Instituto de Biotecnolog\u00eda y Biolog\u00eda \nMolecular, UNLP-CONICET, La Plata, Argentina.\nBackground:  Increasing evidence indicates that hematopoietic pro -\ngenitor cells (CD34+ cells), megakaryocytes (MKs), and platelets \n(PLT) express toll-like receptors (TLR) allowing the contribution of \nthese cells to the immune response and inflammation. However, MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021120\nwhether TLRs\u2019 activation on CD34+ modulates megakaryo/throm -\nbopoiesis during viral infections is still unclear. \nObjectives:  We evaluated whether the single-strand RNA Coxsack -\nievirus B3 (CVB3) infection modulates human MK development and \nPLT production through TLR7/8 activation. \nMethods:  CD34+ cells from the human umbilical cord were exposed \nto CVB3 or UV-irradiated CVB3 virus (mock) and then stimulated \nwith thrombopoietin (TPO) in the presence or absence of TLR7/8 \nantagonists. The total number of cells (counting in a Neubauer \nchamber), CD34+ differentiation, maturation of MKs, PLT biogen -\nesis (flow cytometry), and expression of Fli-1, RUNX-1, and NF-E2 \n(qPCR) were determined after 12-17 days post-infection (dpi). \nResults:   Exposure of CD34+ cells to CVB3 resulted in productive \ninfection as determined by the presence of viral infectious particles \nin culture supernatants 1 to 11 dpi. Interestingly, CD34+ differentia -\ntion towards MKs (CD41+ cells) as well as MK maturation (CD42b+ \ncells), were markedly impaired (n=6, p<0.05) in infected cultures. \nmRNA expression of Fli-1, RUNX-1, and NF-E2, transcription fac -\ntors involved in these processes, was also downregulated in infect -\ned cells (n=5, p<0.05). The reduction in MK growth was associated \nwith an increase in cell apoptosis (n=4, p<0.05). CVB3 infection also \nled to a lower platelet count when compared to mock samples. De -\ncreased cell number, MK maturity, and PLT production were signifi -\ncantly reversed by TLR7/8 antagonists (n=4, p<0.05). \nConclusions:  These data suggest a new role for TLR7/8 in mega -\nkaryo/thrombopoiesis during viral infections that might contribute to \na better understanding of the molecular bases underlying thrombo -\ncytopenia during infectious processes.\n138.

Besides its direct oncokinase inhibition, the induction of an \nimmune antitumor mechanism has also been suggested.\nThe aim was to describe the gene expression dynamics of IL2, CI-\nITA, TBET , GATA3 , RORGT , FOXP3  and EOMES  in CML at diagno -\nsis and during the first year of treatment.\nTotal RNA from peripheral blood samples was collected from 79 CML \npatients (34 serially followed) at diagnosis (n:23) or under treatment \nat 3 (n:41), 6 (n42) or 12 (n:26) months classified according to the \nmolecular response at each time. Gene expression was evaluated \nby quantitative real-time PCR applying the comparative method 2-\u0394CT \nrelative to GAPDH  gene. Statistical analyses were performed using \nthe InfoStat software v2019 and p-values <0.05 were considered \nstatistically significant.\nBaseline expression of all immune mediators evaluated was sig -\nnificantly decreased when compared with healthy donors (n:26) \n(Mann-Whitney test p<0.0001). Once on therapy, each gene dis -\nplayed a particular behavior and similar between responders and \nnon-responders. TBET  and EOMES  reached normal levels after 1 \nyear (Kruskal Wallis test-KWt: p=0.2407 and p=0.0904). CIITA  and \nRORGT  continued downregulated throughout the follow-up (KWt: \np=0.0136 and p<0.0001). GATA3  and IL2 showed a normalization \non their expression levels at 6 months, followed by a decrease at 12 \nmonths (KWt: p=0.0045 and p=0.0083). Finally, FOXP3  achieved \nnormal levels early at 3 months (KWt: p=0.3859) and was sustained \nafterwards.\nThe obtained results agree and complement our previous results \ndescribing a suppression of the immune system in CML at diagno -sis and a re-activation after imatinib initiation with some mediators \nrequiring a longer exposure. A deeper understanding of the immuno -\nlogical landscape in CML is therefore important to comprehend the \nrole of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in restoring immune surveillance \nand characterize patients\u2019 outcomes.\n139.

Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nThe systemic regulation of Fe availability relies on the hepcidin/fer -\nroportin axis, which controls the mobilization of Fe stores for different \ncellular functions. It is currently recognized that transferrin receptors \n(TfRs) not only play a role in Fe acquisition but also in modulating \nits availability. While TfR1 has a high affinity for holo-transferrin (Tf-\nFe) \u2500with which it complexes and internalizes thus favoring cellular \ndeposition of Fe\u2500, TfR2 is deemed to regulate hepcidin expression, \nthrough mechanisms yet to be clarified.\nErythropoiesis is a major Fe-consuming physiological process, al -\nthough further research is needed to understand its effect on the \ndifferent factors involved in Fe homeostasis. In previous studies we \nfound an inhibitory effect of the erythroid survival factor erythropoie -\ntin (Epo, 160 ng/mL, 6 h) on hepcidin mRNA levels in HepG2 hepa -\ntocarcinoma cells. Here we report that Epo decreased TfR2 mRNA \nlevels in this cell type in the same treatment period (real-time PCR, \na.u.: Control=1.0, *Epo 6h=0.4\u00b10.1, Epo 15h=1.3\u00b10.3, *p<0.05, \nn=5). In contrast, TfR1 mRNA expression remained unaffected by \nEpo (RT-PCR, a.u.: Control=0.5\u00b10.1, Epo 6h=0.5\u00b10.1, n=6). The de -\ncrease in hepcidin and TfR2 mRNA levels after Epo treatment was \naccompanied by a significant reduction of intracellular Fe (potassi -\num ferrocyanide-based colorimetric assay, a.u.: Control=0.13\u00b10.08, \n*Epo 6h=0.06\u00b10.01, *p<0.05, and microscopy, n=4).\nIn line with the expression patterns previously observed for hepcidin, \nEpo also showed a tendency to suppress TfR2 mRNA levels after \naddition of ferric citrate (3 \u03bcM), although this effect was not observed \nin Fe-overloaded cells (100 \u03bcM). In contrast, Epo did not alter TfR1 \nexpression at any of the external Fe concentrations studied.\nAltogether, our findings highlight the involvement of Epo in the regu -\nlation of Fe homeostasis and hint at TfR2 modulation as a possible \nmechanism for Epo-induced hepcidin suppression in hepatic cells.\n140.

Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cni -\ncas (CONICET) \nIn recent years, cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid compound has \nemerged as a candidate for the control of different pathologies since \nit does not have a hallucinogenic effect. Several beneficial effects \nhave been reported in pain, epilepsy, arthritis, inflammation, etc. but \nthe mechanism by which CBD acts remains still in controversia. Also \nthe beneficial effect, several side effects were observed in patients \nunder CBD treatment. Among other side effects, anemia and ele -\nvation of transaminases were observed in 20-30% of the patients \nwith refractory epilepsy under CBD treatment. We hypothesized that \nCBD treatment could promote anemia reducing the RBCs viability. \nTo test this hypothesis, we use human RBCs obtained from samples \nwith normal hematometric parameters. The effect of CBD on osmot -\nic fragility, hemolysis, and morphological characteristics of normal \nand heat-damaged RBCs was evaluated. In vitro experiments were \nperformed using CBD 10-5M and 1-2% increase in the free hemoglo -\nbin concentration was observed while the osmotic fragility remained \nunchanged. The incubation of normal RBCs with CBD increases a ABSTRACTS121\n40% the number of elements, highlighting the formation of micro -\nspherocytes. This effect was time dependent and had a maximum \nat 20 minutes while at 40 minutes it returned to baseline. Heat-dam -\naged RBCs did not show changes in osmotic fragility, hemolysis, \nand CBD-induced morphology. Together, these results suggest that \nCBD induces the formation of hemolytic vesicles via protein signal -\ning from the cell membrane, with clinical relevance since the values \nof released hemoglobin were 10-15 times higher than the cut-off \nvalue (4mg%) for free hemoglobin in plasma.\nINFECTOLOG\u00cdA Y PARASITOLOG\u00cdA\n141.

As a control of the incidence \nof ECG non pathological findings a group of non-infected people \nwere included.\nResults: In enrolled treated patients: 24-hour Holter showed alter -\nations in 3/95 (3%) patients, but only one was considered probably \nrelated to CD involvement. This patient presented a complete right \nbundle branch block (cRBBB). No contractility damage was found in \n79/95 (83%) patients evaluated by STE.\nIn non-infected cardiological control group: 24-hour Holter showed \nalterations in 3/28 (10%) patients. No contractility damage was \nfound in 25/28 patients evaluated by STE.\nBenznidazole was prescribed in 87 patients and nifurtimox in 8 pa -\ntients. Baseline parasitemia data was available for 65/95 patients. \nDuring follow-up, 59/61 (96%) treated patients achieved constant \nnegative parasitemia evaluated by qPCR. A decrease in T.cruzi an -\ntibodies titers was observed and seroconversion occurred in 53/95 \n(56%) treated patients. These results showed a good efficacy of \ntreatment in parasite clearance.\nConclusions: A good treatment response with a low incidence of car -\ndiological lesions related to CD was observed. This suggests a pro -\ntective effect of parasiticidal treatment on the development of cardi -\nological lesions and highlights the importance of early treatment of \ninfected children.\n142.

Droplet dig -\nital PCR (ddPCR) is a highly sensitive PCR technology based on the \ngeneration of 20,000 nanodrops per tube. This technology is rarely \nused in clinical laboratories, due to its higher cost when compared \nwith PCR. Cost could be reduced by using pooled testing. A nega -tive test result indicates that all individuals in the pool are negative \nwhile a positive result indicates that at least one individual is posi -\ntive. Pooled testing may be particularly useful to communities with \nlow prevalence of COVID-19. We proposed to validate the use of \nddPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 by pooling.\nThroat swab samples of 1000 patients were collected and soaked \nin 2mL saline. RNA extraction was done using automatic magnetic \nextraction, columns extraction kits, and heat. Firstly, positive and \nnegative samples were identified with RT-PCR, pools of different siz -\nes were designed and ddPCR was performed. Data was analyzed \nwith Quanta Soft analysis software v.1.7.4.0917 (Bio-Rad). This \nstudy was granted exception from bioethics committee approval as \ndeidentified remnants samples were used.\nWe determined the specificity (we measured 100 negatives pools), \nthe limit of detection (three independent octuplicates of the greatest \ndilution that it is positive) and the robustness of the method (the abil -\nity to withstand small but deliberate variations in method parameters \nby performing 20 repetitions changing the order of pooling and puri -\nfication; and by measuring RNAs obtained using different extraction \nmethod). In the present work, we validated the use of pooled testing \nby combining up to 34 samples per pool.\nWe hope that such implementation of a pool test for SARS-CoV-19 \nwould allow expanding current screening capacities, thereby en -\nabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in \nclose organic groups.\n143.

We randomly assigned children  \nwith STEC-HUS to the rHuEPO group (subcutaneous rHuEPO 150 \nU/kg/week  + RBC transfusion if hemoglobin \u22647 g/dLand/or hemody -\nnamic instability) or  to the usual- caregroup (RBC transfusion if he -\nmoglobin \u22647 g/dL  and/or hemodynamic instability). Primary outcome \nwas the number of RBC  transfusions received during the hospital -\nization. Secondary outcomes were to explore  whether baseline EPO \nlevels were deficient (according to the relation  between observed \nand predicted level), to correlate selected acute phase  parameters \nwith the number of RBC transfusions, and to assess  possible ad -\nverse events.\nResults: Twelve patients per arm were included, all  completed the \ntrial. They were comparable at recruitment and coursed  a similar \nacute disease. Median number of RBC transfusions was  similar be -\ntween groups (1.5, p=0.76). Most patients had appropriate baseline  \nEPO levels, which did not correlate with the number of  RBC trans -\nfusions (r 0.19, p=0.44). Conversely, baseline (r 0.73, p=0.032)  and \nmaximum lactic dehydrogenase levels (r 0.78, p=0.003), creatinine \npeak  (r 0.71, p=0.03) and dialysis duration (r 0.7, p=0.04) correlated  \nsignificantly with RBC requirements. No potential side effect was \nattributed  to rHuEPO therapy.\nConclusion: Administration of rHuEPO did not reduce the number \nof RBC transfusions in children with STEC-HUS .\n144.

III), 2021122\nBackground:  The cestode Echinococcus granulosus  (Eg) is the \netiological agent of cystic echinococcosis. This parasite develops \ncysts filled with hydatid fluid (HF) in the viscera of the intermediate \nhost. Autophagy is a cellular catabolic process that plays a key role \nin the presentation of endogenous and exogenous proteins, promot -\ning the activation of T cells. The aim of this work is to analyze if HF, \nconstituted by a wide range of parasite proteins, could trigger auto -\nphagy in dendritic cells. Methods: HF was punctured from the hy -\ndatid cysts collected of infected cattle slaughtered. Murine BMDCs \nwere cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with FLT3-L. \nFirst, lysosome activity was evaluated using Acridine Orange, a flu -\norophore that can be trapped in acidic vesicular organelles. Then, \nautophagy induction was evaluated by FACS, qPCR, Confocal and \nTransmission Electron Microscopy. Rapamycin (20 nM) and chlo -\nroquine (100\u03bcM) were used to modulate autophagic flux. LC3-at -\ntachment to the autophagic membrane, were analyzed by stained \nDCs with anti LC3-\u03b2 antibody (clone H50). Results:   HF significantly \nincreased acridine orange cytoplasmic accumulation compared to \ncontrol cells (***p <0.001) and enhanced the effect of rapamycin \n(****p<0.0001). The ultrastructural analysis of TEM showed that in \nthe presence of HF, DCs stimulate the formation of phagophores, \ndouble lipid membrane autophagosome, MVBs and autolysosomes. \nAlso, HF-stimulated BMDCs significantly enhanced the mean fluo -\nrescence intensity of LC3-positive structures in comparison with un -\nstimulated cells (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 HF-stimulated cells \nvs controls). Finally, we have observed that HF induces a signifi -\ncant increase in the transcriptional expression of LC3 and Beclin-1 \n(n=3, **p <0.01 vs control) and enhances the expression induced by \nrapamycin. Conclusions:   These results suggest that HF of Echino -\ncoccus granulosus  regulates gene expression to increase autopha -\ngy-related structures in DCs.\n145.

HUS is characterized by microangiopathic hemo -\nlytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure. A variety of neu -\nrological alterations are often associated with poor prognosis and \nmortality risk, becoming the highest incidence of death due to HUS. \nIn addition to Stx, EHEC is a gram-negative bacterium and thus re -\nleases LPS known to be involved in proinflammatory-related events \nwhich contributes significantly to the development of the disease. \nEarly detection of neural serum biomarkers during the first days of \nbloody diarrhea manifestation, and prior HUS signs and symptoms, \ncould be determinant to prevent the progress of the disease. We \nare currently studying the tau protein associated-neuronal microtu -\nbules. Its presence in blood as a neuronal damage consequence \nconfirms a wide spectrum of brain insults. The aim of this work was \nto determine whether the neuronal tau protein can be considered \nan early serological biomarker of encephalopathy in the context of \nHUS. For this purpose, NIH-Swiss male mice were intravenously \ninjected with vehicle, LPS (800ng), Stx2 (3.5ng, 1LD100) or a com -\nbination of Stx2 and LPS (Stx2+LPS, same previous amounts). After \n1-and 2- days blood samples were collected to test by Elisa (Invit -\nrogen, Viena, Austria) the detection of tau protein. One way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests were employed for statistical analysis. A \nsignificant two-fold increase was determined after 2 days in the Stx -\n2+LPS group (p<0.05) with respect to the vehicle. Non-significant \ntau protein immunodetection was found in all groups after 1 day of \ntreatment. Assuming that the murine death occurs after the fourth \nday of treatment, and that significant tau serum immunodetection \nwas determined within 2 days, this protein could be used as a poten -\ntial biomarker to prevent lethal encephalopathy associated to HUS.\n146.

Moreover, BMDCs \nfrom infected animals presented phenotypic alterations as shown \nby increases in CD80 and CD86 maturation markers and fewer se -\ncretion levels of IL-6 and IL-10, with no differences in IL-12. To ex -\ntend these previous results, herein, we studied the ability of BMDC \nfrom chronically infected mice to activate and differentiate effector \nT cells. Methods : Bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) \nwere obtained from naive and chronically infected mice, by culturing \nbone-marrow precursors for nine days with GM-CSF-conditioned \nmedium. Afterward, BMDC were fed with OVA and matured during \n18h with LPS. Subsequently, BMDC were cultured with DO11.10 \nOVA-specific CD4+T cells. Also, a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) \nwas performed by co-culturing BMDC with naive C57BL/6 mice \nsplenocytes. Results : OVA specific CD4+ T cells co-cultured with \nBMDCs from infected mice showed lower levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-5 \nand increased levels of IL-10 (p<0.05). When analyzing polyclon -\nal T cell responses in MLR assays, T lymphocytes incubated with \nBMDCs from infected mice showed decreased secretion of IFN-\u03b3 \nand IL-10 (p<0.01). No significant differences were observed for \nTh2 cytokines. Conclusion : The data obtained with BMDCs show \nthat mice chronically infected with T. gondii  present alterations of \nbone-marrow precursors. Interestingly, the diminished Th1/Th2 pro -\nfiles observed in antigen specific co-culture assays are in line with \nresults previously observed in splenocytes from T. gondii  infected \nmice. These results suggest that infection with T. gondii  results in \nlong-lasting alterations in hematopoietic cells that could be involved \nin the lower susceptibility to developing allergic and autoimmune \ndisorders.\n147.

The \naim of the present work was to study the immunogenicity of vaccine \nformulations containing a new cage-like particle adjuvant (ISPA) in \ncombination with T. gondii  recombinant proteins. \nMETHODS: C57BL/6 mice were intradermally immunized 3-times \nwith a 2-week interval with rGRA7, rTgPF, rTgPI-1 or rROP2 in com -ABSTRACTS123\nbination with ISPA, and control groups received ISPA or PBS. Four -\nteen-days later, mice were orally challenged with a non-lethal dose \nof T. gondii  cysts and after one month, brain cyst numbers were \ndetermined under optical microscope. Antigen-specific responses \nwere characterized two weeks after the last immunization in sera, \nspleen (SC) and draining lymph node (DLN) cultures.\nRESULTS: Significant reduction in brain parasite load was obtained \nwith rGRA7+ISPA ( p<0.05 ), rTgPF+ISPA ( p<0.05 ) and rROP2+IS -\nPA (p<0.01 ) formulations. All experimental groups elicited strong \nhumoral responses (IgG:p<0.0001)  with a mixed profile (Th1/Th2). \nrTgPF+ISPA induced a strong Th1 systemic cellular response \ncharacterized by increased levels of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in SC \n(p<0.01 and p<0.005, respectively)  and DLN (p<0.05) , and IFN-\u03b3 \n(SC:p<0.0001; DLN:p<0.0001) . On the other hand, rGRA7+ISPA \nand rRop2+ISPA formulations induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response \nsince significant IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-5 production was detected after \nantigen-specific stimulation (SC and DLN: p<0.05) . Only rGRA7+IS -\nPA generated high numbers of CD4+ cells in SC (p<0.001) . Addition -\nally, IL-10 secretion was observed in all vaccinated groups both in \nSC and DLN (p <0.01) . \nCONCLUSION: The present results indicate that the use of ISPA \nas an adjuvant of rGRA7, rTgPF and rROP2 antigens was able to \nenhance and modulate the specific responses generating partial \nprotection against chronic Toxoplasma  infection.\n148. (174) DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGHLY SENSITIVE NS1 CAP -\nTURE ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY FOR \nTHE DETECTION OF ACUTE ZIKA VIRUS INFECTION\nJulieta S. Rold\u00e1n, Alejandro Cassola, Daniela S. Castillo\nInstituto de Investigaciones Biotecnol\u00f3gicas \u201cDr. Rodolfo A. \nUgalde\u201d (IIBIO), Universidad Nacional de San Mart\u00edn (UN -\nSAM)\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that is primarily transmitted from bites \nof infected Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus  mosquitoes. There \nare currently no vaccines to prevent ZIKV infection nor commercially \navailable clinical diagnostic tests demonstrated to identify ZIKV with -\nout cross-reactive interference of other related flaviviruses. In this \ncontext, the development of sensitive and accurate diagnostic meth -\nods is urgently needed for the early detection of ZIKV. Nonstructural \nprotein 1 (NS1) is a highly conserved glycoprotein that is secreted \nas a hexamer and circulates at high levels in the bloodstream of \nacute patients. These properties turn ZIKV NS1 (ZNS1) into a good \ndiagnostic marker, allowing early detection and diagnosis of ZIKV \ninfection. In order to develop a highly specific and sensitive capture \nELISA, we aimed at obtaining monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against \nhexameric ZNS1 protein. We selected 6F6 specific hybridoma \nclone, which binds to a ZNS1 linear epitope. Cross-reaction studies \nthrough Western blotting, indirect ELISA and immunofluoresence \nstaining indicated that 6F6 specifically recognizes ZNS1, and does \nnot cross-react with the NS1 protein from other related flaviviruses. \nThe 6F6 mAb enabled the development of a sensitive, reliable and \nreproducible capture ELISA with a limit of detection (LOD) of 10.8 \nng/ml and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 29.4 ng/ml. The accuracy \nof the 6F6 sandwich ELISA was assessed by spike-and-recovery \ntests, obtaining average recoveries between the ideal range from 80 \nto 120%. In conclusion, we established a valid capture ELISA that \nallows the detection and quantification of small amounts of ZNS1 in \nhuman sera, and constitutes a promising bioanalytical method for \ncontrol strategies and the prevention of ZIKV propagation.\n149.

Laboratorio de microbiolog\u00eda celular y desarrollo de vacu -\nnas, CINDEFI (Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, UNLP - CO -\nNICET)\nOuter membrane vesicles (OMVs) secreted by pathogenic bacteria \nare usually loaded with virulence factors that get to the host cell \nwithout close contact with the bacteria. Bordetella pertussis  (Bp), the etiologic agent of pertussis, releases OMVs during infection. By \nproteomics analysis we confirmed the presence of most of Bp vir -\nulence factors in OMVs, adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA, a strong \nimmunomodulatory toxin) among them. In this study we investigated \nwhether the presence of OMVs affects the outcome of Bp encoun -\nter with neutrophils (PMN), the main defense of the host against \ninvading pathogens. We first studied the effect of the OMVs in the \ninnate encounter of Bp with PMN. The presence of OMVs led to a \nsignificant decrease in bacterial uptake, which proved to be depen -\ndent on the delivery of CyaA from these vesicles, as determined \nby studies performed with OMVs isolated from a Bp CyaA deficient \nmutant (OMVs-CyaA-). Confocal microscopy studies showed a sig -\nnificant decrease in bacterial colocalization with the late endosomal/\nlysosomal marker LAMP-1 in PMN incubated with OMVs as com -\npared with PMN treated with media or OMVsCyaA-, suggesting a \nbactericidal modulating effect of CyaA. Our results further showed \nthat OMVs might protect Bp from PMN even in immune hosts. By \nmeans of double immune staining and fluorescence microscopy in \ncombination with the use of cytochalasin D, we here observed that \nin the presence of specific antibodies the OMVs get opsonized and \ncompete with opsonized bacteria for FcgR on PMN, leading to a \nsignificant decrease in the number of bacteria taken up by PMN. \nConfocal microscopy studies also showed that bacterial colocal -\nization with LAMP-1 was significantly lower in PMN incubated with \nopsonized OMVs as compared with PMN treated with media alone, \nfavoring the odds of bacterial survival also in immunized individuals. \nTaken together, these results seem to indicate that OMVs delivery \nshould be considered within the immune evasion mechanisms of Bp\n150.

Facultad de Medicina-Universi -\ndad de Buenos Aires.\nChronic chagasic cardiomyopathy is characterized by parasite per -\nsistence, chronic inflammation and cardiac cell (Mc) death that may \nend lead to fibrosis and cardiac insufficiency. Activated fibroblasts \n(Fb) are involved in this process. Previous results from our group \nshow that fenonofibrate (Fen), a PPAR\u03b1 ligand, modulates the ex -\npression of inflammatory mediators, prevents fibrosis and restores \ncardiac function in Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc) -infected mice. To deep -\nen into the knowledge of the role of Mc and Fb in these events, in the \npresent work we used an in vitro model of neonatal murine cardiac \ncells. We studied the modulator role of Fen on the inflammatory re -\nsponse of Mc and Fb infected with Tc. Mc and Fb were characterized \nby the expression of troponin C and s \u03b1-SMA, respectively, using \nWestern blot (Wb). Wb and RT-qPCR analysis showed that Tc stim -\nulated the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic enzymes \nlike NOS2 and MMP-9 in Mc and Fb, whereas treatment with Fen \n(100\u00b5M) inhibited such expression in both cell lineages. In addition, \nafter 48 hs of infection we observed increased expression of CTGF, \nMMP-2 and TGF-\u03b2 by RT-qPCR in Mc and Fb, whereas Fen inhibit -\ned such increment (p<0,05).\nBesides, the rise of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 after 2 to 6h of infection was \nprecluded by Fen. Furthermore, while NF\u03baB was activated at 30 min \npost-infection in Mc and Fb since cytoplasmic I\u03baB\u03b1 was significantly \nreduced as determined by Wb, treatment with Fen precluded such \nactivation. Finally, the ability of Mc- and Fb -conditioned media to \npromote the expression of NOS2 in Fb and Mc was analyzed. Both \nmedia induced the expression of NOS2 in Fb and Mc while Fen in -\nhibited its expression as assessed by Wb. These results emphasize \nthe role of Mc and Fb in the inflammatory and pro-fibrotic response \nto Tc and the interaction between these cell lineages that Fen is able \nto modulate.MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells (PBMCs) infiltrate the tissue and differentiate \ninto inflammatory macrophages. Advances in pathophysiology show \nthat myeloid cell subpopulations contribute to cardiac homeostasis, \nemerging as possible therapeutic targets. In this work we investigat -\ned the spontaneous release of inflammatory cytokines and chemo -\nkines, changes in the frequencies of monocyte (Mo) subsets and \nthe effects of fenofibrate (Fen) on PBMC of patients with different \nclinical forms of Chagas disease. PBMC isolated from CHD by Fi -\ncoll\u00ae  display higher levels of IL-12, TGF-\u03b2, IL-6, MCP1 and CCR2 \nthan cells from uninfected individuals (HI) or asymptomatic (Asy), as \ntested by RT-qPCR,  (P<0,05). Fen reduces the levels of pro-inflam -\nmatory mediators and CCR2 in both Asy and CHD (P< 0,05). Also, \nCHD patients display a significantly higher percentage of classical \nMo in comparison with Asy and HI (P<0,05). Besides, Asy have a \nsignificantly higher percentage of non-classical Mo than CHD or HI \n(P<0,05). However, no difference in the intermediate Mo subpopu -\nlation was found between groups. Moreover, Mo from Asy or CHD \npatients exhibit different responses upon stimulation in vitro  with Tc \nlysates and Fen treatment.  Tc stimulation significantly increased \nthe percentage of classical Mo and decreased percentage of inter -\nmediate Mo in the Asy group. Also, there were no changes in their \nfrequencies in CHD or HI. Notably, stimulation with Tc did not alter \nthe frequency of non-classical Mo in any of the groups. Moreover, \nFen treatment of Tc-stimulated PBMC increased even more the fre -\nquency of non-classical Mo in Asy patients. Summing up, our results \nstress a potential role for Fen as modulator of Mo towards an an -\nti-inflammatory profile in different stages of chronic Chagas disease. \n152.

For controls, an isosmotic (ISO) \nmedium was used.\nCells were grown on 12 well plates and pretreated for 30 minutes \nwith HgCl2 (10 \u03bcM) or TEA (100 \u03bcM) or pretreated during 24 h with \nEG (10 \u03bcM). Then, HGEC and HK-2 were incubated with Stx2 (50 \n\u03bcM) for an additional 40 minutes. Cell volume was analyzed by light \nmicroscopy and measuring cell area by using Image J software. \nAfter Stx2 and HYPO medium treatments, a significant increase in \nthe cell volume of HGEC (Stx2: 42%; HYPO: 36%, n= 3, p<0.05) and \nHK-2 (Stx2: 70%; HYPO: 55%, n= 3, p<0.05) was detected respect \nto ISO medium. However, when HGEC and HK-2 were pretreated \nwith HgCl2 or TEA a significant swelling prevention was obtained for \nHGEC (Stx2+HgCl2:100%; Stx2+TEA:86%; HYPO+HgCl2: 42.5%; \nHYPO+TEA: 83%, n=3, p<0.05) and HK-2 (Stx2+HgCl2: 90%; Stx -\n2+TEA: 85%; HYPO+HgCl2: 55%; HYPO+TEA: 75%, n=3, p<0.05). \nIn addition, EG also was able to prevent HK-2 swelling in 87 % (n=1) \nwith respect to Stx2 treatment.  \nResults show that AQPs may be involved in the water movement in -\nside HGEC and HK-2 induced by Stx2, since HgCl2 and TEA avoid -\ned this effect. Furthermore, binding of Stx2 to Gb3 could be the initial \nstep for the development of cellular mechanisms that possibly trig -\nger the entry of solutes into the cells and the consequent osmotic \ngradient responsible for the hypotonic effect.\n153.

Neither a licensed \nvaccine nor effective therapy for HUS is available for humans. Pre -\nviously, we demonstrated the in vitro  cytotoxic effects of Shiga toxin \ntype 2 (Stx2) on human glomerular endothelial cells (HGEC). Re -\ncently, recombinant antibodies against Stx2, produced in bacteria, \nwere developed, and characterized. In this work, we studied the abil -\nity of anti-Stx2 FabF8:Stx2 antibody to neutralize the Stx2 activity on \nprimary cultures of HGEC. Cells were plated in 96-well plates and \ngrown to confluence. Then, cells were treated in growth-arrested \nconditions for 72 h with different pre-incubations (1 h at 37\u00baC) or \nco-incubations of FabF8 with Stx2. Antibodies were used from 10 \n\u00b5g/mL to 0.001 \u00b5g/mL and Stx2 at the dilution required to kill 50% \nof cells (0.5 ng/mL). Finally, cell viability was assessed by neutral \nred uptake. In addition, cells were seeded on gelatine coated glass \ncoverslips and then treated, as it was previously mentioned, with \n1 \u00b5g/mL FabF8 and 0.5 ng/mL Stx2, during 72 h. Percentage of \nnecrotic and apoptotic cells were established by fluorescence mi -\ncroscopy after staining with acridine orange/ethidium bromide. Un -\nder both conditions evaluated, FabF8:Stx2 significantly neutralized, \nin a dose-dependent manner, the cytotoxic effects caused by 0.5 \nng/mL Stx2 in HGEC (p <0.05, n = 3). HGEC viability was protect -\ned by 10 \u00b5g/mL FabF8 in about 67.5% at the co-incubation con -\ndition, and about 83% at the pre-incubation condition. Additionally, \nFabF8:Stx2 significantly prevented HGEC necrosis (pre: 60%; co: \n92.5%) and apoptosis (pre: 93% and co:75%) (p <0.05, n = 3). The \nresults demonstrate the high efficiency of FabF8:Stx2 to avoid the \ncytotoxic effects of Stx2 on HGEC, therefore, they could be used \nas a therapeutic strategy to prevent the renal damage described in \npatients with HUS.\n154.

Laboratorio de microbiolog\u00eda celular y desarrollo de vacu -\nnas, CINDEFI (Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, UNLP - CO -\nNICET)\nBordetella pertussis  (Bp) is the etiological agent of whooping cough, \na reemerging respiratory tract disease. Current vaccines do not pre -\nvent transmission and epidemiological data indicates that vaccinat -\ned asymptomatic carriers are important reservoirs and constitute a \nsource of transmission to vulnerable unvaccinated subjects. Recent \nstudies suggest the existence of an intracellular niche of persistence \ninside host macrophages. We here investigated the potential role \nof the respiratory epithelial barrier in the infectious process and \nthe eventual development of persistent infections. In binding as -\nsays Bp showed a clear tropism for tight junctions (TJ) of polarized \n16HBE14o- cells as determined by fluorescence microscopy. This \ntropism seemed to be directed by the bacterial preference for ba -\nsolateral membrane (BLM) mediated by FHA as addressed using \na FHA defective strain. Our results further showed that wild type \nBp but not an adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) deficient Bp strain \ndisrupted TJ integrity as determined by confocal microscopy. This \nsuggests that access of Bp to BLM in intact monolayers might be \ngranted by the action of local high concentrations of CyaA released \nby the bacteria attached near TJ. The study of bacterial intracellu -\nlar trafficking revealed that most internalized bacteria did not colo -\ncalize with lysosomal marker cathepsin D two days after infection \nsuggesting that Bp avoids phagolysosomal fusion. Furthermore, we \nobserved intracellular bacteria colocalizing with recycling pathway \nmarker transferrin at this time point, indicating that Bp might survive \nin non-degradative vesicles with access to nutrients. Accordingly, \nantibiotic protection assays showed high intracellular survival lev -\nels over the time post infection. Taken together, these results show \nthat Bp can compromise epithelial barrier, invade cells and persist \nin intracellular location in the respiratory epithelium, pointing out its \npotential relevance as another persistence niche.\n155.

Given the urgent need for drugs to halt \nCOVID-19 infection, one of the most valuable strategies is drug \nrepurposing. The aim of this study was to analyze the antiviral ef -\nfect of hemin and ivermectin (IVM), two drugs approved by Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA). The effect of hemin and IVM was \nevaluated in human pulmonary epithelial cells (A549 cell line). We \nevaluated the expression of genes related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, \nantiviral genes and anti-inflammatory genes by RT-qPCR. First, we \nestablished the optimal doses of hemin (80 uM) and IVM (10 uM) \nin this experimental model. Then, we cultured A549 cells with he -\nmin and IVM, alone or in combination during different timepoints. \nWe found that IVM treatment resulted in an increased expression \nof MX1 (p<0.001), an antiviral response gene against a great di -\nversity of viruses. Moreover, in this in vitro  model, hemin induced \nthe expression of HMOX1 (p<0.001), a gene that encodes for the \nanti-inflammatory protein HO-1, and this effect was enhanced when \nhemin was combined with IVM (p<0.001). Concerning the proteins \nassociated with virus entry into the host cell, we found that both IVM \nand hemin decreased the expression of BSG (p<0.01), a membrane \nreceptor that facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry, and the combination of these drugs increased the expression of ADAM17 (p<0.001), whose \nactivity is related to viral entry inhibition. Finally, we mimicked viral \ninfection using Poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded \nRNA. Poly(I:C) treatment increased NF-\u03baB and IRF3 expressions, \nvalidating the Poly(I:C) responsiveness of A549 cells. In this viral \nsimulation context, IVM treatment also boosted MX1 expression \n(p<0.05) and hemin induced HMOX1 (p<0.001). Altogether, our re -\nsults ascertain the potential antiviral action of hemin and IVM com -\nbination.\n156. (329) B.

The devel -\nopment of improved strategies to control it requires identifying the \nmechanism of persistence within the host to eventually eradicate the \ncarriage. We previously found that an intracellular stage in epithelial \ncells might be important for its persistence. In that work we found a \ntropism of Bpp for tight junctions (TJ). Like for other pathogens, this \nmight indicate the existence of a mechanism to subvert epithelial \nbarrier function. We here investigated the role of the barrier function \nduring Bpp infection. To this end we used the 16HBE14o- bronchial \ncell line that polarize in vitro and form TJ. Two experimental mod -\nels were used. A fully 7-day polarized confluent monolayer in which \napical and basolateral (BL) components are largely separated by \nTJ and a 1-day confluent monolayer, which lacks of TJ and hence \nbarrier function. Cells were infected with Bpp and the outcome of \nthis interaction was evaluated. Microscopy analysis showed that 6 h \nafter infection the attachment and internalization were higher in the \n1-day model than in the 7-day model, indicating that the infection \nefficiency increased when barrier function are absent and Bpp ac -\ncess BL components. We further evaluated how Bpp accesses the \nBL components in a monolayer with intact TJ. Microscopy analysis \nshowed that early after infection of the 7-day model Bpp adheres to \nand progressively disrupts TJ in an adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) \ndependent way, suggesting that Bpp might access the BL compo -\nnents by subverting epithelial barrier. Accordingly, a CyaA defective \nmutant showed a reduced efficiency to access the intracellular lo -\ncation in a 7-day model with intact TJ. These results suggest that \nCyaA-mediated epithelial barrier disruption might grant Bpp access \nto the intracellular location of epithelial cells and/or the possibility to \ndisseminate to underlying tissues.\n157.

In \nadittion, it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 protein \nas a receptor to enter host cells, and although genetic variants are \nknown, their frequency has not been described in the local popu -\nlation.\nMethods: Nasopharyngeal swabs (reference control) and saliva \nsamples were processed by RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-\nCoV-2. An additional blood sample was used to genotype the \nACE2 gene variants 2158A> G (N720D, rs41303171) and 631G> A \n(G211R, rs148771870).\nResults: 95 patients were included. The analysis of the character -\nistics of the studied population showed an average age of 48\u00b122 \nyears. The time between the onset of symptoms and the hospital \nevaluation was 4\u00b12 days. A high correlation was obtained between \nnasopharyngeal swab and saliva obtained using the column ex -\ntraction methodology, with an analytical sensitivity of 92%. The dis -\naggregated analysis based on population characteristics showed \ngreater sensitivity in patients with more severe symptoms (requiring \nhospitalization and high-flow oxygen) and long lasting symptoms at \nthe time of consultation (> 2 days). Saliva samples showed higher \nCycle threshold  (Ct) amplification results compared to nasopharyn -\ngeal swab samples. By RT-PCR, the amplification cut-off points are \nbetween 37-40 cycles. Several Saliva samples, although \u201cdetect -\nable\u201d (Ct <37), amplified at higher cycles (around 5 cycles) com -\npared to nasopharyngeal swab samples. Analysis of the variants of \nthe ACE2 gene show the wild-type form for 2158A>G and 631G>A \nin all the cases analyzed.\nDiscussion: The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva seems to be an \nappropriate method for the diagnosis of COVID-19, presenting ex -\ncellent sensitivity, which increases depending on the severity and \nduration of the condition. ACE2 genetic variants do not appear to be \ncommon in the local population.\n159.

Depto. de Econom\u00eda, UNS.The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to implement \nstrategies to mitigate the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. \nAsymptomatic transmission among healthcare workers (HCWs) at \nthe front line of care is particularly concerning due to the potential \nemergence of outbreaks at healthcare centers. With the final goal of \nearly identification and isolation of asymptomatic infected HCWs, we \nvalidated a pooled-sample screening and assessed implementation \noutcomes and results of an epidemiological surveillance strategy \ncarried out during a 12-month period at public health institutions \nin Bah\u00eda Blanca. To develop and validate a coronavirus detection \nmethod, RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs and iden -\ntification of the viral E gene was done by an \u201cin-house\u201d RT-qPCR \nusing Taqman probes and the human gene RNAseP  as a control. \nValidation against a commercial kit demonstrated high sensibility \nand specificity of our test (95%, IC 95%: [85%-100%]). To increase \nour testing capacity, we validated sample pooling (n= 5) prior to RNA \nextraction. The results showed a sensibility of 73% (IC 95%: [46%-\n99%]) and specificity of 100% against individuals. A tailor-made soft -\nware called \u201cVIGI-COVID\u201d was designed to properly manage data. A \nprospective cohort study was conducted since 15/09/20 to 15/09/21. \n860 HCWs were included in the epidemiological surveillance and \n1765 swabs were performed. The annual cumulative incidence was \n2,30% IC95% [1,26% - 3,39%] (20/860), and 43% of the 860 HCWs \nwere swabbed more than once. Our study demonstrated the utili -\nty of comprehensive screening of asymptomatic HCWs during the \nCOVID19 pandemic. Early identification and isolation of infected \nHCWs prevent the onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2, reducing \nthe risk of healthcare-associated outbreaks.\n160.

Our laboratory has developed the EGPE cell line from bovine \nEg G1 protoscoleces (Echeverria et al, 2010) for studies of anti -\nparasitic drugs and identification of relevant molecules in diagnosis \nand treatment of CE. This work aimed  to identify and characterize \nproteins from Eg in the EGPE cells recognized by CE patients\u2019 sera. \nMaterials and methods:  total proteins extract from EGPE cells \n20 days grown was passed through a gel filtration column. Protein \nfractions were concentrated through a 3K cut\u2010off membrane con -\ncentrator. Reactive fractions to Western Blot were passed through \naffinity columns with CE or other parasitosis patient\u2019s sera. Then iso -\nlated proteins were identified by proteomic in CEQUIBIEM (FCEyN, \nUBA). Proteins were modeled using Robetta platform (TrRosetta \nmethod) and validated by molecular dynamics simulations with soft -\nware NAMD 2.14. Epitope prediction was performed with IEDB (lin -\near epitope prediction and Discotope 2.0) and ABCpred. Results:  \nWe identified Eg\u2019s Histone H2A (W6U0N3, 195 aa) recognized by \nsera from CE and others parasitosis patients. W6U0N3 has 81% \nidentity in the first 58 aa with Fasciola hepatica \u2019s histone H2A. Gen -\nerated model was validated showing in 10-50 ns section of the tra -\njectory an averaged potential energy resultant -168208 \u00b1 198 kcal/\nmol. This model presented two regions with different RMSD values \nfor the trajectory taking the averaged structure as reference: for 1-14 \naa region, 3.32 +/- 0.77 \u00c5 and for 14-195 aa region, 2.16 +/- 0.61 \n\u00c5. Linear epitopes were predicted in 123-138, 138-153 and 170-\n185 aa, meanwhile conformational epitopes were predicted in the \n1-14 aa region. Conclusion: Intracellular Histone H2A from EGPE ABSTRACTS127\ncells is recognized by CE and others parasitosis patient\u2019s sera, that \ncould mean a marker for specific stages in the development of some \nparasitosis.\n161.

This behavior can be analyzed by mathematical algorithms \nthat determine the Fractal Dimension (FD) and the predictive deter -\nmination coefficient (R\u00b2). FD would express virus temporal repetition \nand R\u00b2 would express response capacity to environment demands, \nits value ranges between 0 and 1, greater than 0.5 would indicate \npersistence of the system. The aim of this work was to analyze \ntemporal distribution of COVID-19 using Higuchi Algorithm (HA) \nfor predictive purposes in the Argentine Republic (AR), Santa Fe \nProvince (SFP) and Rosario City (RC) according to the epidemi -\nological week (EW). Observational, longitudinal and prospective \nstudy. COVID-19 positive cases (PC) were considered by testing \n(nasopharyngeal swab-PCR) according to daily reports from the \nMinistry of Health, from the first PC in EW 10 and 11 (2020) to \nEW 32 (2021). HA was applied by EW. Median (M) and standard \ndeviation (\u00b1) were obtained from FD and R\u00b2, and Pearson\u2019s cor -\nrelation coefficient (r) between FD and R\u00b2 according to the territory. \nResults: FD (AR): M=2.47\u00b10.36, R\u00b2 (AR): M=0.96\u00b10.03; FD (SFP): \nM=1.7\u00b10.44, R\u00b2 (SFP): M=0.74\u00b10.13; FD (RC): M=1.63\u00b10.45, R\u00b2 \n(RC): M=0.72\u00b10.14. Correlation for AR: r=0.37 (p\u02c20.17), SFP: r=0.89 \n(p\u02c20.0001) and RC: r=0.74 (p\u02c20.0015). Conclusion: COVID-19 be -\nhavior in AR shows a growing and sustained temporal manifestation, \nand interaction system-environment, while SFP and RC have found \nlimitations of environment interaction. COVID-19 could be sustained \nfor a longer time in the AR regarding SFP and CR if the current con -\nditions are maintained. AR PC decrease would not be accompanied \nby a fall off in the adaptation capacity of COVID-19 to the environ -\nment, that would not occur in SFP and RC. This conduct requires \nstudying the impact of sanitary measures.\n162.

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae \nfamily, consisting of a group of enveloped viruses with single-strand -\ned RNA genomes which cause diseases ranging from common colds \nto acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although the main transmis -\nsion routes for SARS-CoV-2 are the inhalation of aerosols/droplets \nand person-to-person contact, current evidence available indicates \nthat the viral RNA is present in wastewater, suggesting the need to \nbetter understand this route as a potential source of epidemiologi -cal data and human health risks. To this aim, 32 sewage samples \nwere collected between May and June 2020 from wastewater in the \ncities of San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n and Yerba Buena, Argentina. Be -\nfore viral concentration, composite samples were heat inactivated to \nincrease handling safety. Next, wastewater samples (200 ml) were \nmixed with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and NaCl. Mixtures were left \nto stand overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Subsequently, they were centrifuged, and \npellets were resuspended in TRIZOL. The extraction of viral RNA \nwas executed using the PURO VIRUS KIT (Productos BIO-L\u00f3gi -\ncos). A real-time RT-qPCR assay targeting the N gene, using SARS-\nCoV-2 specific primer and probes set, was performed. RT-qPCR mix \nwas prepared using qScript XLT 1-Step RT-PCR (Quantabio) in a \none-step system. While 6 out of 16 samples collected in May were \npositive, 8 out of 16 from June turned out positive. Interestingly, the \nincrease in positive samples correlates with the increase in the num -\nber of human cases detected, further supporting wastewater-based \nepidemiology as a sensitive tool to study spatial and temporal trends \nof virus circulation in the population.\n163. (539) ASSESSMENT OF SHIGA TOXIN PRODUCING \nESCHERICHIA COLI  O157:H7 PATHOGENICITY IN THE \nPRESENCE OF SHORT CHAIN FATTY ACIDS AND LAC -\nTATE\nRomina Fern\u00e1ndez Brando, Alan Bernal, Fernando Sosa, \nMar\u00eda Victoria Ramos, Marina Palermo\nLaboratorio de Patog\u00e9nesis de Procesos Infecciosos, \nIMEX-CONICET-ANM, Bs As, Argentina.\nShiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli  (STEC) O157:H7 is a \nfoodborne pathogen, which can lead to the life-threatening Hemolyt -\nic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). There is no treatment available in order \nto reduce HUS outcome up to date. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), \nincluding acetate (A) and butyrate (B), are produced by the intestinal \nmicrobiota. Lactate (L) is the main metabolite of many fermented \nproducts. A, B and L can protect mucosa exposed to inflammatory \ninsults. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of A, B and \nL on modulating STEC pathogenicity. We evaluated the inhibition of \nSTEC growth after 3h culture, EspB production by SDS-PAGE and \nbacterial adherence to Caco-2 cells. We found that 50 mM of A and \nB, and 100 mM of the three compounds inhibited bacterial growth \nsignificantly compared to control: 0;1;10;50 and 100mM (median \nCFU(IQR) x109) A=2.2(1.8-2.7);2.3(2.0-2.6);2.2(1.8-2.4);1.4(1.2-\n2.0);1.1(0.5-2.0);B=2.1(1.9-2.3);1.9(1.8-2.2);1.6(1.5-2.0);1.3(1.0-\n1.4);0.5(0.4-1.0);L= 2.1(1.7-2.5);2.3(1.6-2.6);1.7(1.5-2.1);1.6(1.5-\n1.9);1.1(1.0-1.5); p<0.001, K W test. Then we evaluated if those \nconcentrations that did not inhibit STEC growth had an effect on \nthe expression of EspB, a protein from type three secretion sys -\ntem that is involved in bacterial adhesion to intestinal epithelial \ncells. We did not observe differences on EspB expression by SDS-\nPAGE. However, we observed a significantly reduced percentage \nof bacterial adherence  to Caco-2 cells in the presence of A and B \n1mM compared to control media (median%(IQR): Media=81(69-87); \nA1=13(12-18);A10=35(17-75);B1=8(6-9);B10=52(29-52);L1=52(35-\n52);L10=35(35-40);p<0.05, K W test. \nIn conclusion, acetate and butyrate were able to reduce bacterial ad -\nherence to Caco-2 cells in concentrations that do not inhibit bacterial \ngrowth. Since gut colonization is the first step in STEC pathogene -\nsis, it could be interesting to examine the mechanisms involved in \nthe inhibition of bacterial adherence to epithelial cells.\n164.

Previously, we demonstrated that TB \npatients showed a neuro-immune-endocrine imbalance consisting \nof elevated plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines along with \nan increased cortisol/dehydroepiandrosterone ratio. Former results \nalso revealed elevated lypopolysaccharide (LPS) plasma levels in \nsevere TB. As procalcitonin (PCT) is considered a diagnosis and \nprognosis biomarker in bacterial infections, we evaluated PCT plas -\nma concentration and its association with cytokine and LPS levels in \nTB. PCT plasma levels were assessed by an electrochemilumines -\ncence immunoassay (Elecsys BRAHMS PCT, Roche) in an autoan -\nalyzer. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) were measured \nby commercial enzimoimmunoassays whereas C reactive protein \nwas assessed by an immunoturbidimetric assay (CRP, Wiener-lab). \nLPS plasma concentration was studied by using a commercial \nchromogenic endpoint LPS detection assay. Newly diagnosed TB \npatients (n=37) exhibited increased PCT and LPS values respect \nto age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCo, n=20; p=0.0011 \nand p=0.0007, respectively), mostly in severe cases who showed \nthe highest levels (p<0.0001), with 2-month of specific treatment \nleading to a significant reduction (p=0.0001). At diagnosis, PCT \nlevels correlated significantly with IL-6 (r=0.39, p=0.0092), IFN-\u03b3 \n(r=0.47, p=0.0018), and CRP (r=0.63, p<0.0001). Further analysis \nin the context of TB and type 2 diabetes (DBT) comorbidity, showed \nthat TB-DBT patients had even more increased PCT concentration \nthan TB (p=0.049) or DBT (p=0.0129) patients, in addition to HCo \n(p<0.0001). DBT patients also displayed raised amounts of PCT re -\nspect to HCo (p=0.0062). Increased presence of PCT mirrors the \naccompanying inflammation seen in active TB, preferably in pro -\ngressive disease and during the DBT comorbidity.\n165.

There are no treatments able to eliminate the parasite \nat this stage or to reduce the adverse effects associated with the in -\nfection. Herein, we study the effect of a non-invasive therapy based \non environmental enrichment (EE) on brain parasite load and the \ndamaging effects of infection.\nMETHODS: The EE therapy involves increasing the available space \nand the addition of novel elements in the habitat. Chronically infect -\ned treated (TE), untreated (T) and naive (N) C57BL/6 mice were \nused to evaluate different abilities by the Open Field (OF), Hole \nBoard (HB), Forced Swim (FS) and Novel Object Recognition (NOR) \ntests. Data was analyzed using ANOVA test. Brain cyst burden was \nevaluated at the end. \nRESULTS: OF results evidence that the EE treatment on infected \nmice improved its exploratory ability measured as crossed lines (TE \nvs T p=0,0059) and rearings (TE vs T p=0,008), leading to similar \nlevels than the N mice. We confirmed this result with the HB, where \nTE showed a 2,1-fold increase in nose poke behavior than the T \ngroup, reaching similar records to N (TE vs T p=0,007). The posi -\ntive impact of the therapy was also exposed in the memory-learn -\ning abilities, measured by NOR, since TE showed higher identifi -\ncation index compared to T and similar performance to N (TE vs \nT p=0,0014). Also, the EE improved the TE response to stressful \nsituations previously experienced as measured by the FS (TE vs \nT p=0,0014), with similar results to N. Nevertheless, brain parasite \nload was similar in TE and T groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: This environmental enrichment therapy showed a \npositive impact in all the studied skills, showing its potential to deal \nwith the harmful effects of chronic toxoplasmosis, improving well-be -ing of the affected individuals. This type of non-invasive therapy \ncould be easily incorporated into translational medicine approaches.\n166.

Presently, RT-qPCR \nis considered gold standard test, but requires sophisticated equip -\nment, expertise and is also expensive. \nObjective : We developed a simple colorimetric molecular test for \nSARS-CoV-2 based on Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated iso -\nthermal Amplification (RT-LAMP). Faster, direct, low-cost and ver -\nsatile.\nMethods : we developed the test optimized on nasopharyngeal \nswab (NP) and saliva samples without an RNA isolation. We opti -\nmized of samples pretreatment with lysis buffer and heat-inactivat -\ned, temperature, incubation time, enzymes, dNTPs, primers, other \ncomponents.\nWe used 3 primers set targeting 2 regions of ORF1ab gene and one \nin ORF E gene.

(585) THE POTENTIAL OF SIRTUIN ENZYMES AS DRUG \nTARGETS IN CESTODE PARASITES  \nHugo Rolando Vaca1, Mar\u00eda Agustina Toscanini1*, Ana Mar\u00eda \nCelentano1*, Natalia Macchiaroli2, Mar\u00eda Celina Elissondo3, \nManfred Jung4, Federico Camicia1, Mara Cecilia Rosenzvit1.\n1Instituto de Investigaciones en Microbiolog\u00eda y Parasitolog\u00eda \nMedica (IMPaM, CONICET-UBA), Buenos Aires, Argentina; \n2Instituto de Biociencias, Biotecnolog\u00eda y Biolog\u00eda Trasla -\ncional (iB3, FCEN-UBA), Buenos Aires, Argentina. 3Institu -\nto de Investigaciones en Producci\u00f3n, Sanidad y Ambiente \n(IIPROSAM, CONICET-UNMDP), Mar del Plata, Argentina; \n4Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies, Albert-Ludwigs Uni -\nversity of Freiburg, Germany.\nThe anti-parasitic treatment of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) \ncaused by cestodes, such as echinococcosis and cysticercosis, re -\nlies on a small number of approved anthelmintics that are not well \ntolerated by some patients and often only partially effective. Thus, \nthe identification of novel drug targets is critical. In this work, we \nidentified Sirtuins (SIRTs), a family of NAD+-lysine deacetylases, \nin cestodes and evaluated their potential as drug targets. By bioin -ABSTRACTS129\nformatic analysis of genome data, we identified six SIRT-encoding \ngenes -belonging to SIRTs classes I, III, and IV- in species from \nEchinococcus , Mesocestoides  and Taenia  genera. RNA-seq data \nanalysis in Echinococcus  spp. showed transcriptional expression of \nthese genes throughout several developmental stages; being SIRT2 \nthe most expressed SIRT gene in all analyzed stages. Furthermore, \nwe experimentally determined the anthelmintic effect of SIRT inhibi -\ntors by a motility assay in the cestode model  Mesocestoides vogae . \nThe SIRT inhibitor Mz25 showed a strong and irreversible cesto -\ncidal activity at various concentrations. This activity was time and \ndose dependent and with a value of IC50 significantly lowers than \nthat of the current anthelmintic albendazole.

We randomly assigned children \nwith STEC-HUS to the rHuEPO group (subcutaneous rHuEPO 150 \nU/kg/week + RBC transfusion if hemoglobin \u22647 g/dLand/or hemody -\nnamic instability) or to the usual- caregroup (RBC transfusion if he -\nmoglobin \u22647 g/dL and/or hemodynamic instability). Primary outcome \nwas the number of RBC transfusions received during the hospital -\nization. Secondary outcomes were to explore whether baseline EPO \nlevels were deficient (according to the relation between observed \nand predicted level), to correlate selected acute phase parameters \nwith the number of RBC transfusions, and to assess possible ad -\nverse events.\nResults: Twelve patients per arm were included, all completed the \ntrial. They were comparable at recruitment and coursed a similar \nacute disease. Median number of RBC transfusions was similar be -\ntween groups (1.5, p=0.76). Most patients had appropriate baseline \nEPO levels, which did not correlate with the number of RBC trans -\nfusions (r 0.19, p=0.44). Conversely, baseline (r 0.73, p=0.032) and \nmaximum lactic dehydrogenase levels (r 0.78, p=0.003), creatinine \npeak (r 0.71, p=0.03) and dialysis duration (r 0.7, p=0.04) correlated \nsignificantly with RBC requirements. No potential side effect was \nattributed to rHuEPO therapy.\nConclusion: Administration of rHuEPO did not reduce the number of \nRBC transfusions in children with STEC-HUS.\nINMUNIDAD ADAPTATIVA\n170.

This state of general -\nized lymphopenia prevents an immunogenic reaction against the \nsemi-allogenic fetus, but still allows the immune system to react to \nthe exposition to foreign antigens. B-cells travel from the bone mar -\nrow to the spleen to differentiate. They arrive as Transitional 1 (T1) \nB-cells, and if maturation pathways are activated, they differentiate \ninto T2 B-cells which in turn will originate Marginal Zone (MZ) or \nFollicular (FO) subsets. Lastly, T2 cells can be selected away from \nthe B cell developmental pathway into T3 anergic B-cells. During \npregnancy, our group described an expansion of mature and pre-ac -\ntivated MZ subset of B-cells in the spleen that suggest a compensa -\ntory mechanism of the immune system to guarantee the availability \nof effector B-cells for defense. In this work, our aim was to confirm \nthese results using a genome-wide transcriptome profiling on isolat -\ned splenic B cells from pregnant (P) and non-pregnant (NP) mice. \nUsing the gene expression profiles (GEP) from the mixed popula -\ntion of B-cells subsets, we estimated cell fractions of T1, T2 & T3 \nbased on a matrix of 950 genes using CIBERSORTx deconvolution \ntool ( https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/ ). We observed an abundance \nof GEP of T2-subset in P compared to NP mice (p<0.001, F-test, \nN=4). The relative abundance of T1 GEP was similar in both groups, \nhowever, the proportion of B-cells in NP mice that does not corre -\nspond to T2 subset is in turn represented by T3, which suggests a \nselection against differentiation in NP mice during physiological con -\nditions. These results hints that the differential expression of genes \nin P mice will activate the pathways needed for further differentiation \ninto the MZ subset of B-cells. Further analysis of GEP may allow \nus to predict with more accuracy B-cell redistribution in the spleen MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021130\nduring pregnancy.\n171.

One-week later mice were challenged with virulent B. \nsuis through the intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intratracheal (i.t.) routes. \nCFU counts were determined in lungs and/or spleens 20 days after \nchallenge. Antibodies capacity to neutralize Brucella  infection was \ndetermined in lung epithelial cells culture (A549 cell line).\nVaccination with both OMVs induced serum specific IgG (p<0.0001), \nsera from OMV\u2206 mapB animals reached higher IgG titers than OM -\nVwt group (1600 OMV\u2206 mapB vs 400 OMVwt). In addition, OM -\nV\u2206mapB  mice showed high levels of serum specific IgG1 (51200), \nIgG2a (3200) and IgA (400), while in OMVwt animals only low levels \nof specific IgA were detected (100). A slight increase in specific IgA \nlevels at the respiratory and oral mucosa was detected in mice vac -\ncinated with OMV\u2206 mapB (p<0,01). Serum specific antibodies from \nOMVwt and OMV\u2206 mapB  mice reduced B. suis  adherence to and \ninvasion of A549 cells (p<0.01).\nOMVwt and OMV\u2206m apB immunization achieved the same reduc -\ntion of lung (0.7 log;p<0.05) and spleen (1.2 log; p<0.05) burden \nafter i.t. infection; and a 1.67 log and 2.11 log reduction, respectively, \nof spleen burden after i.p. infection (p<0.0001).\nVaccination with B. suis  wt and \u2206 mapB OMVs induced systemic and \nmucosal specific humoral immune response, which may contribute \nto prevent Brucella  mucosal entry and its dissemination.\n172.

Wherever \nextracellular ATP (a DAMP) becomes abundant in the  body, ectonu -\ncleotidases CD39 and CD73 are considered vital in the  generation \nof an immunosuppressive microenvironment through adenosine \nproduction. Our goal was  to investigate a potential metabolic ad -\naptation of tonsillar B cells, promoting  a suppressive behavior upon \nyears of hyperplasia due to local  chronic inflammation. By analyz -\ning tonsillar mononuclear cells (TMC) using FACS,  we compared \nco-expression of the ectonucleotidases CD73 and CD39 on  CD20+ \ncells at different donor ages. We found that samples from older \npatients presented a statistically significant higher double positive \nCD73+ CD39+CD20+ cell population than those from younger chil -\ndren (37.7% \u00b1 SD 10% vs 25.8% \u00b1 SD 8.8%  respectively, n=40, p<0.01). By culturing TMC with IL2/IL4/CpG/CD40L, we also  show \nthat activated B cells reliably downregulated CD73, presumably to  \nprevent autocrine adenosine signaling. Thus, we found that neither \nIL10+CD20+  cells nor IL17+CD20+, generated upon stimulation, \nexpressed CD73. In contrast,  changes in CD39 expression with B \ncell activation resulted more  variable between patients. Finally, we \nused the percentage of germinal  center B cells (GC) as a read out of \nthe effector immunological activity of the organs. We found that the  \nproportion of GC within CD20+ cell population steadily declined with  \nincreasing age. GC B cells represented approximately one third of  \nall the B cells from tonsils within the (2-9) year  old range (29% \u00b1 SD \n14%). That value declined to 15.7% \u00b1 SD 9.7% in tonsils from 10 to\n18. Differences between  the means were statistically significant \n(n=50, p<0.01). We concluded that  the progression on the cause \nof tonsillar disease with age  might illustrate the adaptation of the \ntonsillar tissue to constant  inflammation.\n173.

In addition, \nupon activation, B1 B cells produce large quantities of the potent an -\nti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Though the mechanisms that control \nnatural antibodies production are not fully elucidated, it was recent -\nly associated with a down-regulation of CD1d expression in B1 B \ncells. Taking into account that both, IL-10 and natural antibodies are \nknown to be fundamental components in pregnancy wellbeing, the \naim of this study was to evaluate proliferation status as well as CD1d \nexpression and IL-10 production by B1 B cells during pregnancy. \nFlow cytometry analysis, on splenic B1 B cells from pregnant (P) \nand non-pregnant (NP) mice was performed to evaluate ki-67 (pro -\nliferation marker) and CD1d expression as well as IL-10 production \nupon LPS stimulation. \nWe observed significantly higher expression levels of Ki-67 in splen -\nic B1 B cells from P compared to NP (Unpaired t-test p<0,0001; n=3) \nmice which was mirrored by higher percentages of B1 B cells in the \nspleen of P mice (Unpaired t-test p=0,0095; n=11). In addition, B1 B \ncells from P mice expressed lower levels of CD1d as compared to \nNP mice (Unpaired t-test p<0,0001; n=3). Furthermore, LPS-stimu -\nlated B1 B cells from P mice produced significantly higher levels of \nIL-10 compared to NP mice in vitro (Unpaired t-test p=0,015; n=5).\nOverall, our results demonstrate that not only B1 B cells are expand -\ned in the spleen during pregnancy but they also seem to acquire the \ncapacity to produce higher levels of natural antibodies and IL-10 \nduring this period, suggesting their critical role in the intricate pro -\ncess of pregnancy tolerance.\n174.

Extracellular ATP increases in inflammatory mi -\nlieus with its concentration being regulated by CD39, mainly ex -ABSTRACTS131\npressed on Tregs. There is no data regarding Tregs and Th17 cell \nbalance in children with COVID-19.\nAims: 1) to analyze the frequency and phenotype of Tregs children \nwith COVID-19 and controls; 2) to quantified the levels of ATP re -\nlease by stimulated PBMCs and in serum; 3) to study the effect of \nextracellular ATP on CD4+ T cell balance.  \nMethods: We used sera, PBMCs and/or purified T cells from children \nwith COVID-19 (n=54) and controls (n=24) to evaluate frequency \nand phenotype of cells subset and proliferative response by flow \ncytometry; ATP levels by luminometry; cytokines levels by multiplex \nassays. \nResults:  We observed a decreased frequency of Tregs in children \nwith COVID-19, mainly in those with severe disease (p<0.01). These \nTregs showed an activated phenotype with a strong suppressive \nprofile including a great expression of CD25, CTLA-4 and CD39. \nSevere patients expressed increased levels of the ectonucleotidase \ncd39 in CD4+ T cells in comparison with non-severe (p<0.05) and \ncontrols (p<0.0001). Additionally, we found that stimulated PBMCs \nfrom severe children released the highest levels of ATP as well. We \nalso detected that ATP promoted a fall in the proliferative response \nof purified T cells (p<0.0001) as well as in the Th1 and Th2 cytokine \npatterns. Interestingly, IL-17A and IL-17F levels did not decrease. As \nexpected, ATP reduced the percentage of FOXP3+ and increased \nthe expression of RORC in T cells, that were abrogated with the \nP2X7R antagonist, showing the involvement of this receptor. Finally, \nthe levels of ATP in plasma correlated inversely with the frequency \nof Tregs.  \nConclusions:  We demonstrate that signaling through purinergic re -\nceptors drives Th17 but impairs Tregs immune response which have \nimplications in the pathogenesis of pediatric COVID-19. \n175.

P. Garrahan - Buenos Aires \n- Argentina\nmail: erralorenzo@gmail.com\nNatural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells play an important role in the im -\nmune response. STX11 encodes a t-SNARE protein necessary for \nthe final fusion of lytic granules with the plasma membrane of these \ncells. Biallelic mutations in STX11 results to a \u201cparticular\u201d Familial \nHemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis type 4. Heterozygous muta -\ntions have been identified in several patients, although the clinical/\nfunctional relevance of these mutations remains poorly understood.\nOur aim was to determine the functional relevance of an heterozy -\ngous STX11 variant (R129P) identified in a pediatric patient diag -\nnosed with Evans syndrome. Targeted sequencing showed that the \npatient\u2019s mother was heterozygous for the mutation.\nPBMC from healthy donors (HD), patient, mother and a patient with \nChediak Higashi syndrome (negative control, NC) were used.\nWe analysed degranulation capacity of CD8+T cells and degranula -\ntion and cytotoxicity ability of NK cells, using flow cytometry assays. \nWe observed a reduction of all these functions in the R129P-STX11 \npatient and mother in comparison to HD. Nevertheless, these re -\nductions were less defective than observed in NC cells. IL-2 in vitro \ntreatment restored these functions.\nThe RNA levels (qPCR) of patient and mother were similar to HD but \nthe protein expression (WB) was reduced.\nFinally, we performed in-silico structural analysis of R129P substi -\ntution using available STX11:Munc18-2 complex structure. R129 is \npart of a helix in the NHabc domain displaying a rich hydrogen bond \nnetwork with Munc18-2. In this context, this variant is expected not \nonly to impact helix stability, but also protein-protein interaction.\nAltogether, we demonstrated that the novel R129P-STX11 mutation \ncan play a pathogenic role by impairing degranulatory activity of NK and CD8+T cells and cytotoxic activity of NK cells. The aberrant \nfunctionality of NK cells have been reported in several autoimmune \ndisorders. This novel mutation may explain the clinical patient Evans \nSyndrome phenotype.\n176.

This bacterium \nwas shown to  prevent the colonization of the respiratory mucosa \nby pathogenic bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae  (Sp). \nWe recently demonstrated that C. pseudodiphtheriticum  090104 \n(Cp), when nasally administered to mice; differentially modulated \nthe respiratory immune responses triggered by TLR2 and improved \nthe resistance to pneumococcal pneumonia. We also reported that \nbacterium-like particles derived from Cp (BPCp) had the ability to \nmodulate the innate respiratory immunity. These results allowed us \nto hypothesize that Cp or BPCp could be used as mucosal adju -\nvants to enhance the respiratory adaptive immunity. In this work, \ninfant Swiss-albino mice were nasally immunized with 6.25 pg of \nPneumovax23\u00ae vaccine (PV), PV plus Cp (108 CFU) or PV plus \nBPCp at days 0, 14 and 28. Seven days after the last immunization \nsamples of bronco-alveolar lavages (BAL) and serum were collected \nfor specific antibodies determinations. In addition, immunized mice \nwere challenged with Sp serotypes 6B or 19F (106 CFU) and the \nresistance to the infection was evaluated 2 days after the challenge. \nMice in the PV+Cp and PV+BPCp groups had significantly higher \nlevels of BAL anti-Sp IgG and IgA (p<0.01) as well as serum IgG and \nIgM (p<0.01) in comparison with mice immunized only with PV. Of \nnote, the PV+Cp immunization was more efficient than PV+BPCp to \nimprove respiratory and serum antibodies levels. PV+Cp and PV+B -\nPCp mice had lower Sp counts in lungs than controls, as well as \nnegative hemocultures. In addition, PV+Cp and PV+BPCp groups \nhad higher levels of BAL and serum TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 (p<0.05) \nthan controls after Sp infection. Again, Cp was more efficient than \nBPCp to induce protection against Sp 6B and 19F. The results show \nthat both Cp and BPCp are promising mucosal adjuvants for the \ndevelopment of nasal vaccines to combat respiratory infections.\n177.

MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021132\nWe tested both hypotheses in murine models of surgical DED by \nrestricting the T cell repertoire [Balb/c (wild-type) vs DO11.10 mice \n(partial ovalbumin-restriction)] and exploring the role of the corneal \nnerve polymodal nociceptor TRPV1, known to trigger neuroinflam -\nmation. We assessed corneal epitheliopathy (CE), corneal mechan -\nical sensitivity (MS), capsaicin sensitivity (CS, TRPV1 agonist), \neye-closing ratio (ECR, pain surrogate) and corneal intraepithelial \nnerve density (IEND).\nRemarkably, DO11.10 mice were capable of developing DED, \nshowing increased CE, decreased MS, ECR and IEND (n=10-16, \np<0.05). However, Balb/c mice developed worse DED, with similar \nMS and ECR but worse CE (n=16, p<0.05) and lower IEND (n=12, \np<0.05). Prior immunization of DO11.10 mice with their cognate \nantigen did not affect DED severity (n=16, p<0.05). Furthermore, \nthe opposite eyes of Balb/c mice with unilateral DED showed low -\ner MS (n=62, day>4, p<0.05), ECR (n=9, day>7, p<0.05) and CS \n(n=9, day>4, p<0.05) and higher CE (n=9, day>4, p<0.05) compared \nwith control eyes, and lost mucosal tolerance later on (day 8). Also, \nTRPV1 antagonist-treated mice developed milder disease with re -\nspect to CE (n=20, p<0.05) and ECR (n=9, p>0.05), and also had \nhigher IEND(n=11, p<0.05).\nThus, T cell repertoire restriction leading to a milder DED pheno -\ntype suggests that antigenic specificity is relevant in DED, while \nimmunization of DO11.10 mice not worsening disease suggests \nthat bystander activation of CD4+ T cells is not. Both findings point \ntowards an still unidentified corneal autoantigen. In addition, both \nthe improvement in DED phenotype by TRPV1 blockade and the \ndisease-like findings in the opposite eyes of unilateral DED mice \nsuggest that TRPV1-initiated neuroinflammation contributes to DED \npathophysiology.\n \n178. (300) CHARACTERIZATION OF SPECIFIC CAMELID \nSINGLE DOMAIN ANTIBODIES, VHH OR NANOBODIES, \nAGAINST HUMAN IgG4 FOR DIAGNOSTIC APPLICATION \nIN IgG4 RELATED DISEASE\nFlorencia A. Marchese, Joaqu\u00edn I. Bozzo, Vanina Grippo.\nInstituto de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda Dr. C\u00e9sar Milstein. CONI -\nCET, CABA, Argentina.\nThe adaptive immune systems of camelids comprise classical \nantibodies and heavy-chain only antibodies (HCAb), where an -\ntigen-binding is mediated by one variable domain, called VHH or \nnanobody (Nb). Nbs present unique characteristics conferring great \npotential in the development of more sensitive diagnostic methods, \nincluding high solubility, physicochemical stability and low produc -\ntion cost. Moreover, Nbs are able to recognize cryptic epitopes, \nnot targeted by conventional antibodies. On the other hand, IgG4 \nis increased in the serum of patients with IgG4 related disease \n(IgG4-RD). Along with other characteristic symptoms, serum IgG4 \nlevels allow the diagnosis of IgG4-RD. For this reason, we aimed to \ncharacterize specific VHH against human IgG4 (hIgG4) for the de -\nvelopment of new tools in IgG4-RD diagnosis. To achieve our goal, \ntwo immune VHH libraries were previously constructed starting from \nllama blood. Specific Nbs against hIgG4 were selected by Phage \nDisplay methodology. The reactivity of 90 selected Nbs was studied \nagainst the four human IgGs by ELISA. As a result, 61 out of 90 VHH \nwere specifically reactive against hIgG4. The diversity of these Nbs \nwas analyzed by fingerprinting, showing 20 different digestion pat -\nterns. From these VHH, the 10 most reactive Nbs were confirmed as \nunique by sequencing. Six of these Nbs were expressed as soluble \nprotein in E. coli  WK6 strain. Then, reactivity of soluble-expressed \nNbs against sera of different species was assessed by Dot Blot. \nFurthermore, the reactivity against all human IgGs was studied by \nELISA, confirming IgG4 specificity. In conclusion, 61 specific Nbs \nagainst hIgG4 were successfully selected by Phage Display. More -\nover, the 10 most reactive out of these 61 VHH showed to be unique. \nSix out of these Nbs were expressed as soluble protein and showed \nhigh reactivity against only hIgG4 in Dot Blot and ELISA. Further \ncharacterization of these Nbs will allow us to develop new tools for \ndiagnostic innovation in IgG4-RD.\n179.

To our knowledge \nthere are no other published reports describing the use of protease \ninhibitors from bacteria as immune vaccine adjuvants.\nBased on these previous results, we studied if other microbial pro -\ntease inhibitors also have adjuvant activity. After an in-silico  screen -\ning using MEROPS database plus literature, we have selected 11 \nprotease inhibitors present in human pathogenic microorganisms \nrepresenting different families of protease inhibitors.\nWe made a screening based on 3 different selection criteria: i) pu -\nrification yield, ii) protease inhibitor activity against gastrointestinal \nproteases and iii) immunostimulatory properties. Our results indicate \nthat 5 putative protease inhibitors can inhibit the protease activity of \ngastrointestinal proteases and pancreatin extract (p<0.001 ANOVA \n+ Bonferroni). We also shown that these molecules have the capac -\nity to activate immune cells. We have found a significant increase \nin the production of IL-6 in BMDCs from C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ \nmice when the cells were stimulated with the protease inhibitors, \ncompared with medium (p<0.001 ANOVA + Bonferroni) in 3 of them. \nFinally, we have found a significant increase in the proliferation of \nOT-I CD8+ T cells after oral administration of OVA plus each of the \n3 bacterial protease inhibitors, compared with OVA alone (*P<0.05, \n**P<0.01 ANOVA + Bonferroni)\nTogether our results show that the new identified bacterial protease \ninhibitors could be mucosal adjuvants, since they are able to in -\ncrease adaptive immune responses to orally co-delivered model Ag.\n180.

MiRNAs are believed to be \ninvolved in the gut inflammation in IBD and to be implicated in the \ntransformation process from chronic inflammation to colorectal can -\ncer (CRC). Besides, mucosal myofibroblasts are key stromal cells \ninvolved in IBD pathogenesis and in the CRC tumor micro-environ -\nment. miR-21-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-31 have repeatedly been \nidentified and seem to be the most studied miRNAs related to IBD. \nIn this work, we aimed to study whether there is differential expres -\nsion of miR-21-5p and miR-155-5p in IBD mucosa, and in intesti -\nnal fibroblasts from IBD patients, compared to CRC patients and \nhealthy control intestinal mucosa, as potential early biomarkers to \npredict CRC outcome in patients with chronic intestinal inflammatory \ndisorders.\nTotal RNA was obtained from mucosal explants from IBD patients, \nhealthy control patients, polyps biopsies and colon tumor biopsies. \nIntestinal fibroblasts were isolated from colon surgical pieces and \nprimary cultures were established. cDNA from biopsies and/or fi -\nbroblasts was obtained and miR-21-5p and miR-155-5p expression \nwas quantified by real time qPCR with specific primers.\nWe detected higher expression levels of miR-21-5p in inflamed tis -\nsue compared to non-inflamed mucosa, as well as in tumor biopsies \nfrom CRC patients, whereas expression of miR-155-5p was lower \nin inflamed mucosa compared to non-inflamed mucosa, as well as \nin  tumor biopsies from CRC patients compared with healthy patient \nbiopsies. \nFurther studies including more samples with different pathological \nfeatures are underway, in order to confirm that the differential ex -ABSTRACTS133\npression of these microRNAs could be a useful tool to predict IBD \noutcome to early prevent CRC onset. \n181.

C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina.\nThe subunit vaccines have many advantages; however, they need \nappropriate adjuvants to enhance immune response. Our group de -\nveloped an adjuvant strategy in which OVA and CpG-ODN are for -\nmulated with a nanostructure (Coa-ASC16) formed by self-assem -\nbly of 6-O-ascorbyl palmitate (ASC16). We have previously shown \nthat this nanoformulation (OCC) elicited stronger OVA-specific anti -\nbodies, and Th1 and CD8+ T-cell responses compared with a solu -\ntion of OVA and CpG-ODN (OC). OCC elicited early IFN-\u03b3 secretion \nin lymph nodes (LN) draining the injection site peaking at 24 h after \ninjection, and this secretion was higher than the one produced by \nthe OC group. Conversely, the IFN-\u03b3 concentration in serum was \nhigher in OC mice than in OCC mice. Here, we study the source of \ninnate IFN-\u03b3 production and its requirement to induce an adaptive \nimmune response. Wilde-type and IFN-\u03b3-deficient mice were sub -\ncutaneously immunized with a single-dose of OC or OCC. LN and \nspleen from wilde-type mice were collected 24 h after injection and \nIFN-\u03b3 producing cells were assessed by flow cytometry after incu -\nbation with RPMI in the presence of Brefeldin A and Monensin at 37 \n\u00b0C 5% C02. The frequency of IFN-\u03b3+ cells found in LN was higher \nin OCC mice than in OC mice (p<0.001), but no differences were \nobserved in spleen. Furthermore, the relative proportion of IFN-\u03b3+ \ncells was different between both groups, the main difference being \nthe increased size of IFN-\u03b3+ NK1.1 cells population in LN of OCC \nmice compared to OC mice (p<0.001). In IFN-\u03b3-deficient mice, OCC \nelicited lower OVA-specific IgG2a titers than in wild-type mice; how -\never, OVA-specific CD4+ T cells proliferation and frequency of SIIN -\nFEKL-Kbtetramer+ CD8+ T cells were not affected. Understanding \nthe mechanism by which adjuvants engage the immune responses \nis critically important for the development of vaccines. Our results \nsupport the hypothesis that early IFN-\u03b3 production is important for \nobtaining productive responses to adjuvanted vaccines.\n182.

The presence \nof atopic diseases in the mother propagates the onset of allergic \ndiseases in the offspring with a considerably stronger penetrance \nthan atopic diseases of the father. Such observation challenges ge -\nnetic predispositions as the sole cause for allergic diseases. Epi -\ndemiological studies suggest that caregiver stress in the perinatal \nperiod may predispose offspring to asthma. We have shown that \nmaternal stress during pregnancy results in an increase of litter sus -\nceptibility to develop allergic lung inflammation OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study if there are sex differences in susceptibility in adult \nmice. METHODS: Pregnant BALB/c mice were subjected to a single \nrestraint stress exposure at day 15 of gestation. Pups were separat -\ned by gender and after puberty and treated with two i.p.injection of \novalbumin (OVA)/alum(day 4 and 47), challenged with antigen aero -\nsol(days 50-52) and euthanized(day 54). Negative controls included \npups of non-stressed dams subjected to the same protocol or i.p. \nsensitized and aerosol challenged with PBS. RESULTS:  Female \nand male adult mice born to stressed dams were more susceptible \nto developing pulmonary allergic inflammation, since an increase in \nthe number of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), a great -\ner peribronchial and perivascular infiltrate, higher proportion of mu -\ncus-producing cells, and increased IL-4 and IL-5 levels in BAL were \ndetected compared to control mice. These parameters were more \npronounced in females than males. Moreover, only females from \nstressed dams showed an increase in IgE levels. CONCLUSIONS: \nIncreased litter susceptibility to develop allergic lung inflammation \ninduced by maternal stress is stronger in females than in male mice. \n183.

Here, we study the effect of vari -\nous vaccine components formulations in the antigen-specific CD8+ \nT cells, germinal center B cells, and Tfh cells. We also evaluate the \neffect of ASC16 sterilization (gamma irradiation) on the immune re -\nsponse. Mice were subcutaneously immunized with a single dose \nof OVA and CpG-ODN nanoformulated with Coa-ASC16 (OCC), an \nOVA and CpG-ODN solution heated and then cooled down to RT \n(OC\u00f8), an OVA solution heated and then cooled down to RT plus \na CpG-ODN solution at RT ( \u00f8O/C), or with an OVA solution at RT \nplus a CpG-ODN solution heated and then cooled down to RT (O/\n\u00f8C). Heating and cooling processes recreated the conditions of the \nnanoformulation preparation. ELISA and flow cytometry techniques \nwere used. In the group of mice immunized with OCC we found a \nresponse higher than the response elicited in the other groups of \nantigen-specific CD8+ T cells (CD3+ CD8+ SIINFEKL-Kb tetramer+) \nin blood 7-days post-immunization (p<0.0001), of Tfh cells (B220- \nCD3+ CD4+ CXCR5+) in the lymph node 10-days post-immunization \n(p<0.05), and of OVA-specific germinal center B cells (CD3- F480- \nCD19+ IgM- IgD- IgG+ GL7+ CD38- OVA+) in the lymph node 14-days \npost-immunization (6-days post-intraperitoneal challenge with OVA/\nCpG-ODN) (p<0.05). No changes were observed in the OVA-specif -\nic immune humoral and cellular response elicited by sterile ASC16 \nvs non-sterile ASC16. These data showed that the nanoformulation \nof vaccine components enhanced the germinal center response, \nwhich led to robust antibody responses. In addition, it was shown \nthat the ASC-16 sterilization process does not affect performance. \n184.

Alterations in the \nmicrobiota composition (dysbiosis) could initiate or enhance autoim -\nmune or inflammatory diseases. Among the factors that cause dys -\nbiosis, the administration of antibiotics is one of the most frequent. In \nthis work we evaluated the impact of acute administration of azithro -\nmycin (AZM) on the intestinal microbiota. Adult male C57BL / 6 mice \nreceived AZM (50 mg /kg/day) in drinking water for 5 days and stool \nsamples were collected  to infers a microbial community structure \nbased on analyses of terminal-restriction fragment length polymor -\nphisms (T-RFLP) of 16S rRNA gen and density for flow cytometry \n(FC), samples of small and large intestine (SI and LI) to evaluate \nmucus by colorimetric method, luminal content to determine meta -\nbolic profiles by GC-MS and proximal and distal mesenteric lymph \nnodes (MLN) to evaluate CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19 lymphoid \nsubsets by FC. After the administration of AZM, the relative abun -\ndances of the main phyla showed modifications with an increase in \nFirmicutes (p <0.001) and a decrease in Bacteroidetes (p <0.001) \ncompared with control group. Analysis of control samples from two \ndifferent years showed a similar composition in terms of phyla, ev -\nidencing the stability of the microbiota in our colony. The antibiotic \nproduced a decrease in mucus levels (30 to 50% in SI and 30 to \n75% in LI); analysis of the colon content of AZM and control groups \nshowed similar profiles. For the lymphoid subsets, main differences \nin percentage of CD19+ cells (p = 0.07) and CD19+ and CD8+ cells \n(p=0.07) were found in proximal and distal MLN respectively. Our \nresults provide microbiological, biochemical and molecular findings \nthat contribute to characterize the intestinal dysbiosis associated \nwith the administration of AZM in adult mice.\n185.

C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina.\nE-mail: ines.crespo@unc.edu.ar\nThe cytotoxic CD8 T cell (CTL) mediated-immune response is cru -\ncial for tumor immunotherapy and for protective immunity against \nintracellular pathogens. Dendritic cells (DC) have the ability to in -\nternalize and present exogenous antigens (Ag) bound to MHC I to \nactivate na\u00efve  CD8 T cells through a process known as cross-pre -\nsentation. Subunit vaccines are often poorly immunogenic and ad -\njuvants are required to boost immunity. The complexity of antigen \ncross-presentation pathways makes difficult to identify therapeutic \ntargets that can act as adjuvants able to generate protective CTL \nresponses. We performed a high throughput screening of libraries of \ndrugs approved by international agencies to identify compounds and \nmolecular pathways capable of enhancing Ag cross-presentation in \nDCs. For it, we developed a high-performance screening method by \nadapting the colorimetric B3Z presentation assay using JAWSII DC \ncell line and Ovalbumin (OVA) as Ag. After assayed 1760 drugs, we \nfound 1.1% of them increased OVA cross-presentation. We validat -\ned these hits and functional analogs by performing dose-response \nassays with both JAWSII and GMCSF BMDCs. Almost all of hits are \nlysosomotropic drugs that could promote biomacromolecules accu -\nmulation. As lipid bodies (LB)-formation has been associated to DCs \ncross-presentation ability, five hits were evaluated for LBs formation \nin JAWSII cells by fluorescence microscopy. We found that Toloni -\num Chloride, Amodiaquine Dihydrochloride and Perhexiline Maleate \nincreased the amount of LBs per cell. None of these five drugs pro -\nduced an important increase neither in the MHCI-surface expression \nnor in the soluble OVA-endocytosis by JAWSII cells. In conclusion, \nwe established a sensitive, fast and robust screening platform for compounds-search capable of stimulating Ag cross-presentation in \nDCs. Although the mechanism of action of these drugs is still under \ninvestigation, our preliminary results indicate that it is likely related \nto lipid metabolism.\n186.

Two cohorts \nof patients samples (n=280) were used in this work. First, serum \nsamples from patients vaccinated with Sputnik V that previously \nhad a positive SARS-CoV-2 qPCR (A); and second, serum samples \nfrom patients vaccinated with Sputnik V that previously had a neg -\native SARS-CoV-2 qPCR (B). Patients had an age range between \n25 and 80 years. To perform the analisys of the antibody levels we \nused proteins Spike and RBD in a single enzyme-linked immuno -\nsorbent assay (ELISA) plate (COVIDAR IgG). Most patients that \nhad COVID-19 presented mild to moderate symptoms. Results are \nexpressed as median (min-max). ANOVA was performed in order to \nstatistical evaluation. RESULTS: antibodies levels in group A were \nsignificantly higher than in group B, both after the first doses 13.4 \n(0.2-16.9) vs 1.4 (0.1-13.5); p<0.001 and the second doses 13.5 \n(2.2-17.4) vs 6.8 (0.1-17.9), P<0.01. In the A group there was no sig -\nnificant differences between the antibodies levels comparing from \n20 days after the first dose vs 20, 90 and 180 days after the second \ndose. Noteworthy, in group B seroconversi\u00f3n did not occur in most \npatients over 45 years old after 20 days of the first dose, unlike what \nwas observed in group A (P<0.001). Antibodies levels in group B \nfrom 20 days after the first dose of vaccine vs 20, 90 and 180 days \nafter the second dose, were significantly higher in groups over 35 \nyears old after the second dose (P<0.05). Concluding remarks, anti -\nbodies levels raised much more after vaccinating patients who previ -\nously had positive qPCR than patients who did not have COVID-19. \nSecond doses would be mandatory to all patients who did not have \nCOVID-19.\n187.

Although there \nare various techniques for this purpose, such as the use of specific \ntetramers or ELISPOT, the activation \u2013 induced marker (AIM) tech -\nnique emerges as a simpler experimental approach. In this work, we \ntested and optimized AIM to analyze the response of CD8+ T cells \nspecific for Trypanosoma cruzi  antigens, generated after infection \nof C57BL/6 mice with the Tulahu\u00e9n strain of T. cruzi . Animals were \ninfected intraperitoneally with 5000 T. cruzi  trypomastigotes. At 12 \ndays post infection, at the peak of the CD8+ T response, the animals \nwere sacrificed and spleens and lymph nodes were harvested. Sple -\nnocytes and lymph node cells were incubated for 15 h with different \nconcentrations of a particular peptide (TsKb20, derived from the \nTransialidase protein or PAR4, derived from the PAR4 protein of the \nflagellum, from T. cruzi ). Cells incubated with Concanavalin A were \nused as a positive control, and non-restimulated cells were used as \na negative control. The specific CD8 response was determined by \nflow cytometry evaluating the activation markers CD25+ and CD69+ \nin the population of CD8+ T cells. Through a two-way ANOVA anal -ABSTRACTS135\nysis, it was found that the specific CD8+ T cell response for TsKb20 \nin infected animals, measured after restimulation with 50 ug/mL \nof the TsKb20 peptide, was significantly higher than the response \nmeasured in uninfected animals. No difference was evidenced in \nthe specific CD8 response for PAR4. These results suggest that the \nAIM technique could be used to determine anti- T. cruzi  specific CD8 \nresponse.\n INMUNIDAD ANTINFECCIOSA\n188. (023) MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS TRIGGERS \nTHE GLYCOLYTIC PATHWAY IN DENDRITIC CELLS \nTHROUGH TLR2 LIGATION\nMariano Maio, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mar\u00edn Franco, Melanie Genoula, \nJoaquina Barros, Mar\u00eda del Carmen Sasiain, and Luciana \nBalboa\nInstituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX)-CONICET, Aca -\ndemia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina\nTuberculosis remains a major global health problem. Its causative \nagent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a highly successful \npathogen that interferes with dendritic cells (DC) functions impair -\ning the onset and development of adaptive immunity. Since several \nstudies are now revealing the importance of metabolic pathways \ninvolved in DC functions, we wondered whether Mtb could regulate \nthe glycolytic activity of DC. \nFor this purpose, we generated monocyte-derived DC from healthy \ndonors and stimulated them with equivalent doses of either irradiat -\ned Mtb (iMtb) or viable Mtb. Thereafter, we evaluated lactate release \nand glucose consumption by enzymatic assays, the expression of \nHIF1a, a transcription factor that promotes the glycolytic pathway, \nand lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), enzyme which catalyzes the \nconversion of lactate to pyruvate, by FACS and/or qPCR.\nWe found that DC stimulated with iMtb or infected with Mtb released \nlactate and consumed glucose at higher rates than untreated-DC \n(P<0.05). In line with it, either iMtb- or Mtb-treatment resulted in \nthe upregulation of HIF1\u03b1 expression at protein and mRNA levels \n(P<0.05), as well as the glycolytic enzyme LDHA (P<0.05). Addition -\nally, we wondered whether the blockade of the main surface TLRs \ninvolved in Mtb recognition, TLR2 and TLR4, may result in an atten -\nuation of the glycolytic pathway in iMtb-stimulated DC. We found \nthat, unlike TLR4 ligation, TLR2 ligation was required to trigger the \nglycolytic pathway in iMtb-stimulated DC (P<0.05). In line with it, the \ntreatment of DC with either synthetic (Pam3Cys) or mycobacterial \n(peptidoglycans) TLR-2 agonists induced both lactate release and \nglucose consumption without affecting cell viability (P<0.05). In sum, \nwe demonstrated that both viable and irradiated-Mtb induce glycol -\nysis in monocyte-derived DC through TLR2 ligation at least at early \ntime of infection. We are currently addressing the functional impact \nof the glycolytic pathway on DC maturation. \n189. (059) EARLY TREG CELL DEPLETION DURING TRY-\nPANOSOMA CRUZI  INFECTION PROMOTES TCONV AND \nCD8+ T CELL IMMUNITY IN THE ACUTE PHASE\nCintia Liliana Araujo Furlan, Santiago Boccardo, Constanza \nRodriguez, Carolina Luc\u00eda Montes, Adriana Gruppi, Eva Vir -\nginia Acosta Rodr\u00edguez\nCIBICI-CONICET, Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica Cl\u00ednica, Fa -\ncultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas, Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3r -\ndoba\nWe reported that after Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc) infection, Tregs un -\ndergo a marked and sustained reduction in frequency. This natural \ncontraction of the Treg response was critical to allow the emergence \nof protective anti-parasite CD8+T cell immunity in the acute phase. \nIn line with this, we previously demonstrated that Treg depletion at \nday (d) 5 post-infection (pi) but not at d11pi impacted on the magni -\ntude of anti-parasite CD8+T cell response and the ability to control \nparasite replication in the acute phase. Thus, we hypothesized that \nTregs may exert a role during early events of T cell priming. In order \nto assess this, DEREG mice were infected with Tc and injected with \ndiphtheria toxin (DT) or PBS at d5 and 6pi. However, DT treatment only induced modest effects on APCs shortly after the injection. \nSpecially, CD86 expression was upregulated on splenic DCs, mac -\nrophages and NKT cells of DT-injected mice in contrast to controls \n(p<0.05), but no differences were observed in the expression of a \nrange of innate immunity activation markers. In turn, we observed a \nsignificant increase in the numbers of Tconv cells of blood and liver \nat d11pi in DT-treated animals compared to control mice (p<0.05). \nThis boost on Tconv cells in Treg-depleted animals was previous to \nthe expansion of anti-parasite CD8+T cells observed at d20pi, sug -\ngesting a correlation between these two populations. Furthermore, \nTconv cells from d11pi of DT-treated mice display an activated/effec -\ntor phenotype, shown by the upregulation of CD44, PD-1 and CD25. \nAt this time point after Treg cell depletion, CD8+T cells upregulate \nmarkers of early activation, however they show no changes in the \nexpression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 nor in effector cell dif -\nferentiation markers such us BATF, IRF4 and T-bet. Altogether, our \nresults suggest that during Tc infection Tregs suppress CD8+T cell \nimmunity at the acute phase through indirect mechanisms that in -\nvolve the previous modulation of the Tconv cell response.\n190.

The aim of this work was to identify the EGPE \nproteins recognized by CE patients\u2019 sera. Materials and Methods: \nEGPE cells were grown in agarose 2% (20000 cells / well) for 5 \ndays. The supernatant of cell colonies was passed through G-pro -\ntein affinity columns performed with sera from patients with 1) CE or \n2) other parasitoses. Eluted proteins were concentrated (3K cut \u2010off \nmembrane concentrator), run in 15% SDS-PAGE, stained, and iso -\nlated for protein identification in CEQUIBIEM (FCEyN, UBA). Molec -\nular modeling of the protein was performed using TrRosetta meth -\nod from Robetta platform. Validation of the model was performed \nby molecular dynamics using NAMD 2.14. Epitope prediction was \nperformed using IEDB (linear epitope prediction and Discotope 2.0) \nand ABCpred. All protocols were approved by the Ethics Commit -\ntee of the \u201cUAI\u201d. Results: The Histone H2A (W6UJM4), a protein \nof 189 amino acids (aa), was identified among other proteins only \nin eluates from CE column. The model was validated. In the 10-\n50 ns section of the trajectory, the averaged potential energy was \n-165510 +/- 190 kcal/mol. The protein has two regions with different \ndynamic behavior: the RMSD for the trajectory taking the averaged \nstructure as reference was 2.76 +/- 0.65 \u00c5 for 1-160 aa region and \n4.59 +/- 1.04 \u00c5 for 160-189 aa region.

Nuclear receptors (NRs) are factors  that may \nmodulate the immune response (IR) and inflammation, with  a role \nin the regulation of homeostasis and bacterial pathogenesis.  With -\nin the NRs, NR4As orphan receptors have emerged as important  \nregulators of immune cell polarization and NF-\u03baB signaling, which \ncan lead to a switch from acute to chronic inflammatory responses. \nNR4A receptors modulate NF-\u03baB activity in a dynamic manner, ei-\nther repressing or enhancing target gene expression. In this sense, \nthis work aimed to evaluate the RNAm expression of NR4A1 and \n2, NFKB1 (Nuclear Factor Kappa B Subunit 1) and its inhibitors, \nNFKBIA and B, in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from TB pa -\ntients, who were classified according to the severity of the disease \ninto mild, moderate and severe. Besides, possible associations be -\ntween them and other plasma mediators of the immune-endocrine \nresponse were also analyzed (IL-6, IL-10, IFN \u03d2, and DHEA). With \nregards to NR41 RNAm levels, they were diminished in TB pa-\ntients with respect to Healthy Controls (HCo) (p=0.03), meanwhile, \nNR4A2 transcript levels in severe TB patients were higher than in \nHCo (p=0.01). On the other hand, NFKBIA and B transcripts were \nalso augmented in TB patients (p<0.05, both of them). When ana -\nlyzing correlations between them, NR4A1 was positively associated \nwith NR4A2, NFKB1, and NFKBIB in HCo, and in moderate TB pa -\ntients  (p<0.05, all of them). NR4A2 was positively correlated with \nNF-\u03baB  (p<0.01) and NFKBIB (p<0.01). In turn, NR4A2 also showed \na negative and a positive association with IFN- \u03d2 (p<0.05) and DHEA  \n(p<0.05) plasma levels, respectively. These results suggest that \nNR4As would  participate during the IR in TB to dampen the chronic  \ninflammatory process.\n192.

Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica Cl\u00ednica, Fa -\ncultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas, Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3r -\ndoba (Argentina).\nChagas disease is characterized by inefficient host immune re -\nsponse during acute phase of infection, enabling the establishment \nof chronic disease. We have recently demonstrated that acute infec -\ntion triggers mitochondrial ROS (mROS) production and mitochondri -\nal alterations in effector CD4 T cells leading to functional alterations \nand apoptosis. The aim of our work was to evaluate the mechanism \ninvolved in the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, and if this \ncould be prevented by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or \nthe mitophagy inducer Nicotinamide Riboside (NR). To achieve this, \nCD4 T cells were isolated from spleen of non-infected (NI), acute \n(AP) and chronic phase (CP) infected BALB/c mice, with 500 trypo -\nmastigotes. Mitophagy was evaluated using mitochondrial potential \nindependent probe (MTgreen) and antibodies for LC3 and LAMP1. \nCells were cultured with or without chloroquine and colocalization \nwas evaluated by confocal microscopy. CD4 T cells from AP cultured \nwith chloroquine did not show  significant increase in MTgreen and \nLAMP1 colocalization compared to  CCCP-treated NI CD4 T cells \nused as positive control  (*p<0,05) suggesting a defect in mitophagy. \nThen, we aimed to evaluate by flow cytometry, mROS production, \nfrequency of cells with damaged mitochondria and apoptosis in ef -\nfector CD4 T cells from AP infected mice treated with NAC, NR and \nvehicle as control. We did not found differences between NAC and \ncontrol group. In contrast, NR treatment reduced the percentage of \nCD4 T cells with damaged mitochondria (*p<0.05), although we did \nnot observed difference in mROS production. Moreover, apoptosis frequency was also diminished (**p<0.01). Depolarized mitochon -\ndria accumulation, probably due to a defect in mitophagy, could be \nrestored by NR, and thus prevent apoptosis. Taken together, this \nevidence stablishes association between accumulated damaged \nmitochondria, and impaired mitophagy leading to apoptosis in CD4 \nT cells during acute T. cruzi  infection.\n193.

The main difference found was \nthe early appearance of specific anti-STEC (aSTEC) and anti-Stx \nantibodies (aStx) in BALB. The aStx developed by infected BALB \nnot only protected them against an intravenous (i.v.) Stx challenge, \nbut also passive immunization with their sera protected C57 after \nSTEC infection. The aim of this work is to determine if B cell-depen -\ndent response triggered after infection is necessary to guarantee the \nsurvival of infected BALB. \nWe administered a single i.v. dose of anti-B220 antibody (aB220; 4 \nmg/mouse) to BALB to deplete B cells. We analyzed the percentage \nof CD19 positive cells (%CD19+) in mesenteric lymph node (MLN) \nand spleen at different times (4, 24 and 48 h) by flow cytometry. This \ntreatment induced a significant B cell depletion in MLN at 4, 24 and \n48 h vs controls (control vs B-depleted: 4, 24 and 48 h, p<0.001; \nANOVA). %CD19+ cells in spleen at 4, 24 and 48 h were significantly \nlower than controls; however, at 48 h the %CD19+ cells in B-deplet -\ned mice started to increase (control vs B-depleted: 4, 24 and 48 h, \np<0.0001; B-depleted at 48 h vs B-depleted at 4 and 24 h, p<0.05; \nANOVA). \nTo study the role of specific B-dependent response, i.v. aB220 or \nPBS were administered to BALB 1 h before and 3 h post infection. \nTo guarantee B-cell depletion, aB220 injection was repeated twice \na day till the third day of infection intraperitoneally. B-depleted mice \nshowed increased mortality rates (p<0.05, Log-Rank test), higher \nurea levels (p<0.05, t test) and a significant weight loss on day 3 \np.i. (p<0.0001, ANOVA). Also, they didn\u2019t develop significant levels \nof aSTEC IgA at day 4 p.i., assayed as IgA coated bacteria by flow \ncytometry (p<0.01, t test).\nWe concluded that B cell stimulation and the consequent antibody \nresponse play a key role in protection against STEC infections.\n194.

Here, we report \nthe case of a 9-year-old girl with persistent viral shedding based on \nRT-PCR detection. Her first positive (Ct=36) dated from March 4 \n2021, came in a preoperative physical examination (scheduled ton -\nsillectomy), with no apparent symptoms. Her father fell ill and tested \npositive soon after that casual finding. Surgery was postponed. The \npatient came positive again on July 1 2021 (Ct=33) and on July 29 \n2021 (Ct=29). She had a persistent cough, which was also compat -\nible with her allergic condition. Her surgery could not be postponed \nany longer and was operated on July 30 2021. Excised adenoids \nand tonsils were extensively rubbed with a swab to test whether the \nmaterial detected resulted infectious or not, on Vero E6 cell cultures. \nBased on the absence of any cytopathic effect, we found it was not \ninfective, even upon an intended amplification by a second passage. \nRT-PCR was negative when performed on the last supernatant. The \nhistological pattern of her tonsillar and adenoid tissue was analyzed \nthrough H&E staining and immune cell populations were examined \nby FACS. Both aspects were compatible with her hyperplastic con -\ndition and also with a viral infection. We tested the anti-Spike spe -\ncific response by ELISA on serum samples taken on Aug 6 2021 \n(IgM=1.34, cut off=0.584 and IgG=3.27, cut off=0.364). Finally, we \ndetermined the neutralizing antibodies titer on the same serum, us -\ning the wild type SARS-CoV-2 (titre=32, the mean of infected adults \nis 64). We concluded that, albeit the long period the genetic material \nof the virus was detected on her swabs, the patient does not seem to \nhave a major immunological deficiency and could mount an appro -\npriate immune response against the virus. Importantly, we demon -\nstrated she was not able to transmit virus at the time of the surgery.\n195.

Charney Division of Car -\ndiology, New York University School of Medicine, New York.\nGrowing evidence demonstrates a critical role of purinergic system \nin the modulation of the immune response and to determine the \noutcome of infections. Damaged cells release the pro-inflammatory \nmolecule ATP, which is metabolized by the ectonucleotidases CD39 \nand CD73 to the anti-inflammatory mediator adenosine (ADO).\nThe mechanisms involved in the induction of CD4 T cell population \nwith cytotoxic effector functions (CD4 CTL) have not been evaluated \nin the setting of experimental T. cruzi infection. Here, we explored \nthe effect of CD73 activity abrogation (CD73KO) on the differentia -\ntion and functional capacity of the CD4 CTL population in T. cruzi  \ninfected mice.\nThrough flow cytometry, we found that expression of multiple effec -\ntor molecules (granzyme B, perforin, IFN- g and TNF\u03b1) and the de -\ngranulation marker, CD107a, were increased in CD4 T spleen cells \nof CD73KO mice compared to WT mice at 14 days post-infection \n(dpi) (p <0.05). Moreover, deficient CD4 cells exhibited higher cyto -\ntoxicity capacity evaluated by in vitro  cytotoxicity model (% of dead \ncells WT vs KO: p<0,05).\nFurthermore, the frequency of CD4 CTL and their multifunctional \ncapacity decreased when CD73-deficient cells were cultivated in an \nADO-enriched medium (CD73KO vs CD73KO+ADO: p<0,05). As \nexpected, when WT cells were cultivated in an ATP-enriched medi -\num, to mimic CD73-deficient environment, an increase in the mul -\ntifunctional capacity of CD4 CTL was observed (WT vs. WT+ATP: p<0.05) reaching similar levels as was observed for these popula -\ntions in CD73KO cells. \nDuring acute (21dpi) and chronic (258 dpi) phase of the infection, \nthe frequency of infiltrating CD4 CTL was higher in CD73KO cardiac \ntissue associated with diminished parasite burden (measured by re -\nal-time PCR), compared to the WT counterpart (p<0.05).\nThese data suggest that CD73 activity and ADO balance frankly in -\nfluence the functionality of CD4 CTL during the immune response \nagainst T. cruzi  infection.\n196.

Three \nanimals were challenged in two mammary quarters with S. aureus  \n806 strain (non-persistent NP) or 5011 strain (persistent P), and \nthree animals were inoculated in two mammary quarters with saline \nsolution (control group). Milk samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, \n3, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days post inoculation(pi) and bacteriological and \nquality milk examination, somatic cell count (SCC), nitrite, lactoferrin \n(Lf) and cytokines levels (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-4) were evaluated. The \nNP strain (806) was able to induce mild clinical mastitis, triggering \na rapid and effective inflammatory response to control IMI. The P \nstrain (5011) was able to induce a subclinical IMI, triggering a less \nand later inflammatory response than the NP strain. A significant \neffect of infection was observed in SCC and nitrites concentration \nover time (p<0.001, p=0.041 respectively), finding differences be -\ntween groups. Only in mammary quarters inoculated with P strain, \nnitrite levels increased at 21 days pi. For Lf levels, a significant effect \nof infection was observed over time (p=0.004), finding differences \nbetween the groups. Maximum Lf concentrations were detected in \nquarters inoculated with NP strain, where an increase was observed \nsince day 3 pi. A significant effect of infection was observed in IL-\n1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-4 levels over time (p=0.001, p<0.001 and p<0.001 \nrespectively), finding differences between groups. The levels of the \nthree cytokines were higher in quarters inoculated with NP strain \ncompared to P strain. Results confirm previous in vitro  studies sug -\ngesting that the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the dif -\nferent S. aureus  strains and their ability to adapt to the MG deter -\nmine the type of immune response induced in the host.\n197.

UBA-CONICET, CABA, Argentina.\n2 CITIID, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.\nBACKGROUND.  The HIV-1 reservoir comprises a pool of infected \nCD4+ T cells in which the expression of the viral genome remains \nlatent, constituting the main barrier to a sterilising cure. The \u2018shock \n& kill\u2019 strategy involves reactivating HIV-1 transcription in these cells \nto facilitate their elimination. Candidate Latency Reversal Agents \n(LRAs), however, have failed in clinical trials. There is, therefore, MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021138\nan unmet need to develop new approaches aimed to reactivate viral \ntranscription. Considering that high salt concentrations are a com -\nmon finding in secondary lymphatic organs, here we study its effect \non HIV-1 latency.\nMETHODS.  In this study, we exploit a Jurkat cell line latently infect -\ned with an HIV-1 clone containing GFP in place of the viral gene nef \n(J-Lat). We expose J-Lat cells to control or hypernatremic media \n(+50 mM NaCl) for 4 h before treatment with LRAs. HIV-1 reactiva -\ntion, monitored by GFP, is measured by flow cytometry after 24 h. To \nevaluate the role of p38 and NFAT5 we silence the expression of the \nproteins with shRNAs. To measure the activity of NF-\u0138B we use a re -\nporter cell line together with the degradation of IKB\u03b1 by western blot.\nRESULTS.  First, we find that transient exposure to hypernatremic \nmedia sensitises J-Lat cells to HIV-1 latency reversal by two LRAs \n(PMA: 5,2 \u00b1 2,4% vs. 17,7 \u00b1 4,7% and TNF-\u03b1: 10,2 \u00b1 2,6% vs. 30,7 \n\u00b1 10,0%; control vs. hypernatremic media, n = 4, p < 0,001). Then, \nwe confirm this effect is independent of the activity of MAPK p38 and \nthe transcription factor NFAT5. Finally, we analyse the transcription -\nal activity of NF-\u0138B and observe a significant (p<0.01) exacerbation \nof this pathway in cells exposed to hypernatremic media.\nCONCLUSIONS.  Here, we have shown that transient exposure to \na high NaCl concentration, reflecting those encountered in different \ntissue microenvironments, sensitised CD4+ T cells to LRA-induced \nviral reactivation. Understanding the mechanisms involved might \nlead to new therapies to counteract HIV-1 latency.\n198. (262) EVALUATION OF THE ROLE OF TISSUE REPAIR \nREGULATORY T CELLS DURING ACUTE Trypanosoma \ncruzi INFECTION\nSantiago Boccardo, Cintia L Araujo Furl\u00e1n, Constanza Ro -\ndriguez, Carolina P Abrate, Laura Almada, Adriana Gruppi, \nCarolina L Montes, Eva V Acosta Rodr\u00edguez\nCIBICI - CONICET.

Universi -\ndad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba\nTissue repair regulatory Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells (trTreg) are a special -\nized subset that exhibit tissue-specific phenotypic, functional and \ntranscriptional profiles. trTreg maintain tissue homeostasis and also \ndisplay conventional immunoregulatory properties. T. cruzi  (Tc) trig -\ngers a strong effector response that controls parasite spreading but \npromotes pathological tissue damage. We previously showed that \nduring the acute phase of Tc infection, there is a reduction in trTreg \nfrequency and numbers in Spleen (Sp), Skeletal Muscle (SM) and \nother tissues that correlates with decreased systemic levels of their \ngrowth factor IL-33 and increased markers of tissue damage. We \nalso found that trTreg, obtained from infected spleen, can be ex -\npanded in-vitro  by IL-33.\nIn the current work we aimed to increase trTreg numbers in Sp and \nSM of acutely infected (INF) mice to evaluate their impact on dis -\nease progression. To this end, Foxp3-GFP C57BL/6 mice infected \nwith 5000 Tc parasites (Tulahuen) were treated on days 12, 15 and \n18 post infection (pi) with intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection of \nIL-33 or PBS. Sp and SM infiltrate was evaluated by flow cytometry \nat day 20 pi. Systemic IL33 treatment (Tx) induced a mild expan -\nsion of (ST2+KLRG-1+) trTreg in spleen but not in SM, producing no \nchanges on parasite-specific CD8+ T cells or pro/anti-inflammatory \nmacrophage numbers, total body or SM weights, % of survival, bio -\nchemical markers of tissue damage levels and parasitemia. Local \nIL33 Tx could not increase SM trTreg numbers and had no effects \non any of the parameters mentioned above. Both Tx could, however, \nexpand ILC2 in INF mice and trTreg in non-INF animals, indicating \nfunctional response to IL-33 in these settings. \nConsidering these data, we speculate that acute Tc infection may \ninduce signals that could counteract IL33 effect on trTreg. Future \nstudies will be aimed at identifying these signals in order to be able \nto modulate trTreg and, likely, tissue damage during infection.\n199.

We have previous -\nly demonstrated that infection of human macrophages with Ba di-\nminishes the IFN- \u03d2-induced MHC-I surface expression. One of the \nPAMPs that triggers this down-modulation is Ba RNA. MHC-I total \nexpression is not altered, instead these proteins are retained within \nthe Golgi Apparatus (GA). However, we acknowledged whether this \nevent could be triggered in other cells able to be infected with Ba. \nSo, we started by stimulating the lung epithelium cell line (Calu-6) \nand the endothelial microvasculature cell line (HMEC) with different \ndoses of Ba RNA in the presence of IFN- \u03d2. MHC-I expression was \nassessed by flow cytometry. Ba RNA (10 ug/ml) diminished the IFN-\n\u03d2-induced MHC-I surface expression (p<0.05) in both cell lines. To \nstart evaluating whether MHC-I molecules were retained in GA, we \nperformed confocal microscopies of Ba RNA-treated Calu-6 cells in \nthe presence of IFN- \u03d2 (for 48 h). We observed that there is colo -\ncalization of MHC-I and GA marker GM130, although to a lesser \nextent than human macrophages (p<0.05). Conversely to what we \nexpected, supernatants from Calu-6- Ba RNA-treated cells had high -\ner IL-8 production compared to those from untreated cells (p<0.05). \nIL-10 and TNF-\u0251 were not detected in supernatants from Calu-6-\nBa RNA-treated cells when compared to supernatants from mac -\nrophages stimulated with Ba RNA (p<0.05). Our preliminary results \nalso show that Ba infection of Calu-6 diminished the IFN- \u03d2-induced \nMHC-I surface expression. Despite the need for more studies, to -\ngether these results show that Ba could persist successfully within \nthe host, remaining unnoticed and evading CD8+ T cell surveillance.\n200. (280) B. ABORTUS  RNA ACTIVATES MACROPHAGES \nTOWARDS A PRO-INFLAMMATORY PROFILE EARLY ON \nDURING INFECTION\nAgustina Serafino, Jos\u00e9 L. Marin Franco, Luis A.

These pathogens can survive inside macrophages, persisting \ninside the host. We previously demonstrated that Brucella abortus  \n(Ba) RNA is a PAMP involved in the immune evasion mediated \nby Ba. One of the mechanisms displayed by this bacterium is the \ndown-modulation of MHC molecules when Th1 response is being \nheld, i.e., in the presence of IFN- \u03d2. Nevertheless, we acknowledged \nwhether Ba RNA could activate macrophages early on during the \ninfection, before Th1 response is settled. To evaluate this, M0 (undif -\nferentiated) macrophages were stimulated with Ba RNA (10 \u03bcg/ml) \nand at 24 and 48 h M1 (classical macrophages) or M2 (alternative \nmacrophages) markers were assessed by flow cytometry. Regard -\ning M1 markers, CD86 and MHC-II expressions did not change nei -\nther at 24 nor 48 h. Surprisingly, CD64 expression was reduced in \nBa RNA treated macrophages (p<0.05). Ba RNA stimulates the se -\ncretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-\u0251 and IL-1\u03b2) only at \n24 h (p<0.05). With respect to M2 markers, CD206 expression was \nreduced at 48 h in Ba RNA-treated macrophages (p<0.05) but DC-\nSIGN and CD163 expressions did not change compared to untreat -\ned cells. Ba RNA induced IL-10 secretion, mostly at 24 h (p<0.05). \nWe also performed functionality assays of M1 macrophages. Nitrite \nOxide production (assessed by Griess reaction) was stimulated in \nBa RNA treated macrophages at 24 h (p<0.05). Moreover, glucose \nconsumption and lactate production were also augmented by Ba \nRNA (p<0.05), all hallmarks of M1 profile. These results show that \nBa RNA can activate macrophages into a pro-inflammatory profile \n-at least for a short time- early on during infection. These results also \nlay the ground for studying more deeply the modulatory properties \nof bacterial RNA in the context of brucellosis, other intracellular in -\nfections and tumors.\n201.

We have previously reported that neutrophils (PMN) failed to  \nrelease neutrophil-extracellular-traps (NET) when challenged with \nKp. Our aim was  to deepen the study of evasive mechanisms of \nPMN responses,  mediated by Kp. For this purpose, we determined \nNETos is on purified PMN in response to a Kp MOI  10 and/or PMA \n50nM, a potent NET inducer. NET release  was quantified after 3 h \nusing confocal microscopy after DNA  and Elastase staining. Also, \nNET-associated DNA released by nuclease treatment  was mea -\nsured in the supernatants.\nWe found that Kp was able to decrease NETosis induced \nby PMA (NETs area, \u03bcm2: Ctrl=944\u00b1326, Kp=1250\u00b1605, \nPMA=78781\u00b121065*; PMA+Kp= 34513\u00b113420# ; Released DNA, \nng/mL:Ctrl=137,9\u00b119,4, Kp=155,7\u00b112,7, PMA=448,9\u00b185,2*; \nPMA+Kp=299,8\u00b154,6# ;\n*p<0.05 vs. Ctrl and Kp, # p<0.05 vs. PMA; n=6).

PMA induced  lactate release while Kp did \nnot (Lactate release, mg/dl: Ctrl=6,1\u00b11,1,  Kp alone=not detectable, \nPMN+Kp=7,5\u00b11,3 ; PMA=17,9\u00b14,5*;\n*p<0.05 vs. Ctrl and Kp;  n=6).\nMoreover, we study the release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8,  two key inflam -\nmatory cytokines induced by different activation pathways, using  \ncommercial ELISA kits. PMN were incubated 4 h with MOI  10 of Kp \nor E.coli (Eco), as positive control, and  supernatants were collected \nfor IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 measurement. Kp was  able to induce IL-8 release, \nbut did not produce IL-1\u03b2  release. (IL-1\u03b2, pg/ml: Ctrl=32,4\u00b15,4, \nKp=80,9\u00b148,3, Eco=1270,2\u00b1106,7*; IL-8, pg/ml: Ctrl=110,9\u00b186,1, \nKp=5278,1\u00b1218,8*,  Eco=6278\u00b1389*, *p<0.05 vs. Ctrl; n=3).\nIn summary, Kp inhibits NET osis induced by PMA, which could be \nrelated to a poor lactate production.

We evaluated the \nrole of these receptors in the response to respiratory infection by \nBrucella abortus .\nIn vitro  infections on samples from knock-out (KO) and wild type \n(WT) mice revealed that STING, but not cGAS, restricts intracellu -\nlar growth of B. abortus  in murine lung explants (LE) and alveolar \nmacrophages (AM) at 24h (p<0.05) and 48h (p<0.005) post-infec -\ntion (p.i.). Moreover, STING KO AM secreted lower levels of TNF-\u03b1 \n(p<0.05), IL-1\u03b2 (p<0.005) and IL-6 (p<0.0005) at 48h p.i. These \nthree cytokines were also reduced in STING KO LE (p<0.0005), as \nwas also IP-10 (p<0.05).\nBrucella  usually disseminates systemically after airborne infection. \nAfter intratracheal infection with B. abortus,  STING KO mice dis -\nplayed a significantly higher bacterial burden in lungs (p<0.0005), \nliver (p<0.05), and spleen (p<0.005) at 7 p.i. compared with WT \nanimals (similar differences for 14 d p.i.). STING KO AM obtained \nex vivo  after infection evidenced less protein expression of p-NF-\n\u03baB and caspase-1 by Western Blot. In concordance with these re -sults, we detected lower levels of TNF-\u03b1 (p<0.05), IL-1\u03b2 (p<0.05), \nIL-6 (p<0.005) and IP-10 (p<0.05) in bronchioalveolar lavage flu -\nid of STING KO mice at 7 d p.i. In STING KO lung homogenates, \nwe found lower levels of TNF-\u03b1 (p<0.0005), IL-1\u03b2 (p<0.005), IL-6 \n(p<0.005), IP-10 (p<0.0005), and lower IFN -\u03b2 expression (p<0.05). \nFurthermore, we detected lower concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 (p<0.0005), \nIL-6 (p<0.05), and IP-10 (p<0.005), and lower IFN -\u03b2 expression \n(p<0.05) in spleen homogenates of STING KO mice.\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that STING plays an essen -\ntial role in the local and systemic immune response to respiratory \nB. abortus infection, both by reducing the intracellular growth of the \npathogen and enhancing the cytokine response.\n203.

Thus, the inclusion of both sex -\nes in studies of immune function becomes increasingly imperative. \nUsually, vaccine research against T. cruzi  (Tc) has been focused on \nantibody response evaluation. Thus, we aim to evaluate possible \nvariations in humoral and cellular response induced after exper -\nimental vaccine administration against Tc between BALB/c males \n(M) and females (F). Thus, mice (n=5/group) were immunized in -\ntranasally [3 doses, one every 2 weeks with 10\u00b5g of TS emulsified \nin ISPA (I) or c-di-AMP (A) adjuvants]. Controls were treated with \nsaline (S) or TS alone. Fifteen days after the last immunization, in \nvivo cell-mediated (delayed hypersensitivity test -DHT-) and specific \nhumoral (ELISA) responses were assayed. Later, mice were oral -\nly challenged with 3000 Tc (sub-lethal challenge). Parasitemia and \nclinical score were evaluated until day 100 post-infection (pi). In both \nM and F, the DHT was higher in TS+I and TS+A groups compared \nto their respective controls (p<0.05 in all cases). Nevertheless, DHT \nwas always enhanced in F than M (p<0.05 in all cases). TS-specific \nIgG2a and IgG1 levels observed in TS+I or TS+A immunized F were \nincreased compared to S or treated with TS alone (p<0.05 in both \ncases). In comparison, M showed no differences in both subclasses \nof antibody levels between all groups, and in addition, their levels \nwere minor than F (i.e., IgG2a p<0.05). After oral infection, M showed \nmore enhanced parasitemias than F, being significantly different \nbetween TS+I and TS+A (i.e., 17 days pi, F vs M p<0.05 in both \ncases). Moreover, circulating parasites disappear one week later \nin M than F. Clinical affectation was also less evident in F than M \n(clinical score, p<0.05). We can conclude that there are substantial \ndifferences in the immunogenic and protective effects of TS-based \nvaccine formulations between M and F. \n204.

Although there are drugs for its treatment, MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021140\ncurrently there are no prophylactic vaccines to combat the disease. \nHere, we evaluated the immunogenicity and prophylactic efficacy \nagainst oral infection generated by a N-terminal recombinant frag -\nment of Trans-sialidase (TSNt), containing different B and T epitopes \nconfirmed by bioinformatics. For mucosal immunization, 10\u00b5g of \nTSNt was combined with different adjuvants: c-di-AMP(A) or ISPA(I). \nThus, female BALB/c mice (n=6/group) were immunized intranasally \n(3 doses, one every 2 weeks). As control groups we used mice not \nimmunized (NI) or only treated with TSNt. To evaluate the immuno -\ngenicity, 15 days after the last immunization, we performed an in \nvivo cell-mediated test (delayed hypersensitivity test, DHT), splenic \nmultifunctional T cell (IFN\u03b3+/ROR\u03b3t+) detection by flow cytometry \nafter in vitro  stimulation with TSNt, and specific humoral response \nby ELISA. Next, we evaluated prophylactic efficacy during acute \nphase. Thus, animals were orally challenged with 3000 Tulahuen \nstrain/mice (sub-lethal challenge). Parasitemia, clinical affectation \n(score), muscle and liver damage (plasma CK, GOT, GPT) was also \nassessed. In terms of immunogenicity, TSNt+A and TSNt+I vaccines \ndeveloped an enhanced DHT until 72 h, compared to control groups \n(in all cases, p<0.05). Moreover, the same groups showed enhanced \nlevels of IgG2a and IgG1 (in all cases, p<0.05). Multifunctional CD4+T \ncells able to secrete both IFN\u03b3 and IL-17 were enhanced in TSNt+A \nsplenocytes (p<0.05 vs. NI). Clinical affectation was less evident in \nTSNt+A and TSNt+I groups, while parasitemia and muscle and he -\npatic damage were fewer in TSNt+A animals (in all cases, p<0.05). \nTaken together, these results suggest that TSNt+A formulation may \nbe a good vaccine candidate for the development of a prophylactic \nmucosal vaccine against oral T. cruzi  infection. \n205.

Universidad Nacional \nde C\u00f3rdoba\nIn acute phase of T. cruzi  infection, both innate and adaptive immu -\nnity are necessary to control parasite replication. Macrophage (Mf) \nand T cells orchestrate the inflammatory response that controls par -\nasite burden. However, an exacerbated immune response results in \ntissue damage, mainly by ROS and RNS release. Metformin (Mf), a \ntype 2 diabetes drug, reduces inflammation in models of aging and \npollution. In our in vivo  model of T. cruzi  infection in Balb/c mice, \nwe observed that peritoneal and spleen Mf increase iNOS expres -\nsion during acute phase. Pretreatment of BMDM with Mf prevents \nintracellular parasite replication and promotes proinflammatory cyto -\nkine production. We also infected RAW cells and then were treated \nwith PBS or Mf 1mM. This treatment decreased ROS production \n(p<0.05). Peritoneal cells (PC) of infected mice treated 48 h with \nMf reduce ROS production and iNOS expression assesed by flow \ncitometry (p<0.05). To determine the effect of Mf in T. cruzi  infection, \nwe infected i.p. mice with 500 trypomastigotes (tp) and then were \ntreated with PBS or 100 mg/kg of Mf daily by gavage. At 18 d.p.i. \nwe obtained blood samples, spleen, inguinal lymph nodes (LN) and \nPC, including control mice groups. Parasitaemia were assessed in \nboth groups of infected mice showing less tp/mL in Mf treated mice \n(p<0.05). We found that both peritoneal infected Mf subsets, LPM \nand SPM increase mROS production (p<0.001) but Mf has no effect \nneither cROS/mROS production nor iNOS expression. Spleen Mf \nshowed more iNOS+ cells in response to infection and Mf exhibited \na slight revert. In LN, CD169+ Mf capture and prevent pathogens \nspread and initiate immune response driving B cell activation. We \nfound a decrease in CD169+ Mf in infected mice that Mf could not \nrestore. Surprisingly, these remaining cells showed more percent -\nage of iNOS+ Mf (p<0.05). These results suggest that Mf could be a \npromising anti-inflammatory molecule to control tissue damage and \nmodulate immune response to T. cruzi .\n206.

The treatment of this disease \nfails due to the high incidence of antimicrobial resistance\nand the ability of the bacteria to form biofilms and to persist in the \nbone for decades.

Ex vivo  assays using bone marrow cells obtained 48 hours \npost-challenge showed that immunization against SpA reduced \npriming of osteoclast precursors ( p<0.01). Fourteen days post-infec -\ntion TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels were significantly decreased in bone of \nimmunized mice compared with the placebo group ( p<0.01). Bone \nhistomorphometric analysis and qRT-PCR determinations revealed \nthat the number of osteoclasts per bone perimeter ( p<0.05), the os -\nteoclast surface per bone surface ( p<0.05) and cathepsin K expres -\nsion ( p<0.05) were significantly reduced in the immunized group. \nMoreover, the amount of trabecular bone in mice immunized was \ncomparable to the control group inoculated with PBS (non-signifi -\ncant) whereas a significant loss in trabecular bone was observed \nduring infection in the non-immunized group ( p<0.01). These results \ndemonstrate the feasibility of using anti-SpA antibodies in vivo  to \nblock the inflammatory response and bone damage induced by S. \naureus  during osteomyelitis.\n208.

Thus, we evaluated in the \nheart tissue from CCM and seronegative (Co) individuals subject to \ncardiac transplant (n=3/group), inflammatory infiltrates and fibrosis \n(by H&E and trichome stain) and the expression of chemotactic/hap -\ntotactic factors as fibronectin (FN), CXCL12 and TNF\u03b1 (by immuno -\nfluorescence). In addition, we determined in PBMCs from CCM and \nCo (n=20/group) the expression of HLADR as an activation marker \nand VLA4 (FN receptor) by cytometry and TNFR1/2 by RTqPCR. \nMoreover, GC sensibility was estimated by GC receptors (GR\u03b1 as \nfunctional receptor and GR\u03b2 as inhibitor receptor) and 11\u03b2-HSD1 \n(catalyzes the conversion of GC from inactive to active form) expres -\nsion by RTqPCR. CCM tissue sections exhibited obvious infiltrates \nand fibrosis and an increased immunoreactivity for FN, CXCL12 and \nTNF\u03b1 (p<0,05 vs Co). HLADR and VLA4 expression was enhanced \non T lymphocytes from CCM patients (p<0,05 vs Co). In CCM PB -\nMCs, the expression of RG\u03b1 do not differ from the Co group. In our \nsamples, RG\u03b2 was not detectable, while the mRNA of the enzyme \n11\u03b2-HSD was found to be increased in the CCM group (p<0.05 \nvs Co). Conclusion: The increased expression of chemotactic and \nhaptotactic factors in the hearth of CCM patients could promote the \nrecruitment and accumulation of activated T cells, driven in part, by \nenhanced expression of the FN receptor VLA4. The proinflammato -ry phenotype seen in these patients not seems to be linked to GC \nsensibility in immunocompetent cells.\n209. (407) COVID-19 PANDEMIC. LABORATORIO DE MEDICI -\nNA GEN\u00d3MICA DE LA FACULTAD DE MEDICINA DE LA \nUNNE EXPERIENCE IN THE DETECTION OF INFECTED \nAND/OR VACCINATED PATIENTS\nFerrini, M; Acevedo, G; Gim\u00e9nez, Y; Zimmermann, M. \nLaboratorio de Medicina Gen\u00f3mica. Facultad de Medicina. \nUNNE  carlazimmermann@gmail.com\nINTRODUCTION: In December 2019, the World Health Organiza -\ntion was informed of an ongoing global pandemic coronavirus dis -\nease 2019 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus, SARS-COV-2. \nCOVID-19 represents an enormous society burden, affecting the \neconomy and sanitary systems all over the world. A timely and accu -\nrate diagnosis are essential for disease propagation control.\nOBJECTIVE: The main object of the present work is to compare the \nimmunological response of oncologic patients who has overcome \nthe disease or who has been vaccinated, independently of dose or \ntype of vaccine received.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: 211 patients were study. Comor -\nbidity, type and doses of vaccines, previous COVID-19 infections, \nsymptoms and other concerns where assess in order to compare \nresults. Of total patients\u2019 samples, 23 oncological ones were se -\nlected. Immune response and correlation to type and dose vaccine \nwere analyzed considering oncological treatments. COVIDAR-IgG \ny COVID-19 Spike 1 & 2 IgG where used for immunoglobin assays.\nRESULTS: 23 (10,9%) oncological patient samples were analyzed. \nOne (4,34%) patient has no detectable results. 2 patients (8,69%) \nhad low antibodies values. All the rest, had normal detectable val -\nues. No significant differences were observed according to either \ntype or dose vaccination and medication.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: One of the most important \ncontrol of COVID-19 disease is the detection of antibodies in the \npopulation. It is  possible that idiosyncratic  reactions occur during \nvaccination, specially among risk populations. This is important in \norder to enhance public health system in every community. It is im -\nportant to continue with epidemiological studies in order to obtain \nmore accurate and significant results of these reactions variations.\n210. (417) DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF \nNEW VACCINES EXPRESSING THE RV2626C PROTEIN \nTO PREVENT LATENT MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULO -\nSIS INFECTION.\nMar\u00eda Paula Morelli1,2, Mar\u00eda Paula Del Medico Zajac3, Ni-\ncol\u00e1s Oscar Amiano1,2, Nancy Tateosian1,2, Candela Martin1,2, \nGabriela Calamante3, Ver\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda1,2.\n1 IQUIBICEN, UBA-CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina. 2 \nDepartamento de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica, FCEN, UBA, Buenos \nAires, Argentina. 3IABIMO, INTA-CONICET, Buenos Aires, \nArgentina.\nTuberculosis (TB) has not been eliminated from any country un -\ntil now. Moreover, almost 2 billion persons are latently infected \nwith Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and at risk of disease reacti -\nvation. Thus, new effective vaccines that might prevent TB infection \nare required. Hence, multi-state vaccines including early secretory \nantigens plus latency associated antigens from Mtb were proposed. \nHere, Rv2626c latency antigen was evaluated as a new candidate \nvaccine by combining a recombinant Modified Vaccinia virus Anka -\nra (MVA) expressing the Rv2626c (MVA2626c) with Rv2626c DNA \n(DNA vaccine -pCI). Accordingly, Rv2626c DNA was amplified by \nPCR and ligated into a pCR-TOPO vector. Then, Rv2626c gene was \nsub-cloned into pCI vector for DNA vaccine (pCI-Rv2626c) or into \na transference vector VT (VT-Rv2626c). VT also contains the ex -\npression cassette for the \u03b2-glucuronidasa enzyme and the flanking \nsequences of the MVA086R gene (which codifies for the thymidine \nkinase enzyme). Moreover, VT-Rv2626c was then transfected into \nCEFs previously infected with wtMVA and recombinant viral clones \nwere subsequently isolated. Then, to evaluate the immunogenicity of \nthese preparations, Balb/c mice were immunized with pCI-Rv2626c/\npCI-IL12 (two doses every 14 days). After two weeks, a boost of MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021142\nMVA2626c was administered. Eight days later, splenocytes were \nobtained and in vitro  stimulated with Rv2626c protein. After three \ndays, IFN-\u03b3 production and plasma IgG levels were determined by \nELISA. Our findings showed that pCI-Rv2626c /MVA2626c induced \nspecific IgG and IFN-\u03b3 responses against Rv2626c as compared \nto non-immunized animals. Furthermore, we observed a signifi -\ncantly increase in IFN-\u03b3 (p<0.05) and IgG levels against Rv2626c \n(p<0.001) when pCI-IL12 was used as an adjuvant. Therefore, in the \npresent work, we successfully developed a new tool that might be \nemployed in the control of latent Mtb infection.\n(420) DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD \nTO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF ANTIBODIES \nAGAINST SARS-COV-2 ANTIGENS IN PATIENT SERA \nAND TO ANALYZE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HU -\nMORAL IMMUNE RESPONSE \nSofia Noli Truant1, Daniela M.

The immunological response has \nshown to be extremely complex and the severity of the cases re -\nquires a quick diagnostic. Humoral parameters are especially im -\nportant to analyze the harshness of the disease and to distinguish \nbetween infected and vaccinated patients. However, the human se -\nroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 has shown a vari -\nable response among the population.\nThus, this work aims to design surface plasmon resonance (SPR) \nassays to determine the presence of antibodies anti-SARS-CoV-2 \nand their kinetic characteristics in patient sera. In addition, we eval -\nuated the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in early infection. \nSera were obtained from infected patients from Hospital \u00c1lvarez \nconfirmed by specific PCR and evaluated by commercial tests. \nFor the antibody analysis, assays using full-length r-Spike protein \n(20/20), r-RBD domain (19/20), and r-Nucleoprotein (15/20) immobi -\nlized into a CM5 chip were performed. ELISAs and WBs were used \nto corroborate the results. SPR assays with r-RBD showed that \n10% of the sera from infected patients display a distinct behavior, \nexpressing kinetic association rates two times higher than control \nsamples (104 vs 105 M-1.s -1, p<0.05). Also, when analyzing in vitro its \nability to neutralize the infection capability with a pseudovirus par -\nticle, we found it was eight times higher than control sera (p<0.05). \nAlso, TNF-\u03b1 in positive sera showed higher levels than sera from not \ninfected in half of the patients (p<0.5) analyzed by SPR using a TNF \nreceptor capture on a CM5 chip.\nIn conclusion, we successfully developed an alternative method to \ndetermine the seroprevalence of antibodies against three antigens \nof SARS-COV-2 in real-time. In addition, it allows us to analyze the \nkinetic parameters of the antibodies and the humoral response, \nwhich would correlate with the neutralizing capacity of the sera. \n211. (451) THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF 16\u03b1-BROMOEPI -\nANDROSTERONE AS ADJUVANT FOR THE TREATMENT \nOF TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION\nDenise Anabella Giannone, Mar\u00eda Florencia Quiroga and Ma -\nr\u00eda Bel\u00e9n Vecchione.\nUniversidad de Buenos Aires. CONICET. Instituto de Investi -\ngaciones Biom\u00e9dicas en Retrovirus y Sida (INBIRS). Facul -\ntad de Medicina. Buenos Aires, Argentina.Purpose:  Despite being preventable and curable, tuberculosis (TB) \nis one of the principal causes of death worldwide. Macrophages play \na key role in controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (Mtb) infection. \nIn search of an adjuvant for TB treatment, we aimed to study a syn -\nthetic derivate from DHEA, 16 \ud835\udefc-Br-epiandrosterone (HE2000) as a \nmodulator of bacterial growth and Mtb-induced immune response in \nhuman macrophages.\nMethods : Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) test was per -\nformed by growing Mtb H37Rv in the presence of HE2000. Bacterial \nintracellular growth was evaluated by incubating Mtb infected THP-1 \nmacrophages at different time points in the presence of HE2000. \nAfter 21 days of culture, colony-forming units (CFU) were quantified. \nPhagocytic activity was assessed by treating infected macrophages \nwith HE2000 and stained by the Ziehl Neelsen technique. Nonpara -\nmetric tests were used and a p<0.05 was considered significant.\nResults:  MIC assay showed different concentrations at which \nHE2000 inhibited bacterial proliferation, finding significant differ -\nences with control at 0,5 \u03bcg/ml (p<0.001), 2 \u03bcg/ml (p<0.05) and 16 \n\u03bcg/ml (p<0.01). Also, the concentrations under study were effective \nin enhancing the phagocytic capacity of infected macrophages, \nwhich was evident within 1 hour post-infection (p<0.001). These \nobservations were confirmed by Ziehl Neelsen staining, showing a \nsignificantly higher number of bacteria per cell in HE2000-treated \nmacrophages (p<0,01). Finally, cells exposed to HE2000 showed \nsignificantly enhanced bacterial killing after 4 days of culture com -\npared to untreated cells (p<0.01).\nConclusion : This study suggests that HE2000 enhances the \nphagocytic and microbicidal activities of Mtb infected macrophages. \nTherefore, this compound may be considered as adjuvant therapy \nfor tuberculosis infection.\n212. (474) NATURAL ANTIBODY RESPONSE AGAINST SARS-\nCOV-2 INFECTION IS A MATTER OF TIME AND AGE\nNatalia Saccodossi1,2 Osvaldo Pugliese1, Laura Nicieza1, \nAlejandra Marrazzo1, Silvia A.

Patients\u2019 se -\nrum samples (n=174) were collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and \n10 months after positive qPCR results. Most patients presented \nmild to moderate symptoms and had an age range between 25 and \n80 years. To perform the analysis of the antibody levels we used \nproteins Spike and RBD in a single enzyme-linked immunosorbent \nassay (ELISA) plate (COVIDAR IgG).  Results are expressed as \nmedian (min-max). ANOVA was performed in order to statistical \nevaluation. RESULTS: Antibodies levels increased over time, be -\ning that the highest levels were obtained at 10 months. In patients \nover 55 years old, the antibodies levels were higher than in younger \ngroups (<45 yo) if we consider the total of the samples throughout \nall the months 8.0 (0.9-14.3) vs 4.3 (0.1-15.8); p<0.01. However, if \nwe compare the different age groups at 3 and 6 months after posi -\ntive qPCR results, no significant differences were detected. Further -\nmore, no significant differences concerning gender were observed. \nConcluding remarks, natural infection antibodies levels longlast at \nleast over ten month after positive qPCR and differences between \ndistribution of age were observed. These results contribute to the \nknowledge of the humoral specific antibody response in unvaccinat -\ned patients who had a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 qPCR. \n213. (475) CHRONIC ADMINISTRATION OF THE ANTIDEPRES -\nSANT FLUOXETINE IMPACT ON YERSINIA.

Whether FLX \ntreatment impacts gastrointestinal bacterial infections and their se -\nquelae, such as Reactive arthritis (ReA), remains unknown. We in -\nvestigated the FLX effect on Yersinia enterocolitica  (Ye) O:3 infection \nand ReA in a TNFR1 knockout mouse model. Differences in male \nand female mice were also evaluated. Male and female TNFR1 KO \nmice were orally infected with Ye O:3 (1-5x108 colony-forming units). \nFrom infection day, FLX (20 mg/kg/day) or water (control) was ad -\nministrated in drinking water. On day 5, the number CFU was deter -\nmined in stool, spleen, and mesenteric lymphoid nodes. The weight, \nmobility, mortality, and arthritis score of the mice were recorded. On \nday 21, splenic dendritic cells (DCs) infiltration and their maturation \nmarkers were evaluated by flow cytometry in surviving mice. We \nfound that male TNFR1 KO mice have lower survival and higher \nclinical score after Ye infection. On day 5, FLX treatment increased \nbacterial dissemination in males. Surviving mice developed ReA but \nfemales treated with FLX showed greater severity than controls. \nFurthermore, FLX mice showed a lower proportion of splenic DCs \nwithout changing in CD86 expression. We conclude that TNFR1 \nKO male mice are more susceptible than females to Ye infection. \nThe modulatory effect of FLX hinders more the immune response \nof males increasing systemic bacterial spread. Finally, the chronic \nadministration of FLX did not reduce the severity of ReA and, in con -\ntrast, increased it in females. Although DCs infiltration in the spleen \nwas reduced, the expression CD86 marker did not change, so we \ninfer that the increased arthritis severity could be related to defec -\ntive DCs migration. The results contribute to understanding how \nantidepressant chronic treatment influences the immune responses \nagainst pathogens and the maintenance of immune homeostasis.\n214. (481) STUDY OF GENES REGULATED BY THE GLUCO -\nCORTICOID RECEPTOR IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD AND \nPLEURAL FLUID MONONUCLEAR CELLS FROM PA -\nTIENTS WITH PLEURAL TUBERCULOSIS\nGeorgina Gallucci1, Estefan\u00eda Massa1, Matilde Imhoff1, Betti -\nna Bongiovanni1, Ariana D\u00edaz1, Natalia Santucci1, Diego B\u00e9r -\ntola2, Lioi Susana2, Marisa Derio1, Mar\u00eda Luisa Bay1, Oscar \nBottasso1, Luciano D\u2019 Attilio1.\n1lnstituto de Inmunolog\u00eda Cl\u00ednica y Experimental de Rosario, \nUNR-CONICET, Rosario, Argentina. 2Hospital Provincial del \nCentenario. Rosario, Argentina. \nOne of the commonest extrapulmonary manifestations of tuberculo -\nsis (TB) is pleural TB (PLTB). Since the cellular immune response \n(IR) is essential for the containment and resolution of the infectious \nprocess, PLTB constitutes a model to study the protective IR at the \nsite of infection, and the ensuing endocrine response. In previous \nstudies, we have shown that patients with PLTB have a greater \ninflammatory and cellular response at the pleural compartment \n(increase in IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IFN- \u0263 concentrations) respect to the \nsystemic level. Furthermore, mononuclear cells (MC) from pleural \nexudates (PEMC) had an in vitro  high specific proliferative capaci -\nty compared to peripheral counterparts (PBMC), with cortisol levels \nbeing only increased at the peripheral compartment. To expand this \nissue, PBMC and PEMC from PLTB patients (n=12) were analyzed \nfor the expression levels of genes (RT-qPCR) that are positively \n(ANXA1, GILZ, FKBP5, NFKBIA and NFKBIB) or negatively (IL-1\u03b2, \nIL-6, IFN- \u0263) regulated by glucocorticoid receptor (GR), in addition \nto the NFkB subunit 1 gene (NFkB1) and the eventual relationship \nwith the circulating immuno-endocrine profile. While showing an in -\ncrease in the expression levels of ANXA1, GILZ, NFKBIA in PBMC \nwith respect to PEMC (p<0.02), there were no between-group sta -\ntistical differences in mRNA amounts for FKBP5, NFkB1 and NFK -\nBIB. In parallel, an increase in IL-6, IFN- \u0263 mRNA levels together with \ndecreased IL1\u03b2 transcripts were found in PEMC respect to PBMC \n(p<0.05). It follows that PBMC from patients with PLTB present a \nmarked expression profile of GR-regulated anti-inflammatory genes \nin relation to cells located in the pleural compartment, although \ntranscripts for some proinflammatory cytokines continue to be in -\ncreased. Present results are in line with our former findings about the immuno-endocrine profile seen in the pleural and peripheral \ncompartments as well as the antigen-induced lymphoproliferation.\n215. (490) DYNAMIC OF FOLLICULAR CYTOTOXIC CD8+T \nCELL RESPONSE IN TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI INFECTION\nGazzoni Yamila1, Almada Laura1, Montes Carolina Luc\u00eda1, \nAcosta-Rodriguez Eva Virginia1, Gruppi Adriana1.\n1.Centro de Investigaciones en Bioqu\u00edmica Cl\u00ednica e Inmu -\nnolog\u00eda (CIBICI)-CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas, \nUniversidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, X5000HUA, C\u00f3rdoba, Ar -\ngentina.\nGerminal Centers (GCs) are specialized structures generated with -\nin B cell follicles (FO) in response to T cell-dependent antigens. \nFollicular helper T cells (Tfh) are crucial for GC formation and an -\ntibody-affinity maturation. Other GCs-protagonists are follicular cy -\ntotoxic CD8+T cells (Tfc), who share gene signatures with Tfh cells \nand, in some models, contribute to eliminate infected cells inside \nthe FO.\nOur aim was to study protagonists of GC response in T. cruzi  infec -\ntion and to characterize Tfc cells. C57BL/6 mice were intraperitone -\nally injected with 5.000 trypomastigotes of T. cruzi (Tulahu\u00e9n strain) \nor PBS (control group). Tfc, GC B cells, and plasmablasts (PB) were \nevaluated by FACS and immunofluorescence (IF) staining at differ -\nent days post infection (dpi) in the spleen. \nThe peaks of the Tfc (CD8+CXCR5+PD-1+) and PB (B220low-\nCD138+) response were at 18dpi and decreased at 23 dpi. These \npopulations preceded GC-B cell(B220+FAS+GL-7+) response which \npeaked at 28 dpi. About 80% of Tfc were CD44+CD62-Llow and had a \nhigher expression of Bcl-6, TCF-1, Lag-3, CD40-L and CXCR3 than \nnon-Tfc CD8+T cells (p<0,05). Near 15% of Tfc and 6% of non-Tfc, \nwere specific for the immunodominant T. cruzi  TSKB20 peptide. Af -\nter in vitro  stimulation with PMA/Io or TSKB20, Tfc expressed high \nlevels of CD107a+,IFN-y, TNF-a, Granzyme B and Perforin. By IF \nwe detected CD8+T cells inside of FO at 18 dpi; while at 23dpi and \n28dpi all CD8+ T cells were outside. Additionally, we observed that \nIL-15 and IL-21 increased Tfc survival in vitro .\nTo sum up, we observed an activated, effector and temporal CD8+T \ncell subset whose response was prior to GC, expressed Tfh-related \nmolecules and were in contact with B cells. Co-culture experiments \nare needed to dilucidate the relationship between Tfc and B cell in T. \ncruzi  infection. Tfc could influence antibody response by interacting \nwith PB or GC; or could control the infection since parasite-infected \ncells were observed inside B cell FO.\n216.

Previously, we demon -\nstrated that IFN\u03b3 secretion against Rv2626c, a Mycobacterium \ntuberculosis  (Mtb) dormancy antigen, allows to discriminate LTBI \nsubjects from healthy donors (HD) and tuberculosis (TB) patients. \nIn this work we developed Diagnos-TB, a new IGRA that differenti -\nates TB and LTBI by using a fusion protein (Fp) containing CFP10 \nand ESAT6 Mtb antigens plus Rv2626c protein. CFP10 and ESAT6 \nproteins were cloned, expressed and purified in our laboratory.

In \ncontrast, QFT distinguished Mtb infected individuals (TB patients \nand PPD+ subjects without symptoms) from PPD- individuals with \n73.3% of sensitivity and 60.7% of specificity. Furthermore, by em -\nploying only Fp, we obtained higher concordant results compared to \nQFT (73.3%) and to PPD (59.6%). We next included the Rv2626c \ntube and compared our LTBI diagnosis results with those obtained \nwith QTF for QFT+ healthcare workers (healthy subjects who had \nworked at least two years at Hospital areas where tuberculosis pa -\ntients were confined), detecting 96.6% of LTBI  individuals. Together, \nour findings indicate that Diagnos-TB, an IGRA composed by two \nantigens tubes containing Fp and Rv2626c, allows to diagnose LTBI \nwith high specificity and sensitivity.\n218.

Furthermore, 1.9 billion peo -\nple worldwide are latently infected (LTBI) with Mtb. Identifying and \ntreating LTBI constitutes one of the most important impediments to \ncontrol TB. Moreover, accurate tests to diagnosis LTBI are currently \nunavailable.We have previously demonstrated that circulating IgG \nagainst Rv2626c, an Mtb dormancy antigen, are found in plasma of \nLTBI. Then, here we evaluated particular regions of Rv2626c to be \nused to identify LTBI with higher sensitivity and specificity. For this, \nwe used peptides sequences derived from Rv2626c to sensitize ELI -\nSA plates and then we analyzed the levels of IgG antibodies against \nthose peptides in LTBI, TB patients and healthy donors (HD). The \nstudied regions are overlapping synthetic peptides (13\u201315-mers, \noverlapped by 11amino acids; 36 in total) spanning the sequence \nof Rv2626c. We first examined the levels of circulating IgG against \neach Rv2626c peptide in LTBI.  By doing that, we identified 13 pep -\ntides that allow to detect elevated levels of antibodies in the highest \npercentages of responders. Then, by investigating the specificity of \nthe selected peptides, we could observe that some of them present -\ned a marked higher specificity as compared to HD and TB patients.  \nFor example A) with peptide 18 we observed D.O.LTBI= 0.45 \u00b1 0.15, \nD.O.HD= 0.09 \u00b1 0.02 and D.O.TB= 0.03 \u00b1 0.01 and a percentage of re -\nsponder individuals of 80% in LTBI, 0% in HD, 1% in TB (**p<0.01). \nB) with peptide 19 we observed D.O.LTBI= 0.36 \u00b1 0.18, D.O.HD= 0.004 \n\u00b1 0.001 and D.O.TB= 0.002 \u00b1 0.002 and a percentage of responder \nindividuals of 60% in LTBI, 0% in HD, 1% in TB (*p<0.05). Together, \nour findings demonstrate that an ELISA measuring specific circulat -\ning IgG against Rv2626c peptides would allow to diagnose LTBI with \nhigh specificity and sensitivity.\n219.

Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nBackground and Aims:  Chagas Disease is a potentially life-threat -\nening illness caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi . \nCurrently there is no effective vaccine to prevent or treat the infec -\ntion. Previously, we have developed Traspain, a chimeric trivalent \nimmunogen. To assess new adjuvants that might improve protection \ninduced by vaccination, we evaluated the TLR3, TLR9 and STING \nligands Poly (I:C), CpG oligodeoxynucleotide and Cyclic-di-AMP \n(CDA) respectively by the subcutaneous route.\nMethods: Groups of 6-8 weeks old, female C3H mice (n=6/group) \nwere vaccinated with 3 doses of 10 \u00b5g of Traspain plus 25 \u00b5g of ad -\njuvant or PBS as placebo. Exploratory bleeding was performed and \n20-30 days after the last dose, antigen specific immune responses ABSTRACTS145\nwere evaluated by ELISA, proliferation, and flow cytometry. Addi -\ntionally, for efficacy assessment, immunized mice were challenged \nwith the RA strain of T. cruzi (DTU VI). Parasitemia and weight loss \nwere employed as readouts.\nResults:  Significant Traspain-specific IgG levels were detected in \nsera from CDA and Poly(I:C) groups (IgG titres: 167117*, 60970* \nrespectively, *p<0.01). Interestingly, CDA vaccinated sera exhibited \n3- and 25-times higher titres than Poly(I:C) or CpG (p<0.01).\nIn terms of cell-mediated immunity, proliferation assays showed \na significant difference between Poly(I:C) and CDA vs placebo \n(p<0.05). Production of IL-2, TNF and IFN g was detected on the \nCD4+ T cells subset upon protein recall. More than 60% of these \ncells corresponded to polyfunctional subsets in all groups, having \nCDA the highest level. All formulations were able to reduce weight \nloss and parasitemia, resulting significant only in parasitemia for \nCDA and CpG vaccinated mice (p<0.05).\nConclusions:  Subcutaneous administration of Traspain formulated \nwith Poly(I:C), CpG or CDA is immunogenic and confers partial pro -\ntection against T. cruzi . Traspain/CDA represents the best combina -\ntion in terms of both immunogenicity and anti- T. cruzi  efficacy.\n220.

The Germinal Center-GC-reaction and \nthe extrafollicular-EF-response generate different types of ASC \nwhich provide long and short-term humoral immunity against infec -\ntions, respectively. In our lab, we identified a population of EF-ASC \n(B220intCD138+Blimp-1+Ki-67+, Plasmablasts/PB) with high ex -\npression of PD-L1 and CD39, present in murine infection models \nbut not in autoimmune or immunized mice. The aim of our work is \nto characterize the phenotype and functionality of PB in T cruzi  in-\nfection. Therefore, B6 mice were infected with T. cruzi  and splenic, \nlymph node (LN) and bone marrow (BM) lymphocytes were evalu -\nated at different days post infection (dpi). To assess the antibody \nresponse, sorted splenic PB were incubated for 6h and the levels \nof Igs were evaluated in the culture-supernatant by LEGENDplex. \nIgM, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgA were detected in the PB superna -\ntant and by ELISA we determined the presence of IgM, IgG and IgA \nspecific for T. cruzi  antigens. Moreover, by FACS, we found that the \n99% of splenic PB expressed high levels of PD-L1 and CD39 until \nday 23pi and this frequency was significantly reduced from day 28pi \n(p<0.005). Only the 15% of BM-ASC from mice at chronic phase of \ninfection (130dpi) expressed high levels of PD-L1 and CD39. Inter -\nestingly, we observed that splenic PB expressed higher levels of \nCD80, CD86, MHCII, MHCI, CXCR3, CXCR4, PD-L1 than PB pres -\nent in LN (p<0.005). Otherwise, PB from spleen have lower levels of \ntranscription factor IRF-4, T-bet and Bcl-2, than PB from LN. Like -\nwise, we found higher percentage of Ki-67 negative ASC in LN than \nin spleen at 26 Dpi, suggesting than these ASC could be plasma \ncells. By LEGENDplex, we detected that supernatant of splenic cells \nhad higher levels of IL-6 and lower levels of IL-2 than supernatants \nfrom LN cells. This difference in each tissue-microenvironment could \nbe conditioning the different phenotype of PB. \n221. (606) IMMUNOINFORMATIC ANALYSIS OF A VACCINE \nCANDIDATE AGAINST T.

Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n \nChagas disease, caused by the infection of the protozoan para -\nsite Trypanosoma cruzi , is a tropical neglected disease. To date, \nthere is still no vaccine available against it. In this context, we \nhave developed Traspain, a chimeric antigen containing domains \nof two T. cruzi  relevant antigens: Cruzipain (Cz) and Amastigote \nSurface Protein-2 (ASP-2). Traspain as a vaccine showed prom -\nising results in preclinical models. To broaden the understanding \nof Traspain as an immunological candidate, we have conduct -\ned in silico  studies of its structure and immunological features.  \nTraspain domains and epitopes conservation was evaluated by \nsequence alignment using Blast. Traspain structure was predict -\ned with the novel algorithm RoseTTAFold. Most prevalent HLA al -\nleles in Latin America and rest of the world were selected based \non bibliography and IEDB. Subsequently, human T cell epitopes \nwere predicted using artificial neural networks-based algorithms \n(NetMHCpan and NetMHCIIpan). Linear and discontinuous B cell \nepitopes were predicted using the servers BepiPred and DiscoTope \nrespectively. To confirm antibody recognition, Western blot and \nELISA employing a pool of human chagasic sera were assayed.  \nTraspain domains showed more than 80% of identity compared \nto representatives discrete typing units (DTUs) of T. cruzi . 119 \nnonapeptides were predicted as strong binders (SB) for HLA-I \nmolecules covering the 62 most frequent alleles of world pop -\nulation. 69% of these potential epitopes are located within the \nASP-2 domain. Regarding HLA-II molecules, 99 15-mer peptides \nwere predicted as SB covering 95.8% of most frequent alleles.  \n15 continuous B-cell epitopes were predicted. Con -\nformational B-cell epitopes were also successful -\nly predicted. Antibody recognition was achieved.  \nImmuno-informatic analysis showed that Traspain sequence con -\ntains several potential human CTL, Th and B cell epitopes. Overall, \nthese results support Traspain as a vaccine candidate to be tested \nin a first in human trial.\nINMUNIDAD ANTITUMORAL\n222.

CD39 participates in the generation of adenosine, \nan immunosuppressive molecule that interferes in the anti-tumor re -\nsponse. In this work, we evaluated the role of CD39 on TI-CD8+ T \ncells. C57BL/6 WT and CD39KO mice were injected with 1x106 \nB16F10-OVA tumor cells, 17 days after injection, we evaluated by \nflow cytometry the expression of inhibitor receptors (IRc) (PD-1 and \nTIM-3), transcription factors (TF) related to exhaustion (TOX, TCF-1, \nEOMES, T-bet and IRF-4) and cytotoxic related molecules (gran -\nzime B (GzB), perforin, and CD107) on TI-CD8+ T cells. CD39 KO \nand WT tumor bearing mice exhibited two PD-1 expressing popu -\nlations: a PD-1high and PD-1low; however, CD39KO mice exhibited \na higher % of PD-1low TI-CD8+ T cells than WT(p<0.005). CD39KO \nand WT mice showed a high % of PD-1high cells co-expressed TIM-3 \n(82,4\u00b16,1  and 80,3\u00b117,9 respectively ), an IRc related to terminal MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

PD-1low cells from CD39 and WT mice also exhibit -\ned lower expression of TBET, EOMES, and IRF4 than PD-1high cells \n(p<0.05). Whereas most PD-1low TI-CD8+ T cells from CD39 KO and \nWT were TCF1+ ( 65.4\u00b114.4 and 71.4\u00b111.5 ), a TF related to pre-ex -\nhaustion, PD-1high CD8+ cells were TOX+ and TCF-1- ( 92.8\u00b14.2 and  \n86.4\u00b17.5 ). TI-CD8+ T cells cytotoxicity increase as they become \nmore exhausted, accordingly, a higher % of CD8+ GzB+, perforin+ \nand CD107+ cells were found within PD-1high cells compared to PD-\n1low (p<0.05) TI-CD8+ T cells. Our results suggest that the absence \nof CD39 may favor a pre-exhausted phenotype on TI-CD8+ T cells, \nwhich are known to respond better than terminal exhausted T cells \nto anti-checkpoints, reinforcing the idea that CD39 could be consider \nas a promising target in anti-tumor immunotherapy.\nCD39, CD8+ T Lymphocyte, Tumor, Exhaustion.\n223.

However, the re -\nsponse rate is ~60%. BCG is a local immunomodulatory that induc -\nes a strong inflammatory response that ultimately eliminates the tu -\nmor.We hypothesized that pts with pre-existing Th2 tumor infiltrating \nlymphocytes (TIL) would be more susceptible to BCG-induced Th1 \npolarization and therefore respond better to therapy. \nSearching for a predictive biomarker of BCG response, pre-treat -\nment NMIBC biopsies (n=32) from pts treated with a 6-week induc -\ntion plus at least one 3-week maintenance instillations were evalu -\nated retrospectively by immunohistochemistry. TIL polarization was \nassessed quantifying T-bet+(Th1) and GATA-3+(Th2) lymphocytes \nratio (G/T) and the density and activation of EPX+ eosinophils. \nA Th2score was calculated and correlated to BCG response. In \nnon-responders, Th2score was compared in pre and post-BCG bi -\nopsies. Also, PD-1/PD-L1 expression was analysed. \nResponse rate was 65.6% in the study population. In pre-BCG bi -\nopsies a higher Th2score was significantly associated with BCG \nresponse ( p=0.027, Mann Whitney test) and to prolonged recur -\nrence-free survival ( p=0.0138, Wilcoxon rank test). A ROC curve \nallowed discrimination of responders with 91% sensibility and \n57.1% specificity (Th2score cut-off >48.1; AUC 0.74 (95% CI 0.56-\n0.91; p=0.028). Interestingly, in post-BCG biopsies TIL increased \ntheir Th2-polarization, probably reflecting BCG failure to induce a \npro-inflammatory status and thus lack of antitumor response. PD-\nL1 expression (tumor cells/TIL) and PD-1 expression (TIL) was not \nassociated to BCG response.\nThe results support our hypothesis that pre-existing Th2-polarized \nTIL can predict a better response to BCG immunotherapy. Instead, \npts that already have Th1-polarized TIL would not respond to BCG, \npresumably because the tumor has already developed immune es -\ncape mechanisms. \n224.

Adaptive NK cell subsets are characterized by a lack of \nFc\u0190RI\u03b3 expression and/or high expression of NKG2C.\nObjective:  To identify adaptive NK cell subpopulations in BC pa -\ntients and characterize subsets that support robust ex vivo  anti-BC \nactivity via trastuzumab (TRZ)- mediated ADCC.\nWith this aim, we analyzed the immunophenotype of NK cells in pe -\nripheral blood samples from our cohort of 60 BC patients and 32 \nhealthy donors (HD), both 85% seropositive for human cytomega -\nlovirus. Defining adaptive (NKa) and conventional NK (NKc) cells \nas FcR\u03b3- and FcR\u03b3+, respectively, NKa subpopulation was detect -\ned in 66% of BC patients and 75% of HD. We characterized dif -\nferential expression of NK-cell inhibitory and activating receptors. \nNKa cells expressed significantly higher levels of NKG2C (<0,0001) \nand CD85j (<0,0001), and lower levels of NKp30 (<0,0001), CD161 \n(<0,0001) and CD16 (p<001) compared to NKc cells (paired t-tests), \nwhich is consistent with previous observations in HD. \nWe then, compared the production of IFN\u03b3 by NKc and NKa cells. \nWhen PBMC were cultured with SKBR3 HER-2+ cells treated with \nTRZ, NKa cells from BC patients and HD exhibited increased IFN\u03b3 \nproduction compared to NKc cells (p<0.01, paired t-test).\nConclusions: NKa cells have different immunophenotypic character -\nistics than NKc cells in BC. Ex vivo treatment of PBMC with TRZ re -\nveals superior effector functions of NKa cells. Our results encourage \nstudying NKa cells as a potential candidate for predicting Ab-based \ntherapy outcomes in HER2+ BC.\n225.

During my scientific career, I focused on glycans and \nglycan-binding proteins as key players in neovascularization and im -\nmune responses in cancer, inflammation, and immunity.\nSince 2016, I became the head of the \u201cGlycobiology and Vascular \nBiology\u201d laboratory at the IHEM-CONICET, were we explore several \nphysio-pathological settings converging on the cellular and molecu -\nlar mechanisms that link hypoxia, neovascularization, and immune \nresponses. In this sense, we are particularly interested in generating \nrelevant systems to study in vitro hypoxic-mediated neovascular -\nization and to generate novel molecular diagnostic tools for clinical \napplications.\nOur main areas of research include: 1) The glycome remodeling \nin virally mediated tumorigenesis in the context of KSHV and HIV \nco-infection in Kaposi Sarcoma. 2) The effect of hypoxia in inflam -\nmation-induced angiogenesis, and the dynamic regulation of intes -\ntinal glycome in inflammatory diseases. In this scenario, we also \nstudy miRNA expression as mediators of hypoxia-driven epithelial \ncell glycosylation. \nFinally, in an attempt to reconcile seemingly opposite evidence con-\ncerning the impact of hypoxia on functional features of exhausted \nCD8 T cells, we investigate the fine-tuning of CD8 T cell exhaus -\ntion by hypoxia and its association with angiogenesis in the tumor \nmicroenvironment. In this sense, we found that both hypoxia and \nVEGF promote the differentiation of PD-1+TIM-3+CXCR5+ termi -\nnally exhausted CD8 T cells at the expense of PD-1+TIM-3- progen -\nitor subsets. Moreover, hypoxia accentuated a proangiogenic profile ABSTRACTS147\nin exhausted CD8 T cells, MDSCs, and hMSCs cells. Altogether, \nour findings highlight the reciprocal regulation between hypoxia, \nangiogenesis, and immunosuppression, providing a rational basis \nto optimize synergistic combinations of antiangiogenic and immu -\nnotherapeutic \n226.

However, the \nefficacy of CpG-ODN as a prophylactic agent in reducing meta -\nstatic dissemination has been less frequently studied. Recently, it \nwas demonstrated that a single systemic prophylactic injection of \nclass-C CpG-ODN, administered 24 h before tumor cell injection into \nthe cerebral circulation, was sufficient to reduce brain tumor growth \n(Benbenishty, A. et al., 2019). \nIn this work, we aimed to study the effect of prophylactic class-B \nCpG-ODN administration in B16 melanoma tumor growth. CpG-\nODN (50ug/ml) was s.c. administered on days -8, -6,-4 and -2 be -\nfore s.c inoculation of 5 x 105 B16 melanoma cells and then, tumor \ngrowth was measured every other day. Pre-treatment with CpG-\nODN enhanced tumor growth and reduced mice survival in two \nseparate experiments (n=6, per group; p\u22640.05 ). As a control, thera -\npeutic intratumoral inoculation of CpG-ODN reduced tumor size and \nprolonged survival, as expected.\nFlow cytometry analysis of immune populations in spleen and lymph \nnodes performed after  4 injections of CpG-ODN and 24 h before \ntumor cell inoculation showed in spleen a significant decrease in the \npercentage of T cells (CD45+ CD3+, p=0.0016), whereas dendritic \ncells (CD45+ CD3- CD19- Ly6G- Ly6C- CD11c+) show non-signifi -\ncant changes. In contrast, the frequency of B cells (CD45+ CD19+, \np=0,0035) and neutrophils (CD45+ CD3- CD19- Ly6G+ CD11b+, \np=0.0019) increases suggesting a possible tumor promoting role for \nthese populations.  When tumor infiltrating lymphocyte where stud -\nied at day 15 post inoculation, an important reshaping of the tumor \ninfiltrate was observed. Further studies should be done to decipher \nthe immune mechanisms underlying the tumor promoting role of \nCpG-ODN in this model. \n227.

Several evidences suggest \nthat CPF- and GLY-based pesticides are genotoxic and their use \nhas been linked to the increased frequency of malignancies ob -\nserved in highly fumigated rural areas. However, their effect on the \nimmune system, including cells involved in immunosurveillance of \ntumor cells, has been poorly explored. Here, we investigated the ef -\nfects of two commercial formulations containing CPF (Clorpi48) and \nGLY (Roundup Plus) as well as their isolated active principles on the phenotype and function of human NK cells. First, we identified \nsub-apoptotic doses of these substances by flow cytometry perform -\ning a dose-response curve with human peripheral blood mononu -\nclear cells (PMBC). Next, using such sub-apoptotic doses, we an -\nalyzed the phenotype of pesticide-treated NK cells. We observed a \npesticide dose-dependent reduction in the expression of CD16 and \nCD62L on NK cells after a 24 h of culture with CPF, GLY, Roundup \nand Clorpi48. Moreover, a diminished frequency of IFN- g-producing \nNK cells was observed upon exposure of cytokine-stimulated NK \ncells to 5 mM GLY, 0.05 mM Roundup, 0.01 mM Clorpi48 but not \nto 0.02 mM CPF ( p<0.05). Moreover, NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity \nagainst K562 cells was also affected by pesticide treatment. After \n0.05 mM Roundup and 0.01 mM Clorpi48 treatment, cytotoxicity \nwas reduced by 27% ( p<0.01) and 29% ( p<0.001), respectively. \nIn accordance with previous scientific evidence, final formulations \nof pesticides (which include additional compounds such as polye -\nthoxylated alkylamines surfactants that facilitate their absorption by \ncells and tissues) showed a more potent effect on phenotype and \nfunction of NK cells than the isolated compounds. Therefore, we \nconclude that GLY- and CPF-based pesticides affect NK phenotype \nand function, which might impact on their ability to detect and elimi -\nnate nascent tumor cells.\n228.

Patients receive trastuzumab \n(Tz), but 27-42% of them do not respond. We demonstrated that the \noverexpression of TNF\u0251 induces Tz resistance in cells and tumors \nby upregulating the membrane glycoprotein MUC4, which hides Tz \nepitope on HER2 impairing its binding and pharmacological effects. \nBlocking the soluble TNF\u0251 isoform with INB03 (DN) reduces MUC4 \nexpression, overcomes Tz resistance and unleashes an antitumor \ninnate immune response (IIR) with a decrease in myeloid-derived \nsuppressor cells, an increase in NK cell-activation and degranula -\ntion and a macrophage (M\u03c6) polarization to the M1 subtype.\nWe studied M\u03c6 and NK cells contribution to the Tz-mediated an -\ntitumor IIR and MUC4 impact in human T-lymphocyte recruitment \nand differentiation. We genetically modified the Tz-resistant HER2+ \nBC cell lines JIMT-1 and KPL-4 to express a doxycycline-inducible \n(Dox) MUC4 shRNA (shMUC4) or a control one (shControl) and in -\njected them into female nude mice, which were treated with IgG or \nTz (5 mg/kg), DN (10 mg/kg) or the combination of Tz+DN, with \n(+Dox) or without (-Dox) shRNA induction.\nAfter M\u03c6 depletion with chlodronate or NK cell depletion with an -\nti-asialo GM1, in -Dox tumors we found that both populations are \nneeded to achieve Tz+DN antitumor effect (p<0.01 and p<0.05, res -\npectively). However, upon MUC4 silencing, only M\u03c6 are required to \nmediate Tz antitumor effect (p<0.01). Secretome from JIMT-1 and \nKPL-4 cells with MUC4 silencing promoted differentiation of activa -\nted T-cells to effector cells. Finally, in our HER2+ BC patient cohort, \nwe found a negative correlation between tumor infiltrating lympho -\ncytes presence and MUC4 expression (p=0,005).\nWe conclude that M\u03c6 are key players in the Tz-mediated antitumor \nIIR and that MUC4 promotes cold HER2+ tumors with poor therapy \nresponse. Women with HER2+MUC4+ BC could benefit from the \ncombined treatment of Tz+DN.\n229.

PD-1 activation \nby PD-L1  leads to CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte exhaustion, which is at \nthe focal  point of today\u2019s cancer immune therapies. However, little \nis known  about which other immunosuppression mechanisms are \ntriggered by tumor-intrinsic PD-L1 expression.\nTo genetically address tumor-immune system interactions in a triple \nnegative  breast cancer (TNBC) model, we developed a CRISPR/\nCas9 expressing TNBC-like  EO771 cell line platform. Using flow cy -\ntometry, we characterized the  immune response associated with the \nprogression of EO771 tumors, which resembled immunosuppres -\nsion signatures associated with poor prognosis in TNBC patients: \nan increase in pro-tumoral M2 macrophage polarization, a decrease \nin MHCII+ Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs) and a marked increase \nof T-cell exhaustion.\nTo test the role  of tumoral PD-L1 in tumor-mediated immune escape, \nwe generated PD-L1  KO EO771 cell lines. Using CRISPR/Cas9 ed -\nited EO771 lines KO  for PD-L1, we found that tumor intrinsic PD-L1 \nexpression is  required for tumor growth. Interestingly, we also found \nthat PD-L1  expressed by the tumor cell exerts a general impact over  \nthe tumoral immune infiltrate composition: a) it is required for  the \ndifferentiation of M2 macrophages and for the enrichment of myeloid  \nderived suppressor cells and b) in the T-cell compartment, unex -\npectedly, tumoral PD-L1 is needed to exhaustion of effector CD4+ \nbut not cytotoxic CD8+  cells.\nAll together, these data suggests that tumor-intrinsic PD-L1 plays a  \nkey role on TNBC tumor growth by triggering different immunosup -\npressive mechanisms  in the tumor immune landscape. Using this \neditable EO771 model platform,  we will be able to massively test \ntumoral PD-L1 synthetic  interactions to identify candidate genetic \ntargets to overcome PD-1/PD-L1 resistance  in TNBC.\n230.

However, the role of \nB cells is not completely elucidated. In this work, we evaluate tu -\nmor-infiltrating (TI) lymphocytes in two different murine melanoma \nmodels focalizing the study in the B cell population. C57BL/6 mice \nwere injected subcutaneously (sc) or intraperitoneally (ip) with 4x105 \nB16F10-OVA tumor cells and on day 14, tumors and spleen were \ncollected. By Flow cytometry, we observed, that compared to mice \ninjected sc, ip-injected mice show higher frequency of TI-CD45+ \ncells (p=0.03) but no differences in the % of TI-CD8+ T cells or CD8+ \nexhausted T cells (TIM-3+PD-1+). While there are no differences in \nTregs frequency, TI-CD4+ conventional T cells are more frequent \nin ip-injected mice (p=0,01), moreover the % of TI-CD19+ cells is \nsignificantly increased in these mice compared to sc-injected mice \n(p\u22640.0001). Surprisingly, in tumor microenvironment of the ip-inject -\ned mice, we detected a high % of B cells (43.4\u00b16.0) exhibiting na\u00efve phenotype and a significant frequency of plasmablast (19.8\u00b18.8).  A \nhigh frequency of plasmablast express the activation marker CD69 \n(89.2 \u00b13.5) and the ecto-enzyme CD39 (60.2 \u00b123.1). The B cell \ncompartment is different in the spleen from ip-injected mice. Indeed, \nwhile the % of na\u00efve B cells is similar (42.4\u00b14.9), the frequency of \nthe plasmablast is significantly lower (4.2\u00b11.0). Additionally, we ob -\nserved that the frequency of CD69-expressing plasmablast reach a \nvalue of 19.6\u00b19.8 while the % of CD39high-expressing plasmablast \nis only 8.4\u00b12.0.\nTaken together these results demonstrated that ip- tumor injected \nmice represent an excellent model for the study of TI- B cell com -\npartment. Future studies will be perform to understand the role of \nthe TI-plasmablast expressing an activation marker and CD39 in the \nimmune response against tumors.\n231. (447) CHARACTERIZATION OF TUMOR INFILTRAT -\nING NK CELLS (TINK) AND TYPE 1 INNATE LYMPHOID \nCELLS (ILC1) IN BREAST CANCER\nMar\u00eda Cecilia Santilli, Mar\u00eda Victoria Regge, Mariana Gantov, \nAdri\u00e1n Friedrich, Jessica Mariel Sierra, Florencia Secchiari, \nAldana Trotta, Natalia Rubinsztain, Bel\u00e9n Candela Lozada \nMontanari, Mercedes Beatriz Fuertes, Norberto Walter Zwir -\nner, Carolina In\u00e9s Domaica,\nInstituto de Biolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental-CONICET, \nCABA, Argentina.\nILC1 and NK cells share several phenotypic and functional char -\nacteristics and display plasticity because they can interconvert one \ninto another in a context-dependent manner. Indeed, TGF-\u03b2-driven \nconversion of TINK into intermediate populations of ILC1 (intILC1) \nand ILC1 has been proposed as a tumor immune escape mecha -\nnism. However, the role of ILC1 in antitumor immunity remains ill-ex -\nplored. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate TINK and ILC1 \nin the tumor microenvironment (TME) using the 4T1 triple-negative \nbreast cancer mouse model. BALB/c mice were injected with 3x104 \n4T1 cells and after 19 days, mice were euthanized and cell sus -\npensions of tumor, draining lymph nodes, spleen, lungs, and liver \nwere obtained to study NK cells, intILC1 and ILC1 by flow cytom -\netry. Tissues from healthy mice were also obtained. ILC1 and in -\ntILC1 were present in tumor and lung, but were absent in spleen and \nlymph nodes, while only ILC1 were found in liver from both groups \nof mice. A higher frequency of intILC1 than of ILC1 (p<0.01) was \nobserved in the TME. In lung, where 4T1 metastasizes, higher fre -\nquencies of ILC1 were observed in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice than in \nhealthy animals (p<0.05). Like TINK, both cell types expressed the \nactivating receptor NKG2D in the TME, while 4T1 cells expresses \nNKG2D ligands. NKG2D expression was higher in ILC1 and intILC1 \npresent in the TME than in liver (p<0.05) and lungs (p<0.05) either \nfrom tumor-bearing or healthy mice. Also, intILC1 and ILC1 from tu -\nmor-bearing mice or from healthy mice expressed CD69, supporting \ntheir sentinel-like tissue resident characteristics. Moreover, within \nthe TME, ILC1 exhibited higher expression of Ly6C (associated with \nILC1 activation) than in the liver of tumor-bearing mice (p<0.01) and \nsuch expression was higher in ILC1 than in intILC1 (p<0.05) and \nTINK (p<0.01). We conclude that the TME contains ILC1 that display \nan activated phenotype, which suggests that they might be involved \nin tumor immunoediting.\n232.

CD39 is an unequivocal marker CD8+ of exhaustion. Tu -\nmor infiltrating (TI) CD39+Tconv cells represent an heterogeneous \npopulation with features of exhaustion. Transcriptional profiling of ABSTRACTS149\nTI-CD39+Tconv cells showed that they exhibit a transcriptional sig -\nnature associated with cytotoxic CD4+ T cells. In this work, we aim \nto evaluate the impact of Anti-CTLA-4 treatment on TI-CD39+Tconv \ncells. C57BL7/6 mice were injected with 0.5x106 MC38 tumor cells. \nOn days, 4, 7 and 10 mice were treated with anti-CTLA-4 (100ug/\nmice) or IgG (Control). On day 17 we evaluated by flow cytometry \nthe phenotype of the TI-CD39+Tconv cells. As expected, anti\u2013CTLA-\n4 treated mice exhibited reduced tumor volume and frequency of \nTI-Tregs respect to controls (p<0.001), however they showed high -\ner frequency of TI-CD39+Tconv cells (p<0.01). UMAP visualization \nanalysis based on the expression levels of 8 molecules on TI-Tconv \ncells from treated and control mice shown 10 different clusters. Af -\nter treatment, clusters corresponding to FOXP3+ (Tregs) cells are \nalmost missing; however, 2 clusters corresponding to CD39+ and \ninhibitor receptors (PD-1, 2B4, TIGIT, LAG-3) expressing cells are \nenriched. Interestingly one of these enriched clusters, exhibit high -\ner expression of CD39 and PD-1. The evaluation of transcription \nfactors related to exhaustion (TOX, Eomes, Helios) or pre-exhaus -\ntion (TCF-1) as well as CD107a (a marker of cytolytic capability) \nrevealed no differences in the expression of all these markers on \nTI-CD39+Tconv cells from treated or control mice. All together, we \nconclude that the anti-CTLA-4 treatment expand the TI-CD39+T -\nconv cells, and has no significant impact in the phenotype or func -\ntion of this population. Due to the cytotoxic potential TI-CD39+Tconv \ncells may contribute to the immune response against tumors.   \n233.

This protein in known as an \nimportant regulator of actin cytoskeleton remodeling. LSP1 polymor -\nphisms or downregulation are considered risk factors for some types \nof cancer.\nWe previously shown that B16-OVA melanoma in Lsp1-/- mice grows \nsignificantly faster and bigger than in wild type (WT) controls. Also, \ntumors harvested from Lsp1-/- mice show a lower frequency of total \ninfiltrating leukocytes compared to WT mice. Furthermore, there is \na reduced extravasation efficiency of  Lsp1-/- leukocytes into tumor, \ncombined with a defective CD8+ T cell priming in Lsp1-/- tumor dLN. \nWe continued this study by comparing the cytokine milieu in melano -\nma tumors in Lsp1-/- vs WT mice. For that, 1.105 B16-OVA melanoma \ncells were implanted in both animal groups and on day 16 tumors \nwere harvested. Aproximately 70 mg tumor/mouse was digested \nusing T-PER\u2122 Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent added with prote -\nase inhibitor. Tumor-cytokine content was determined by a multiplex \ncommercial assay using fluorescence\u2013encoded beads that allows \nsimultaneous quantification of 13 mouse cytokines including IL-1\u03b1, \nIL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IL-23, IL-27, MCP-1, IFN-\u03b2, \nIFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and GM-CSF. We found that tumors in Lsp1-/- mice \nhave significantly higher levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-27, IL-17A and IL-\n23 (p<0.01) as well as higher levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-12p70, IFN-\u03b2 and \nGM-CSF (p<0.001) than WT mice. However, tumor extracts con -\ntained similar levels of IL-1\u03b1, INF-\u03b3, MCP-1 and IL-6. Sumarizing, \nthe tumoral milieu in Lsp1-/- mice has increased levels of cytokines \nthat can act as angiogenesis promoters, favoring tumoral growth \nand chronic inflammation, as well as cytokines involved in promot -\ning DC activation.\n234.

Despite the advances in surgery and \nothers treatments, the survival of GBM patients has not improved \nsignificantly in the past three decades. Thymic stromal lymphopoi -\netin (TSLP) is a cytokine produced primarily by activated epithelial \ncells and it has been shown to be a key factor in maintaining immune \nhomeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses at mucosal \nbarriers. Furthermore, recent studies have found the participation of \nTSLP in inflammatory diseases and cancer. This work aimed to elu -\ncidate the relevance of TSLP in the interaction between neutrophils \nand GBM cells. For this purpose, human U251 cell line or tumoral \ncells obtained from a patient\u2019s GBM biopsy (GBM-b) were co-cul -\ntured with human neutrophils.\nFirst, we observed a decrease in the neutrophils apoptosis when \nthey were cocultured with the U251 cell line or the GBM-b cells in \nthe presence of exogenous TSLP (p<0.05). Importantly, neutrophils \nfrom healthy donors and GBM patients expressed TSLP receptor \nafter 24hs of culture (p<0.05). Then, we evaluated the expression \nof endogenous TSLP in the cocultures. By RT-qPCR, we observed \nthat the U251 cell line or the GBM-b cells produced TSLP when \nincubated with Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF). On the other hand, \nneutrophils expressed very low to undetectable amounts of TSLP, \ncompared to the tumor cells. Furthermore, neutrophil expression of \nTSLP was not induced either by coculture with GBM-b cells nor by \nstimulation with EGF.\nFinally, neutrophils from healthy donors and GBM patients in -\ncreased the IL-8 production in presence of TSLP (p<0.05). Notably, \nneutrophils also produced IL-8 in the presence of U251 cell line or \nGBM-b cells.\nOur findings suggest that TSLP is present in GBM cells and could \nmodulate the inflammatory microenvironment through their cross-\ntalk with neutrophils.\n235.

In addition, B16 and EL4 ex -\nhibited divergent tumor growth in hosts deficient in IL-17 signaling. \nThese data led us to hypothesize that IL-17 may trigger different \ntranscriptional programs in both cell lines to promote or restrain tu -\nmor progression. To evaluate this, we performed RNA-seq to com -\npare the transcriptomes and differentially expressed genes (DEG) \nin B16 and EL4 cells after exposure to IL-17 for 24h. We confirmed \nthe different IL-17R expression profiles in both cell lines that were \nlinked to significant differences in the expression of genes of the \nIL-17 pathway in the basal condition. Exposure to IL-17 led to dif -\nferent outcomes among the cell lines. Comparison of medium vs \nIL-17 treated cells revealed 374 DEG (179 up and 195 down) in \nB16 cells, and 535 DEGs (444 up and 96 down) in EL4 cells with \nonly 12 genes in common (6up, 5down and 1 with opposite result)\n(p<0.05, logFC>1.5). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis highlighted with -\nin the Top Canonical Pathways enriched in IL-17-treated B16 cells \npathways associated to cytokine-mediated responses while within \nthose enriched in IL-17-treated EL4 cells predominated pathways \nassociated to signaling during cellular processes such as cell growth \nand cell-to-cell interactions. Our results highlight that IL-17-signaling \ntriggered diverse responses in different tumor cells that may mod -ulate tumor growth likely as consequence of particular profiles of \nIL-17R subunit expression.\n237. (551) ANALYSIS OF THE BINDING CAPACITY OF \u03b12-DO -\nMAIN OF MICA TO NKG2D RECEPTOR\nJose A. Rodriguez-Siza1, Karen Toledo-Stuardo2, Samantha \nTello2 & Mar\u00eda C. Molina2\n1Biochemical Engineering School, Engineering Faculty, Pon -\ntifical Catholic University of Valparaiso;2Immunology Pro -\ngram, Institute of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine, \nUniversity of Chile\nTo the date, the role of each MICA domains (\u03b11 or \u03b12) in the binding \nwith NKG2D is not well understood and in this work we presented \nthe subcloning, production and purification of \u03b12 domain of MICA, \nand the behavior with NKG2Dr.  \nMethodology . The subcloning of a2 MICA domain was done with a \npET-JT1 vector, which was introduced into E.coli  D5H\u03b1 by chemical \ncompetency. Through a clonal selection, we obtained the DNA and \nthen sequenced the insert with external primers. Second, we intro -\nduced the vector with the \u03b12 MICA domain sequence, into E.coli  \nBL21 and produced the recombinant protein by fermentation and \nposterior induction with IPTG. The purification of protein was done \nseparating the medium and cells, and then, lysing the cells, and pu -\nrifying the proteins through Ni+ chromatographic column. Last, we \nprove the binding functionality of recombinant protein by immuno \nassay, using a homodimer NKG2D recombinant and we compared \nits behavior with a construction of recombinant MICA external do -\nmain (MICAsp). \nResults:  After the subcloning, the sequence had a high identity with \nthe original gene. The protein structure model was obtained using \nthe Swiss-Model server. The chromatogram showed a high pres -\nence of protein in the supernatant of lysis, but only a low percentage \nof binding protein. Thanks to design of protein with a polyhistidine \n(His)-tag, this should be retained by the column, and be into the elu -\ntion fraction. The \u03b12 domain was bond to the NKG2D recombinant \nprotein, in different concentration, at the same way like MICAsp re -\ncombinant protein. MICAsp showed an optical density signal higher \nthan \u03b12 domain, however this signal is half to obtained with MICAsp, \nindicated that this domain provide, at less, the half of capacity of \nbinding. \nConclusions: This work showed the possibility of production and \npurification of \u03b12 MICA domain, and its functionality in the binding \nto NKG2D, allowing to know the importance of the \u03b12 domain in the \nunion with the receptor.\n238.

We have recently demonstrat -\ned that Galectin 1 (Gal1), a b-galactoside-binding protein, enhanc -\nes both the immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic activities of \nMDSC-derived exosomes. Here, we aimed to described Gal1 role \nin MDSC exosomes biology. We have differentiated MDSC from \nmouse bone marrow cells in vitro , incubated them with recombinant \nGal1 (MDSC-Gal1), and isolated the exosomes shed (control MD -\nSC-exo or MDSC-Gal1-exo). We have characterized MDSC-exo \nand their parental cell population by flow cytometry. Interestingly, \nCD63, a well-established marker of tumoral exosomes, was not de -\ntected on MDSC-exo surface. In contrast, we have detected high \nexpression of MHC II on MDSC-exo surface. Notably, Gal1 induced ABSTRACTS151\nheightened PD-L1 and IDO expression on MDSC-exo (p <0.05 \nand p <0.01, respectively). However, other immune checkpoints \nexpression as LAG 3 and VISTA was not detected on MDSC-exo \nsurface. By using an in-house-developed array of conjugated plant \nlectins we have evaluated the glycosylation signature of MDSC-exo \nby flow cytometry and found higher exposure of asialo-core-1-gly -\ncans, a preferred ligand of Gal1, on MDSC-Gal1-exo compared to \ncontrol MDSC-exo. Accordingly, the binding of both Gal1 and Gal2 \nto MDSC-Gal1-exo was higher (p <0.05). To further elucidate Gal1 \ncontribution to MDSC-exo immunosuppression capacity, we have \nco-cultured mouse activated T cells with MDSC-Gal1-exo or control \nMDSC-exo. Notably, MDSC-Gal1-exo further inhibited T cell prolif -\neration and activation compared to control MDSC-exo in a dose-de -\npendent manner (p <0.001). In conclusion, we have described \nfor the first time Gal1 effect on the  immunosuppressive capacity \nof MDSC exosomes.\n239.

This tumor is defined by the \nhallmark features of uncontrolled cellular proliferation, diffuse infil -\ntration, robust angiogenesis, resistance to apoptosis and genomic \ninstability. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter, which can also \nmodulates cell survival, proliferation and differentiation in neuronal \nand non-neuronal cells such as immune cells, which has been re -\nferred to as a \u201cnon-neuronal cholinergic system\u201d. The aim of this \nwork was to elucidate the relevance of the non-neuronal cholinergic \nsystem in the tumor of glioblastoma and in the interaction between \nimmune and GBM cells.\nHuman U251 and U373 GBM line cells showed the expression of \nthe coactivation marker ligand OX40 ligand (OX40L) and apoptosis \nhas assessed by flow cytometry, both lines have basal expression \nof OX40L and it was not modulated by cholinergic system; but the \napoptosis was increased (p<0.05) when the cells were cultivated \nwith cholinergic agonist. On the other hand, in order to evaluate \nwhether the cholinergic system modulate the cross-talk with im -\nmune cells, human dendritic cells (DC) were differentiation mono -\ncyte CD14+ isolated by positive selection from peripheral blood of \nhealthy adult volunteer and patients with GBM and then were cul -\ntured with GM-CSF and IL-4 during 5 day. It was observed an in -\ncrease in the % of + cells of OX40L and HLA-DR when the DC of \npatients with GBM are treated with cholinergic agonist. Conversely, \nmacrophages M2 were co-cultures with GBM line and incubated in \nthe presence of cholinergic agonist and we observed a decreased in \nthe expression HLADR. Conclusions: our findings suggest that the \nnon-neuronal cholinergic system is present in GBM cells and could \nmodulate their cross-talk with the immune system.\nINMUNIDAD INNATA\n240.

Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nThe hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) associated with diarrhea, \na consequence of Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli in-\nfection, is a common cause of pediatric acute and chronic renal \nfailure. Stx type 1 and type 2 (Stx1 and Stx2) produced by those \nbacteria are the main factors related with HUS that trigger kidney \ndamage. Stx2-producing strains are associated with severe cases \nof HUS in Argentina. gd T cells are a specialized subset of T lym -\nphocytes, which act as early sensors of cellular stress and infection. \nThey can exert cytotoxicity against infected and transformed cells \nand produce cytokines and chemokines. In this work, we studied \nthe activation of human peripheral gd T cells in response to human \nglomerular endothelial cells (HGEC) exposed to Stx2 (0.01 ng/ml, \n24 h) or their conditioned medium. We analyzed CD69, CD107a, \nand perforin expression by flow cytometry; and cytokine production \nby ELISA and intracellular staining in gd T cells after incubation with \nStx2-treated HGEC or their conditioned medium. We evaluated by \nconfocal microscopy, the interaction between gd T cells and HGEC \ntreated or not with Stx2 and perforin distribution. As result, we ob -\nserved an increase in TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and cell interactions ( p<0.05) \nin gd T cells cultured with Stx2-treated HGEC, and perforin polariza -\ntion; but without changes in CD69. Moreover, gd T cells incubated \nwith Stx2-treated HGEC conditioned medium showed an increase \nin TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 production, and CD107a expression and a de -\ncrease in intracellular perforin ( p<0.05). Interestingly, the blockage \nof TNF- a by Etanercept reverted the increase in TNF- a, IFN- g, and \nCD107a, and the decrease in perforin ( p<0.05) in gd T cells incubat -\ned with Stx2-treated HGEC conditioned medium. Our results indi -\ncate that soluble factors released by Stx2-stimulated HGEC modu -\nlate the activation of gd T cells, being TNF- a a key player during this \nprocess. This suggest that gd T cells could be involved in the renal \nendothelial damage in SUH.\n241.

The \nnasal priming with Dp04 reduced pneumococcal counts in lung and \nblood and diminished the levels of lung injury biomarkers. In this \nwork, we aimed to characterize the role of alveolar macrophages \n(AM) on the immunomodulatory properties of Dp04 in the context of \npneumococcal infection. In the first set of experiments, mice were MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Variations in \nnumbers and functionality of resident AM in broncho-alveolar lavage \n(BAL) samples were evaluated. The number of activated CD11c+Si-\nglecF+MHC-IIhi AM was significantly increased after Sp challenge in \nmice primed with Dp04 than in controls (p<0.05). Furthermore, AM \nobtained from Dp04-treated mice produced  in vitro  higher levels of \nIFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, as well as IL-10 and IL-27 compared to the control \ngroup (p<0.05). In a second set of experiments, AM were depleted \nusing liposomes containing clodronate (CLP) before the stimulation \nof with Dp04. The CLP treatment significantly affected the ability of \nDp04 to reduce pneumococcal cell counts, as well as lung injury \nbiomarkers. In addition, AM depletion impaired the capacity of Dp04 \nto differentially modulate the cytokine profile in the respiratory tract. \nThe ability of Dp04 to increase the levels of BAL IFN-\u03b3, IL-10 and \nIL-27 in response to Sp infection was abolished when AM were de -\npleted by CLP (p<0.05). This results show for the first time that AM \nhave a relevant role in the immunomodulatory effect of Dp04. Our \nresults also mark a significant advance in the positioning of Dp04 as \na next-generation probiotic for the respiratory tract.\nKey words: Alveolar macrophages, clodronate liposomes, respirato -\nry commensal bacteria, innate respiratory immunity.\n242.

GBM is refractory to standard treat -\nments such as gross total resection, followed by radiotherapy and \nchemotherapy because of its infiltration nature. Therefore, current \ntherapies are only a temporary and limited solution. However, there \nare new immunotherapy approaches to GBM and one of them in -\nvolves the adoptive transfer of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. This subset of T lympho -\ncytes expresses a restricted repertoire and can recognize stressed \nand malignant cells, and induce their apoptosis. Within the periph -\neral blood \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, those that express TCRV\u03b39V\u03b42 chains consti -\ntute the main subsets of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in a healthy human. We recently \ndemonstrated that soluble factors released by GBM cells activate \n\u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes by inducing a Th1-like profile. Moreover, it is well \nknown that tumor cells can secrete extracellular vesicles, among \nthem, microvesicles (MV), which contain molecules that regulate \ntumor microenvironment to allow their growth and progression. For \nthose reasons, in this work we aimed to evaluate whether MV, as re -\nleased factors derived from human GBM cells, were involved in the \nmodulation of \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes\u2019 functionality. For this purpose, \u03b3\u03b4 T \ncells were purified from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, \nby using an anti-TCR \u03b3\u03b4 MicroBead isolation kit. After purification, \n\u03b3\u03b4 T cells were incubated for 24 hours with MV obtained from GBM \nU373 cell line by differential centrifugation. After incubation, we ana -\nlyzed the activation state of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells by measuring the expression \nof CD69 by flow cytometry, and the production of TNF-\u03b1 by ELISA. \nOur results indicated that U373-derived MV induced an increase in \nthe expression of CD69 ( p<0.01, n= 6) and TNF-\u03b1 secretion ( p<0.05, \nn= 5) in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Our finding suggests that the GBM-derived MV \nobtained from the cell line U373 can activate \u03b3\u03b4 T cells.\n243.

Boston, \nMA, USA.\nCeramide 1-Phosphate (C1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid released \nfrom dying cells after inflammation, increasing locally in the dam -\naged tissue. C1P exerts many biological effects depending on the \ncell type, including the downregulation of inflammatory mediators \nand activation markers. Given that macrophages are critical players \nfor both, resolution of inflammation and tissue restoration, here we \naimed to decipher the effect of this sphingolipid on human mono -\ncytes/macrophages (M\u00f8) under inflamed tissue conditions and pre -\ndict the M\u00f8 fate and behavior. Human CD14+ monocytes (Mo) were \nisolated from PBMCs of healthy donors, cultured with RPMI+10% \nFBS + M-CSF (50ng/ml), and stimulated with C1P short chain an -\nalog C8-C1P (1 and/or 20\u00b5M), together with naturally occurring \ninflamogens, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and hyaluronate (HA); the im -\nmune-characterization was performed by flow cytometry and qPCR. \nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out including all \nevaluated parameters; for correlation significance, p\u22640.05  was con -\nsidered. Firstly, C1P-primed Mo (1, 20 or 1+20 \u00b5M) gave rise to tran -\nscriptionally different M\u00f8 compared to the untreated cells. The more \nexplicative dimensions (Dim1= 26.2% & Dim2=20.9%) predict that \nPDGF, MER, FGF2, PPARG, LXRA, TGFB1, MMP9, VEGFA, and \nGAS6 are the more contributing variables that segregate C1P-treat -\ned from non-treated cells. In addition, when Mo were also chal -\nlenged with LTA and HA and polarization markers were considered, \nCD206+CD163+, CD64+CD206/CD163- percentages, CD163, \nCD206 and CD11b MFI and mRNA levels of MER were referred as \nthe main variables explaining 55.6% of total variation (Dim1= 36.5% \nand Dim2 = 19.1%). These findings highlight that monocytes primed \nwith a high concentration of C1P, and under inflamed tissue condi -\ntions would skew macrophages to a pro-resolving program over the \ninflammatory license. Integrating, C1P is a key messenger also in \nmacrophages to promote pro-inflammatory deactivation and tissue \nregeneration.\n244.

The aim of this work was to investigate \nthe underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. Primary cultures \nof murine astrocytes were infected or not with B. abortus  for 24 h. \nAfter that, cell-free culture supernatants were used to stimulate pri -\nmary co-cultures of murine neurons/microglia during 48 h. Neuronal \ndensity was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. Blocking the \nphagocytic receptor vitronectin in microglia using the cRGD peptide \n(an antagonist specific for this receptor) was sufficient to prevent \nneuronal loss (p<0.005) without accumulation of apoptotic neurons \nand without inhibiting microglia activation (evaluated by secretion \nof TNF-\u03b1 and proliferation; p>0.05) in co-cultures treated with su -\npernatants from infected astrocytes. Our previous results demon -\nstrated that IL-6 secreted by B. abortus -infected astrocytes is at \nleast one mediator involved in neuronal death through bystander \nactivated-microglia. Neutralization of IL-6 in culture supernatants of \ninfected astrocytes did not change microglial proliferation (assessed \nby microscopy; p>0.05) or microglial secretion of TNF-\u03b1 (measured \nby ELISA; p>0.05), although did cause a reduced phagocytic activ -ABSTRACTS153\nity of microglia (evaluated by phagocytosis assay with negatively \ncharged fluorescent 5 \u03bcm beads; p<0.05). In summary, our results \nindicate that neuronal death induced by bystander activation of mi -\ncroglial cells occurs by vitronectin receptor-mediated phagocytosis \nof viable neurons through IL-6. Bystander activation of non-infected \nmicroglia could be a mechanism involved in neuronal death during \nneurobrucellosis.\n245.

Hospital General de Agudos Fern\u00e1ndez\nSmilax campestris is an Argentinian plant traditionally used to treat \ninflammatory skin disorders. Arsenic causes a skin disease known \nas HACRE and mitochondrial damage with pro-inflammatory ef -\nfects. Mitophagy (MF) ensures mitochondrial quality. We have pre -\nviously shown that arsenic trioxide (ATO) increases IL-1 secretion in \nhuman keratinocytes (HaCaT) that can be reduced by drug-induced \nMF. Here we explore if an aqueous extract of Smilax campestris \n(SME) induces MF and reverts ATO-induced IL-1 production in Ha -\nCaT cells. Mitochondrial mass (MM) was evaluated with the probe \nNAO by flow cytometry. MF was assessed with Hoescht, lysotracker, \nNAO, expression of Emerald Green-p62, and a mitochondria-target -\ned tandem EGFP-RFP protein (mtTan), by image cytometry. IL-1 \nlevels were measured by ELISA. We observed that SME (0.1-10\u03bcM) \ndecreased MM. ATO-treated cells showed decreased IL-1 produc -\ntion when co-treated with SME (p<0.005). SME (5-10\u03bcM) decreased \nMM in ATO-treated cells (p<0.01). SME increased rounded mito -\nchondria, often associated with MF (p<0.001). SME-treated cells \nshowed increased colocalization of lysosomes and mitochondria \n(p<0.001); colocalization was decreased by chloroquine (CQ), indi -\ncating inhibition of MF (p<0.001). 10\u03bcM SME induced bright spots \nin cells expressing p62EG (p<0.001) and decreased colocalization \nof red and green fluorescence in cells expressing mtTan indicating \ninduction of MF (p<0.001). ATO-treated cells also showed increased \ncolocalization of lysosomes and mitochondria (p<0.001). CQ caused \nno change in colocalization rate, which indicated blockage of MF in \nATO-treated cells. In contrast, ATO-treated cells exposed to SME \nshowed decreased colocalization with CQ (p<0.001), indicating that \nSME restored MF. In conclusion, SME induced mitophagy in untreat -\ned keratinocytes, and decreased IL-1 levels, decreased MM, and \nrestored mitophagic flux in ATO-treated cells. SME improves mito -\nchondrial quality and restrains the pro-inflammatory effects of ATO.\n246.

Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas \n- UNC.\nInnate CD8+ T cells (TIM cells) mature in the thymus as a different \nlineage from conventional simple positive CD8+ thymocytes and are \nexported to SLO as a conventional T cell. TIM cells play a protective \nrole during the early phase of infectious processes as reported for \ncertain bacteria, viral and parasite infections. We have previously \nreported that thymi from T. cruzi -infected mice are highly enriched \non TIM cells. Functionally, TIM cells act in a TCR-independent way \nbut can exert their cytotoxic capacity through the release of perforin/\ngranzyme. It is also postulated that TIM cells can induce cell death through the killing receptor NKG2D. NKG2D recognizes infected \ncells expressing different families of ligands, especially RAE-1 re -\nceptors. However, this cytolytic mechanism is still poorly described.\nWe evaluated the killing capacity of a bulk population of thymo -\ncytes obtained from T.cruzi -infected or control mice (efectors) when \nco-cultured with peritoneal macrophages (PM) infected with T.cruzi  \n(targets). As a read-out we evaluated 48h later, the number of para -\nsite either inside macrophages (by IF) or in the culture supernatants \n72h later. In both cases, we observed a reduced number of parasite \nwhen macrophages were co-cultured with T.cruzi -infected thymo -\ncytes (<0,05). \nInterestingly, PM stimulation with different TLR agonists demon -\nstrate up-regulation of RAE-1 g only after PolyI:C but not after LPS \nor PGN stimulation (<0,05). Also, PM obtained from T.cruzi -infect -\ned mice show significantly higher RAE-1 g expression than PM from \ncontrol mice  (<0,05) becoming a possible target of NKG2D+ TIM cells. \nOur data intend to contribute in the understanding of the effectors \nmechanisms of TIM cells. \n247.

Buenos Aires, Argentina. 4 \nCl\u00ednica del Ni\u00f1o de Quilmes. Buenos Aires, Argentina. \nBACKGROUND:  Evidence implicates neutrophils in the pathophys -\niology of severe COVID-19. Activated and injured cells release their \nstores of ATP to the extracellular space, with ATP being generally \nexcitatory to most cells trough purinergic receptors. Here we ana -\nlyzed plasma levels of ATP in children with COVID-19 and the ability \nof extracellular purines to modulate the functions of neutrophils from \nchildren with COVID-19.\nMETHODS: Sixty  acute COVID-19 infected children (1-16 years-old) \nand 20 healthy children (HC) were studied. Levels of ATP were mea -\nsured in plasma by Luminometry. Purified neutrophils were exposed \nto ATP and/or adenosine agonist. Phenotype and ROS production \nwere analyzed by flow cytometry. NETs release was measured by \nFluorometry. Levels of IL-8 were quantified by ELISA.\nRESULTS:  We found higher levels of ATP in plasma from COVID-19 \npatients, mainly in those with pneumonia compared with HC \n(p<0.01) and increased expression of ectoenzyme CD39 in neutro -\nphils (p<0.05). When neutrophils were exposed to Bz-ATP during 3 \nhs, an increased expression of activation marker CD11b (p<0.05) \nwas observed and the expression of inhibitory receptor LAIR-1 \n(p<0.01) and calprotectin (p<0.05) were higher in neutrophils from \nCOVID-19 children, but not in neutrophils from HC. Importantly, \nBz-ATP exposure promoted PMA-induced NETosis in COVID-19 \nneutrophils (p<0.005) showing no changes in HC. Also, CGS, an \nadenosine agonist, reduced significantly NETs release (p<0.007). \nBy contrast, Bz-ATP significantly impaired the spontaneous produc -\ntion of IL-8 in neutrophils from patients enhancing the production in \ncontrols (p<0.01). While Bz-ATP exposure did not enhance PMA-in -\nduced ROS production, CGS promoted its fall in patients (p<0.01).\nCONCLUSION:  Our results suggest a relationship between the \npurinergic signaling and the inflammation caused by neutrophils in \nchildren with COVID-19. Further studies are needed to assess how \ntargeting purinergic signaling prevent severe disease.\n248.

Circulating neutrophils (PMN) appear activated \nduring pregnancy and even more in pregnancies complicated by \npreeclampsia. Metabolic regulation underlies the functional profiling \nof immune cells in a number of settings but immunometabolic repro -\ngramming in the context of pregnancy is still enigmatic.\nWe have shown that conditioned media (CM) from human first tri -\nmester Tb (Swan-71 cell line) inhibit PMA-induced neutrophil ex -\ntracellular trap formation, promote PMN apoptosis and induce an \nangiogenic profile on PMN.\nThe aim of this work  was to explore the effect of trophoblast \ncell-derived factors in neutrophils\u2019 functional and metabolic profile.\nNeutrophils from healthy donors were cultured with Swan-71 condi -\ntioned media (CM)-2% FCS. PMN activation profiles were assessed \nby RT\u2010qPCR and flow cytometry. Treg modulation was explored \nco-culturing PMN with autologous mononuclear cells and CD4, \nFOXP3 staining. Glucose uptake and intracellular lipid accumulation \nwere determined by flow cytometry using the glucose fluorescent \nanalog 2-NBDG or BODIPY 493/503, respectively.\nPMN pre-incubated with CM increased the frequency of double \nstained CD4+ FOXP3+ cells in co-cultures, compared to 2% serum \nmedia (basal) (% X\u00b1SE Basal 3.85\u00b10.64 CM 9.97\u00b13.38, P<0.05, \nn=6). Regarding neutrophils\u2019 metabolism, PMN cultured with CM \nincreased glucose uptake (MFI X\u00b1SE Basal 897.3\u00b1195.4; CM \n1112\u00b1244.8, P<0.05, n=10) although to a lower extent than PMA. \nA trend increase in the glucose specific transporter GLUT1 was ob -\nserved. CM also favored lipid droplet formation (MFI X\u00b1SE Basal \n997.7\u00b193.4 CM 1318.0\u00b1115.5, P<0.05, n=8). \nOur results support an immunometabolic programing of neutrophils \nupon trophoblast cell interaction in an in vitro model of early mater -\nnal-placental interface.\n249.

However, little is known about the effect of malnutrition on \nthe nasopharynx-associated-lymphoid-tissue (NALT). In addition, \nimmunobiotic lactic acid bacteria and its postbiotics became an \ninteresting and non-invasive alternative for the recovery of the re -\nspiratory immune response in malnourished hosts. We demonstrat -\ned that Lactobacillus rhamnosus  CRL1505 peptidoglycan (PG05) \nincreases the infection resistance against Streptococcus pneumo -\nniae (Sp) and improves innate immune response in immunocom -\npromised-malnourished mice. The aim of this work was to study the \neffect of nasal administration of L. rhamnosus  CRL1505 (Lr05) and \nPG05 on the recovery of NALT in malnourished mice. Weaned mice \nwere malnourished with a protein-free diet (PFD) for 21d. Malnour -\nished mice received a balanced conventional diet (BCD) during 7d \n(BCD group) or BCD with nasal supplementation with L. rhamnosus  \nCRL1505 (108 cells/mouse/day) or PG05 (8\u00b5g/mouse/day) during \nthe last 2 days of treatment (BCD+Lr or BCD+PG groups). Mal -\nnourished control mice (MC) received PFD while the well-nourished \ncontrol group (WC) consumed BCD. Histological studies and flow \ncytometry studies were carried out on NALT to study the impact on \nB and T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and myeloid cells. Pro -\ntein-malnutrition significantly reduced the number of total cells and \nthe different cell populations. These results were related to a NALT \natrophy in the malnourished mice. BCD treatment was not able to \nnormalize these parameters. However, the BCD+Lr and BDC+PG \ngroups showed histological characteristics similar to the WC group, \nand normal numbers of NALT B, T, dendritic cells and neutrophils. These results highlight the importance of NALT as a target for post -\nbiotics and immunobiotics administration to improve respiratory im -\nmunity in immunocompromised malnourished hosts.\n250.

Patients undergoing chemotherapy have an impairment in he -\nmatopoiesis associated with an ineffective immune response against \ninfections. Lactobacillus rhamnosus  CRL1505 (Lr05) and its cell wall \n(CW05) diet supplementation has proved to be an interesting alter -\nnative to improve steady-state myelopoiesis. In this work we studied \nthe effect of oral administration of Lr05 and CW05 on the emergency \nmyelopoiesis induced by TLR4 agonist in immunosuppressed mice. \nAdult Swiss-mice were orally treated with Lr05 or CW05 during 10 \nconsecutive days. On day 6, treated and untreated mice received \none intraperitoneal dose of cyclophosphamide (Cy 150mg/kg). On \nday 3 post-Cy injection, mice were challenged intraperitoneal with \nLPS (10mg/kg weight). At different post-challenge times, the fol -\nlowing studies were carried out: 1) recruitment of phagocytic cells \n(neutrophils and macrophages) in peritoneal lavage; 2) frequency \nof hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+), and myeloid \nmultipotent precursors (MMPs) (Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+CD34+) in BM and; \n3) release of neutrophils from myelopoietic niches by the expression \nof CXCR4 and CD62L in BM Gr-1+Ly6G+Ly6C- cells. The Cy group \nshowed an impaired local innate immune response, a decrease of \nHSCs and MMPs, and an anchoring of myeloid precursors in BM. \nHowever, Lr05 and CW05 treatments were effective to significant -\nly increase peritoneal neutrophils and macrophages, and allow \nan early HSCs and MMPs recovery with respect to the Cy group. \nThese results were correlated with a decrease in the retention sig -\nnals in the BM cells of Lr05 or CW05 groups compared to the Cy \ncontrol. In conclusion, the postbiotic obtained from L. rhamnosus \nCRL1505 is capable of modulating a more efficient local innate im -\nmune response. This in turn could be correlated with the modulation \nof chemokines responsible for stimulating an adequate emergency \nmyelopoietic response in BM against the pathogen.\n251.

STEC release Stx in the gut, which \nupon translocation to the bloodstream reaches target organs like \nkidneys and brain, being responsible for HUS pathophysiology. This \ntranslocation can be facilitated by mucosal damage and promoted \nby inflammation.ABSTRACTS155\nWe previously determined that neutrophils (N) isolated from human \nperipheral blood release Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) when exposed to \nSTEC but not to bacterial supernatants.  Here we investigated the \nrequirements and mechanisms involved in N IL-1\u03b2 secretion in re -\nsponse to STEC (serotype O157:H7) by analyzing IL-1\u03b2 secretion at \na multiplicity of infection of 0.5, at which the maximal secretion was \npreviously observed. We found that the STEC, an isogenic mutant \nof STEC lacking the ability to produce Stx, and a non-pathogenic \nE. coli  strain (C600) stimulated IL-1\u03b2 release. However, IL-1\u03b2 lev -\nels were significantly higher in response to the pathogenic strains \nindependently of their ability to produce Stx (p<0.05; n=7). These \ndifferences were not due to variations in the capacity of each strain \nto promote N lytic death, because LDH levels in coculture super -\nnatants were low and similar for all the strains (n=4). N IL-1\u03b2 se -\ncretion required bacterial viability because none of the heat-killed \nbacterial strains induced IL-1\u03b2 release (p<0.05; n=4). We also found \nthat STEC stimulated N caspase-1 activation (n=4); and accordingly, \nthe caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CMK significantly reduced IL-1\u03b2 \nsecretion (p<0.05; n=4). Altogether, our results suggest that N re -\ncruited into the STEC-infected gut might contribute to the inflamma -\ntory response triggered by the infection by secreting IL-1\u03b2 through a \nmechanism that involves inflammasome activation.\n252.

The aim of \nthis work was to study the role of healthy donors\u2019 plasma EVs (pEVs) \nin the modulation of the  inflammatory response elicited by a viral \nPAMP in monocyte-derived macrophages  with either inflammatory \n(GM-MDMs) or resolution (M-MDMs) profiles.\npEVs were isolated  from plasma samples by size exclusion chro -\nmatography, followed by centrifugation.  Human monocytes were \nisolated from healthy donors\u2019 buffy coats via  density gradient cen -\ntrifugation followed by positive isolation with CD14 magnetic beads, \nand differentiated  with M-CSF or GM-CSF for 7 days. Macrophages \nwere stimulated  with the TLR 7/8 agonist resiquimod (RSQ) for 24 h  \nin the presence or absence of pEVs. The production of  cytokines in \ncell culture supernatants was evaluated by cytokine bead  array and \nELISA. Characterization and purity of EVs were assessed  by west -\nern blotting. Several signaling pathways were studied by phospho \narray and western blot assays.\nEV-treatment of M-MDM exposed to RSQ significantly reduced the \nsecretion of IL-6 and TNF and increased the secretion of IL-10, as \ncompared to only RSQ treated cells. In contrast, GM-MDMs co-stim -\nulated with RSQ and EVs presented an increased IL6 response \nwhile no changes were observed in TNF or IL10 secretion. Signaling \nanalyses further performed on M-MDMs indicated that  EV-treatment \nreduced phosphorylation of activation pathways, such as MAPK and \nAKT.\npEVs appear to have an homeostatic role on M-MDMs exposed to \na viral PAMP by reducing their inflammatory response. In contrast, \npEVs are not able to modulate pro- inflammatory GM-MDMs. Further \nstudies are needed to identify the cargo molecules responsible for \nthese effects. Understanding in-vivo implications of these findings \nmay lead to new therapies development for chronic inflammation.\n253.

Human monocytes were isolated from \nhealthy donors\u2019 buffy coats via density gradient centrifugation fol -\nlowed by positive isolation with CD14 magnetic beads, and differen -\ntiated with M-CSF for 7 days. Resiquimod (RSQ), a TLR-7/8 agonist, \nwas used as a viral PAMP. Apoptotic-cell phagocytosis was evaluat -\ned by flow cytometry. Expression of selected genes was assessed \nby qPCR. Phosphorylated signaling proteins were detected by WB. \nPGE2 was detected by a competitive assay.\nMacrophages exposed to RSQ in the presence of pEVs showed \nincreased apoptotic-cell phagocytosis and expression of VEGFa, \nCD300e, RGS2 and THBS1 transcripts at 4h and 24h. They also \npresented higher levels of PGE2 in 24h-supernatants, and augment -\ned pCREB at 20 min post-stimuli.\nTo conclude, pEVs promote a growth-promoting and wound-healing \nphenotype on M- CSF macrophages exposed to RSQ, which may \ncontribute to inflammation resolution. Although further studies are \nneeded, we propose that by stimulating PGE2 production and CREB \nmediated transactivation, pEVs dampen macrophage activation fol -\nlowing an encounter with a viral PAMP.\n254.

Ex -\nperiments in cell lines showed that Np promoted a higher cell stim -\nulation with enhanced IL-1\u03b2 secretion than the positive  control with \nan inflammasome activator (P<0.05). The IL-1\u03b2 production was ab-\nrogated with different inflammasome inhibitors. In vivo experiments \nshowed that Np protected OVA through the mucosa passage, with a \nsignificant induction of serum OVA-specific IgG, increased  secretion \nof IFN-\u03b3 by spleen cells and high frequency of LT CD4+ IFN-\u03b3+ and \nLT CD8+IFN-\u03b3+ cells (p<0.05).\nIn conclusion, we found that  APC internalized Np and activated \nthe inflammasome pathway with IL-1\u03b2 secretion.  Remarkably, this \nnanoparticle exhibited adjuvant properties for mucosal targeting to \ninduce Th1-dependent  immunity that could be exploited in preven -\ntive or therapeutic vaccine development for infectious and non-  in-\nfectious diseases, respectively.MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

C23 cytosolic roles were \nunknown in innate immunity, so, we searched alterations in pro -\nteins likely connected to C23 such as: a) CK2 and CDK kinases, b) \np21waf1 (as partner of C23, CK2 and CDK), c) Pin1 as CDK target \nsite phospho-dependent isomerase. We optimized assays to study \nCK2 and CDK as C23 kinases. Differentiated THP-1 cells ingested \nlive or heat-killed M.avium. After time-courses, cells were harvested \nand cytosolic and membrane proteomes radiolabeled in reactions \nwith or without inhibitors or substrates, then gel-resolved by 1D and \n2D to analyze C23 RL level. Kinases activities were assayed by pep -\ntides containing C23 sites. Reproducible (in >95% replicates) signif -\nicant time-dependent events were considered. The n for assays or \nfor cell treatments was 5 to 9. We found that: 1) C23 downregulation \nquantitated sensitively by RL was likely caused by cleavage at 2 \nsites, not due to altered CK2 or CDKs and initially independent on \nbacterial viability. 2) cytosolic C23 was iv labeled by CK2 but not \nCDKs. 3) by WB, cytosolic p21 had cleavage. 4) C23 cleavage oc -\ncurred also in endomembranes. 5) Pin1 was not controlling CDK \nsites in vitro. 6) C23 had different phospho-pattern in monocytes and \nmacrophages. We conclude that the decreased C23 IV RL was due \nto cleavage but not kinases or Pin1. Since M. avium did not induce \nmacrophage death, C23 cleavage might be a marker of sustained \napoptosis signaling not resulting in death. Apoptotic bacteria should \nbe compared. Our methods will allow finding protein complexes and \ninnate receptors inducing p21 and C23 cleavage. C23 RNA-binding \nphosphoprotein might be a checkpoint hub integrating p21, CDK \nand CK2 with innate receptors and with pathways in nucleolus, \nmembranes and cytosol. Infection cleaved C23, so, its fragments \nand other PTMs should be studied\n256.

Our previous studies \nhave shown that Lactobacillus rhamnosus  CRL1505 (Lr05) and its \npostbiotics, peptidoglycan (PG05) and cell wall (CW05), were able \nto improve bone marrow (BM) myelopiesis and to protect against \nrespiratory pathogens in mice undergoing chemotherapy. Howev -\ner, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Hence, the role \nof TLR2 and G-CSF involved in the ability of Lr05, P05 and CW05 \nto induce basal myelopoiesis by direct or indirect interaction with \nBM hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) was evaluated. \nFirst, in vitro  colony-forming unit assays were performed to assess \nwhether the clonogenic capacity of BM cells responds to direct inter -\naction with Lr05 and its postbiotics. For this, mouse BM cells were \nplated in the presence or absence of Lr05, PG05 or CW05 in culture \nmedium for the granulocyte/macrophage forming unit (CFU-GM) \n(MethoCult\u2122 GFM3534). The counts and the phenotypic charac -\nterization of the colonies obtained were determined. Besides, the \neffect of the addition of fibroblast supernatants conditioned by Lr05 or its postbiotics on the clonogenic activity of HSPC was investigat -\ned. Finally, the expression of TLR2 of CFU-GM and the levels of \nG-CSF in the culture medium on day 14 were determined by flow \ncytometry and ELISA, respectively. Lr05 significantly stimulated the \nTLR2 expression and secretion of G-CSF, and enhanced the clono -\ngenic activity of HSPC and fibroblast. Interestingly, CW05 showed \na strong stimulatory effect while PG05 showed immune effects that \nwere more similar to Lr05. These results allow us to know, at least \nin part, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the my -\nelopoiesis-enhancing capacity of new safe products to be potentially \nused in patients undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment.\n257.

Interestingly, this reduction was abro -\ngated with ZIKV NS4b C100S mutant (ANOVA+Tukey\u00b4s, p<0.05). \nMoreover, A549 cells transfected with plasmid encoding ZIKV NS4b \nand stimulated with poly(I:C) secreted less IFN-\u03b2 levels (ELISA) \ncompared to control (ANOVA+Tukey\u00b4s, p<0.05).\nTBK1, a key component in IFN I production, has been proposed \nas a possible target of NS4b. Using transfection assays in Hela \ncells, we showed that TBK1 immunoprecipitated with ZIKV NS4b. \nFurthermore, we recombinantly produced N-terminal ZIKV NS4B in \nmicelles and human TBK1. We performed Surface Plasmon Res -\nonance (SPR) assays to further characterize this interaction. SPR \nassays showed that NS4b interacted with TBK1 with an equilibrium \ndissociation constant (KD) of 3.1 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5M.\nOur results add evidence that ZIKV NS4b is involved in disrupting \nTBK1/IRF3 cascade and the conserved residue C100 is important \nfor this function. Besides, this is the first report of biophysical inter -\naction between N-terminal ZIKV NS4b and TBK1. Altogether, the \ninformation gathered herein can be of substantial use in the rational \ndesign of antiviral inhibitors.\n258.

Mintho -\nstachys verticillata  essential oil (EO) has shown antioxidant and \nimmunomodulating activities and could be a natural alternative to \nimprove animal health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the \nimpact of EO oral administration on gastrointestinal proinflammato -\nry parameters. For this purpose, three groups of male Balb/c mice \n(n=3) were orally administered with saline solution (control group) \nand EO (5 or 10 mg/kg/day) during 10 consecutive days. Subse -\nquently, histological parameters, cytokines production and oxida -\ntive markers were evaluated. The results indicated that EO (5 mg/\nkg/day) improved mice growth performance compared to control \nand EO (10 mg/kg/day) groups (p<0.05). EO did not alter the mor -\npho-physiology of intestine, however a moderate leukocyte infiltra -\ntion in the small intestine could be observed in mice treated with \nEO (10 mg/kg/day). No differences in colon sections were observed \nbetween groups. EO decreases the IL-6 levels and increases the \nIL-4 and IL-10 concentrations compared to control group (p<0.05). \nEO improved total antioxidant capacity by decreasing malondialde -\nhyde (MDA) concentrations, however also decreased the enzymatic \nactivity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), compared to control group \n(p<0.05). Results indicate that M. verticillata  EO modulate inflam -\nmatory and oxidative parameters constituting a natural alternative \nwhich could be applied as dietary supplement to improve gastroin -\ntestinal and immune functionality of farm animals.\n259.

The microenvironment where \nthe infection develops is rich in cytokines and chemokines produced \nby the host in response to the bacteria, however, the direct effect of \nthese inflammatory mediators on S. aureus  has not been elucidated. \nThe aim of this study was to determine if S. aureus  is able to sense \nhost\u2019s IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 and the impact of these molecules in the ex -\npression of staphylococcal virulence factors. We first explored the \nbinding of IL-1\u03b2 or IL-8 to S. aureus by flow cytometry incubating the \nbacteria with the recombinant interleukins and ulterior labeling with \nspecific antibodies. An increase in the mean fluorescence intensity \nwas observed in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching max -\nimum levels with 1ng of IL-1\u03b2 and 1.5ng of IL-8 per 5x106 CFU of S. \naureus . We then evaluated the hemolytic and coagulase activity of \nS. aureus  culture supernatants grown in the presence or absence \nof IL-1\u03b2 or IL-8. For both, IL-1\u03b2 ( p<0.01) and IL-8 ( p=0.068), a de -\ncrease in the hemolysis of rabbit red blood cells was observed com -\npared with the control supernatant (Student t Test). IL-8 also induced \na significant decrease in the coagulase activity of S. aureus (p<0.05, \nStudent t Test). To determine the regulatory factors involved in the \nresponse to IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8, we analyzed the expression levels of \nthe global regulators RNAIII (effector of agr) and saeRS when bac -\nteria was grown in the presence or absence of the IL-1\u03b2 or IL-8. \nIL-1\u03b2 induced a significant decrease in RNAIII ( p<0.05) and saeRS \n(p<0.001) levels but, interestingly, no effect was observed in the \npresence of IL-8 (Student t Test). Taken together, our results indi -\ncate that IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 bind to S. aureus  and induce different mod -\nifications in global regulators that affect bacterial toxicity and may \ncontribute to adaptation during infection.\n260.

The etiologic \nagent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (Mtb) is transmitted by air and \ncaptured by lung macrophages (Mf). Mf activation along with an effi -\ncient cellular immune response is required for Mtb elimination, which \nat the same time can mediate tissue damage. We previously found \nthat TB patients at the time of diagnosis showed an immune-endo -\ncrine imbalance: high plasma levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory \nmediators and cortisol, as well as lowered Dehydroepiandrosterone \n(DHEA) levels. During the specific anti-TB treatment, the proinflam -\nmatory mediators and DHEA levels reach values like those found in \nhealthy controls. Rifampicin (R) is a potent antimicrobial agent and \na major drug in TB treatment, its antibacterial activity is mediated by \nthe inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase. There is evidence that \nR also modulates the host immune response, influencing lympho -\ncyte migration, cytokine production and phagocytosis. In a previous \nstudy on a Mf cell line, DHEA treatment decreased the colony-form -\ning units of Mtb even in the presence of stressful and physiologi -\ncal doses of cortisol, an effect related to an increase in the number \nof autophagosomes. Given this background, we now investigated \nwhether R, with or without DHEA, could affect the functional ca -\npacity of Mf (adherent human THP-1 cells, activated with PMA). TB \npatients under treatment show R plasma levels between 8\u201324 \u00b5g/\nml. In a dose response study (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 \u00b5g/ml) the 15 \u00b5g/ml \ndose was selected. When Mf were treated with R or DHEA (10-6M, \n10-7M, 10-8M), there were no differences in supernatants levels of the \npro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2. However, the addition of R+DHEA \nsignificantly decreased IL-1\u03b2 production regarding Mf untreated cul -\ntures (p<0.05 for all DHEA doses). Rifampicin, in addition to its an -\ntibacterial effect contributes with DHEA anti-inflammatory response.\n261.

Besides Stx, inflammatory response mediated by neutro -\nphils (PMN) is essential to HUS outcome. PMN have the capacity \nto release \u201cneutrophil extracellular traps\u201d (NETs) which are involved \nin the pathogenesis of several diseases. Particularly, we have previ -\nously demonstrated that Stx type 2 (Stx2) is able to induce NETosis \nin PMN from healthy donors. The aim of this study was to evaluate \nthe mechanisms involved in the NETosis triggered by Stx2 in PMN. \nTo achieve this, PMN were purified from healthy blood donors and \nincubated for 4 h with RPMI medium alone (Basal), Stx2 (0.1 \u00b5g/\nmL) alone or with commercial inhibitors of NOX2 (DPI, 10 \u00b5M) or \nElastase (EI, 10 \u00b5M). After incubation, supernatants were recov -\nered and the DNA content was evaluated by a fluorometric assay by \nemploying Sybr Gold and the Neutrophil Elastase (NE) activity was \nassessed by a spectrophotometric assay (absorbance at 405 nm). \nWe observed a 2-fold increase value of DNA over the control (Basal) \nafter incubation with Stx2 which was impaired by the presence of \nboth inhibitors, (Median (IQR)= Basal: 1; Stx2:1.91(1.46-2.40)*; Stx -\n2+DPI: 0.97 (0.75-2.36); Stx2+EI:1.16 (0.79-2.18); *p<0.05; n=8). \nSimultaneously, there was a similar increase in elastase activity \nupon treatment with Stx2 which was also reduced by both inhibitors \n(Median (IQR)= Basal:1;Stx:1.89* (1.34-2.63); Stx2+DPI:1.22 (0.57-\n2.11); Stx2+EI:0.64(0.30-1.03); *p<0,05;n=5. \nOur results suggest that Stx2 is able to trigger NETosis by a mecha -MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

STEC are non-in -\nvasive bacteria that colonize the intestine where they release the \nStx, which then reaches the bloodstream; an event that appears to \nbe facilitated by damages in the intestinal mucosa and promoted by \ninflammation. As neutrophils (N) are recruited to the intestine upon \nSTEC infections, our aim was to evaluate whether they contribute \nto the gut inflammatory response by producing cytokines. We previ -\nously determined that STEC (E. coli O157:H7 strain), independently \nof its capacity to produce Stx, stimulates Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) se -\ncretion by human N. Here we evaluated the N cytokine respons -\nes when challenged with STEC within a range of multiplicities of \ninfection (MOIs: 0.5-10). We found that IL-1\u03b2 release was higher \nthe lower the MOI was (p<0.05; n=6), indicating that IL-1\u03b2-secretory \nresponse behaves inversely to the number of bacteria that impact \non N. This behavior was not due to N lytic death because low LDH \nlevels were detected in culture supernatants at every MOI evaluat -\ned (n=6). TNF-\u03b1 secretion also was higher at MOI 0.5 and 1 and \ndeclined at MOI 10 (n=6; p<0.05). Contrastingly, N released huge \namounts of CXCL8 at every MOI evaluated, being the levels slightly \nlower at MOI 0.5 (N=6; p<0.05). On the other hand, N also exhibited \nserine proteases (NSPs) activation in response to STEC (n=4), and \nin agreement with the requirement of NSPs activation for IL-1\u03b2 se -\ncretion we previously reported in N, the SP inhibitor AEBSF concen -\ntration-dependently reduced IL-1\u03b2 secretion (n=3) without affecting \npro-IL-1\u03b2 synthesis (n=2). \nOur results suggest that N recruited to the human gut upon STEC \ninfection might contribute to the development of the inflammatory \nresponse that usually triggers the infection, by secreting the pro-in -\nflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, and the chemokine CXCL-8.\n263.

Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nNeutrophils (N) represent the first line of defense against bacterial \nand fungal infections. These granulocytes, which outnumber the rest \nof human immune cells found in circulation, are massively recruited \nto infectious foci where they contribute to the inflammatory respons -\nes by the release of cytokines. Among them is IL-1\u03b2, a leaderless \nprotein which is synthesized in the cytosol as an inactive precursor, \npro-IL-1\u03b2, that after processing is secreted by unconventional mech -\nanisms. We previously determined that in response to LPS+ATP, hu -\nman N release IL-1\u03b2 by an autophagy-dependent mechanism and that both caspase-1- (C1) and N serine proteases (NSP)-activation \nare required for IL-1\u03b2 secretion. Here we evaluated the role of both \nkinds of enzymes in pro-IL-1\u03b2 processing in N isolated from healthy \ndonors\u2019 peripheral blood. Our findings employing both ELISA and \nwestern blot indicated that inhibition of C1 with Ac-YVAD-CMK (50 \n\u00b5M) reduced IL-1\u03b2 secretion but did not inhibit pro-IL-1\u03b2 cleavage. \nBy contrast, inhibition of NPS with AEBSF (0.35 mM) reduced IL-1\u03b2 \nsecretion and blocked pro-IL-1\u03b2 processing (p<0.05; n=3-5). Sup -\nporting these data, LPS+ATP stimulation triggered NSP activation \n(n=9; p<0.05), evaluated by a fluorescent probe and flow cytometry, \nand their leakage to the cytosol. We also found by employing the \nfluorescent probe FLICA and flow cytometry, higher levels of active \nC1 upon NSPs inhibition, suggesting that these enzymes might also \ncontrol active C1 stability. \nIn contrast to what is observed in other myeloid cells, these findings \nsuggest that even though C1 is necessary for IL-1\u03b2 secretion, in hu -\nman N it is not required for the processing of its precursor. Instead, \nthis role appears to be fulfilled by NSP. These results might have a \npotential impact on the design of new therapeutic strategies to se -\nlectively control inflammation in those scenarios where neutrophilic \nIL-1\u03b2 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis.\n264.

Previously, we demonstrated that type 17 re -\nsponse is crucial to inhibit fungal proliferation after dermatophyte \ninfection in C57BL/6 mice and, in the absence of a functional IL-\n17 pathway in IL-17RAKO mice, fungal burden was significantly \nincreased compared to WT mice. However, the IL-17-mediated ef -\nfector mechanisms that inhibit dermatophyte growth and the role of \nHDP remain undefined.\nThe aim of this work was to evaluate the gene expression of the \nHDP \u03b2-defensins 2, 3 and 14 and calprotectin (S100A9) in the epi -\ndermis of C57BL/6 and IL-17RAKO mice at early time-points of Nan-\nnizzia gypsea  infection.\nC57BL/6 (WT) and IL-17RAKO mice were epicutaneously infected \nwith a N. gypsea mycelia suspension (infected group) or treated with \nsterile saline solution (uninfected controls). On day 1 or 3 post-in -\nfection (dpi), skin was trypsinized, mRNA was extracted, cDNA was \ngenerated and used for quantitative PCR with primers for mBD2 , \nmBD3 , mBD14 , S100A9 , GAPDH  and \u03b2-actin genes.\nDermatophyte -infected WT mice expressed lower levels of mBD2  \ncompared to uninfected controls by 1 dpi (p<0.01) and remained de -\ncreased by 3 dpi (p<0.05) along with diminished mBD3  and mBD14  \nexpression (p<0.0001, p<0.001, 3-day infected mice vs controls). On \nthe contrary, infected IL-17RAKO mice early expressed mBD2  and \nmBD14  mRNA by a 5- and 6-fold change respectively (p<0.0007, \np<0.0012, compared to controls) and continued to be upregulated \nby 3 dpi (p<0.0001, p<0.0007, respectively) along with an increased \nexpression of mBD3  (p>0.003) and S100A9  (p>0.0001), compared \nto controls.\nThese data suggest that, in our model, the susceptibility to fungal \nskin infection in IL-17RAKO mice is uncoupled from mBD2 , mBD3 , \nmBD14 and S100A9 expression . Probably, the elevated fungal \nburden observed in IL-17RAKO induces HDP through IL-17 signal -\nling-independent mechanisms.\n265.

If the response is not properly controlled, that \nrecruitment could be harmful and may contribute to the progression \nof neuroinflammation.\nWe previously found that systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) chal -\nlenge induced glial activation and recruitment of CD45hi leukocytes \nto brain blood vessels, in circumventricular organs. During systemic \ninflammation interferon-gamma (IFN- \u03b3) is induced and participate \nin the inflammation observed in different target organs.  How -\never, little is known about the impact of this cytokine in the CNS \nimmune cells during this process. \nMethods: we injected PBS or LPS (1.6 mg/kg, i.p.) to wild type (WT) \nC57BL/6 strain and IFN- \u03b3 knockout (KO) mice (n=4). After perfu -\nsion, we processed the brains to isolate the immune cells for stain -\ning and measuring them by flow cytometry. \nWe performed conventional and high dimensional flow cytometry \nanalysis to study the different immune cells populations.\nResults: LPS systemic stimuli increased the monocyte recruitment \nto WT mice brains compared to PBS-injected control group (p<0.05). \nHowever, this effect was not observed in the IFN- \u03b3 KO mice (p NS), \nindicating that the presence of type II interferon participates in the \nresponse that results in the arrival of monocytes to the brain. \nOur preliminary results also showed increased lymphocytes recruit -\nment to the brains of LPS-stimulated WT mice, compared to controls \n(p<0.05). Nevertheless, that increase was impaired in the absence \nof IFN- \u03b3 (p NS). \nConclusion: during mice systemic inflammation, leukocyte recruit -\nment to CNS take place in a type II interferon-dependent manner, \nsuggesting that this cytokine might be an important mediator of neu -\nroinflammatory responses.  \nKeywords: neuroinflammation, microglia, monocytes, type II inter -\nferon, LPS\n266.

Fuertes.\nLaboratorio de Fisiopatolog\u00eda de la Inmunidad Innata. Institu -\nto de Biolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental (IBYME-CONICET)\nNK cells are key effectors against tumor and virus-infected cells. \nHowever, evidence of a regulatory role during autoimmunity and viral \ninfections is emerging. We have identified a subset of immunoregu -\nlatory, PD-L1-expressing tumor-infiltrating NK cells in tumor-bearing \nmice and in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In vitro , PD-L1 \nexpression was induced on NK cells from healthy donors (HD) upon \ntumor cell recognition through NKG2D and was further up-regulated \nby monocyte (Mo)-derived IL-18. To additionally explore this circuit, \nthe aim of this work was to characterize the underlying mechanisms \nthat control IL-18 production by Mo. To this end, peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells (PBMC) from HD were cultured with K562 cells \nin the absence or in the presence of different pharmacological in -\nhibitors of pathways that could lead to IL-18 production. While an \nATP receptor antagonist (A740003) or inhibitors of ROS (catalase), \nNOS (L-NAME), or autophagy (Bafilomycin) had no effect, the in -\nhibition of phagocytosis using cytochalasin D abolished IL-18 se -\ncretion (assessed by ELISA, p<0.0001). Moreover, cytochalasin D completely abrogated PD-L1 up-regulation on NK cells ( p<0.01). \nWhen PBMC were separated from K562 and NK cells using tran -\nswells, IL-18 secretion was totally abolished ( p<0.01), confirming \nthat K562-driven IL-18 production by PBMC required Mo contact \nwith tumor cells. Also, culture of isolated Mo (CD14+ cells) with eFlu -\norDye 670-labeled K562 cells for 15 min resulted in 67.7\u00b15.6% of \nphagocytosis (evaluated as frequency of eFluorDye 670+ CD14+ \ncells by flow cytometry) that was significantly reduced by cytochala -\nsin D (13.4\u00b15.7%, p<0.001). Moreover, IL-18 secretion was induced \nwhen isolated Mo were cultured with K562 cells ( p<0.05), and such \neffect was also blocked by cytochalasin D ( p<0.05). Altogether, our \nresults show that recognition and phagocytosis of tumor cells by \nMo triggers IL-18 secretion that subsequently contributes to PD-L1 \nup-regulation on NK cells.\n267.

The colonic inflam -\nmatory response was analyzed (weight, length, histology, cytokine \ngene expression by qPCR). \nWe found that PA reversed the weight loss of mice with TNBS-in -\nduced colitis (p<0.05). The colon of PA-treated mice showed a de -\ncreased histological score, with less edema and cellular infiltration \nthan those from untreated TNBS-treated mice. Mice treated with PA \nshowed a colon with a lower weight/length ratio than mice from the \nTNBS group (21.56\u00b10.46 vs 32.46\u00b12.26; p<0.05). In concordance, \nwe found a significantly decreased expression and production of \nproinflammatory cytokines (Ccl20, IL-1b, TNF and IFN-\u03b3, p<0.01) \nand lower myeloperoxidase activity in the peptide-treated group \nthan in TNBS-mice (p<0.05). Moreover, we found augmented NF-\n\u03baB p65 levels along with a significantly higher transcript level of the \npeptide transporter PepT1 in mice with colitis than in PA-treated \nmice (p<0.05).\nIn conclusion, our findings indicated that peptides from Amaranth \nexert a mucosal anti-inflammatory effect that suppressed the \nTNBS-driven NF-kB-mediated intestinal inflammation that promoted \na Th1-immunity. These findings led us to propose using the ama -\nranth peptide in a functional food with an anti-inflammatory protec -\ntive effect.\n268.

SLAMF1 (Signaling Lymphocytic \nActivation Molecule) is expressed on macrophages and triggers not \nonly phagosome-related functions, but can also recognize and inter -\nnalize different pathogens. CD components regulate macrophages \nfunctions and both toxins and spores invade host cells. However, \nthe endocytosis of the bacteria has not been explored. Here, we \naddress the internalization of CD and the role of SLAMF1 during \nthis process. \nMonocyte-derived macrophages from healthy donors were cultured \nin the presence or absence of CD (NAP1/BI/027 strain)  inactivated \nby heat or formalin treatment ( CDH or CDF). For some experiments \nCD was coupled with FITC and an agonistic antibody for SLAMF1 \nwas added to the cell culture. \nOur results show that SLAMF1 expression is not modulated on hu -\nman macrophages surface by either CDH or CDF, even in the pres -\nence of increasing amounts of bacteria as shown by flow cytometry. \nBiochemical assays were conducted and SLAMF1 detection with \na specific antibody indicated that there is no interaction between \nSLAMF1 and CDH or CDF. Nevertheless, we did detect interaction \nof macrophages with CD. SLAMF1 is also a costimulatory molecule, \nbut SLAMF1 costimulation through an agonistic antibody had no \neffect on the CD-macrophage interaction as measured by flow cy -\ntometry and fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, most of the inter -\nacting macrophages were SLAMF1 negative. Finally, we confirmed \nintracellular localization of C. difficile  in macrophages and a partial \ncolocalization with LAMP2 by confocal microscopy. \nIn conclusion, SLAMF1 does not promote the interaction between \nhuman macrophages and C. difficile  and does not participate in the \ninternalization process of the bacterium. Further studies are needed \nto elucidate the molecules involved  in macrophage entry mecha -\nnisms of C. difficile .\n269.

Our aim \nwas to study the role of BD1 (constitutive) and BD3 (inducible) in the \npathogenesis of VVC using a murine model. Females (8-10-week-\nold C57BL/6J) were treated subcutaneously with \u03b2-estradiol-17\u2013val -\nerate in sesame oil (0.2mg/100\u03bcl) on days (D) -6,-3,2 and 4 post \ninfection(pi). On D0 mice were inoculated intravaginally with C. al -\nbicans SC5314  suspension (5.106 yeasts/PBS)(infected group), or \nuninfected (No-infected group). Animals without any treatment were \nused as controls (untreated). Cervicovaginal lavages (VL) were ob -\ntained for the study of different parameters. Infection was evaluated \nby local fungal load (CFU) and PMNs recruited to vaginal lumen on \nD2,4 and 8 pi. Fungal burden remained stable from D2 to D4, with \na significant decrease at D8(p<0.001), and the PMNs recruitment \nto vaginal lumen reached a peak at D2. Regarding BD1 and BD3 \nstudy, the mRNA (qPCR) and protein expression (immunofluores -\ncence assay) were evaluated in cells recovered from VL. At early \ntimes(D2) a significant increase in mRNA of BD1(p<0.05 vs untreat -\ned group), and BD3(p<0.05 vs No-infected and untreated groups) \nwas observed. Corrected total fluorescence analysis of cytoextend -\ned showed a significant increase of protein expression for both BDs \nin the cytoplasm of epithelial cells (BD1p<0.001;BD3p<0.05). Due \nto the relevant role of BDs in the protection against pathogens and \nin the modulation of the local innate immune response, the knowl -\nedge about their behavior during VVC is relevant to contribute to \nthe understanding of the pathogenesis of this mycosis with elevated incidence and difficult treatment.\n270.

Cardiac inflammation and tissue damage is orchestrated by \nthe infiltration and activation of immune cells including macrophages \n(Mo) into the myocardium. Mo with M1 phenotype (F4/80+ CD11b+ \nCD86+ CD206\u2212) predominate at short times post infection (pi) \nand then they are rapidly polarized toward M2 phenotype (F4/80+ \nCD11b+ CD86\u2212 CD206+) which remains sustained during the in -\nfection. We have showed that in vivo inhibition of Wnt signaling by \ntreatment with IWP-L6 (an inhibitor of Wnt proteins secretion) during \nthe acute phase of T. cruzi infection controls the parasite replication, \ninhibits the development of parasite-prone and fibrosis-prone Th2-\ntype immune response, and prevents the development of chronic \nChagas disease\u2019s cardiac abnormalities. To investigate the role of \nWnt signaling in the modulation of cardiac infiltrating Mo phenotype, \nBALB/c mice infected with 1,000 trypomastigotes of T. cruzi  and \ntreated with IWP-L6 (7.5 mg/kg) or vehicle (control) on days 5, 8, \n11 and 14 pi were sacrificed at day 17 pi. Heart Mo isolated by a se -\nquential combination of washing, mechanical disruption, enzymatic \ndigestion, and density centrifugation using Percoll were stained with \nappropriate antibodies to determine the phenotype by flow cytom -\netry. Results were analyzed with FlowJo (V10.7) using One-way \nANOVA and Tukey\u2019s test for multiple comparison. We found that T. \ncruzi  infection induced an increase of heart Mo (F4/80+ CD11b+) \ninfiltration that was reversed by IWP-L6 treatment ( P<0.05). Com -\npared to non-infected mice, heart of control mice showed increased \nfrequency of M1 (F4/80+ CD11b+ CD86+ CD206\u2212) and M2 (F4/80+ \nCD11b+ CD86\u2212 CD206+) Mo populations, while cardiac tissue of \nIWP-L6-treated mice only showed M1 Mo infiltrate. Thus, these \nresults suggest that Wnt signaling participate in the polarization of \ncardiac Mo towards M2 phenotype.\n271.

In \nthis context, macrophages (Mo) represent one of the main targets \nfor the parasite. Mo are extremely plastic and respond to environ -\nmental signals adopting at least two extreme profiles: Classical M1 \nMo which respond to inflammatory environment increasing CD86 ex -\npression, Nitric Oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokines produc -\ntion, plays a key role in the control of intracellular parasite growth; \nwhereas Alternative M2 Mo which respond to IL-4 with increasing \nCD206 and Arg1 expression and anti-inflammatory cytokines re -\nlease, promotes parasite replication. We have reported that T. cruzi  \ninfection induces Wnt signaling activation in Mo, with the inhibition \nof Wnt proteins secretion (with IWP-L6) modulating the Mo activa -\ntion status to a more microbicidal phenotype. So, infected Mo that ABSTRACTS161\nwere previously treated with IWP-L6, are transcriptionally similar to \ninfected M1 Mo, although does not fully fit the classical M1 transcrip -\ntional pattern. Here, we aim to evaluate the effect of Wnt signaling \ninhibition on the phenotype of infected Mo. For that, bone marrow \nderived Mo were treated with IWP-L6 or Vehicle (V) for 24 h and \ninfected with T cruzi  trypomastigotes (Tps) (Mo:Tps=1:3). Non-in -\nfected, LPS+IFN- g- (M1) and IL4-treated (M2) Mo were used as \ncontrols. Antibody panel for flow cytometry included F4/80, CD11b, \nCD86, CD206, iNOS and Arg1. We observed that while infection of \nMo induces a reduction in the % of CD86+CD206- cells, this effect \nwas not evident in IWP-L6-treated cultures. In addition, cultures of \ninfected IWP-L6-Mo showed lower frequency of total CD206+ cells \n(p<0.05) with lower expression of CD206 in the CD206+CD86+ \npopulation ( p<0.05) when compared with V-treated ones, with not \nsignificant differences in CD86 and iNOS expression. In summa -\nry, Wnt signaling contributes to install M2-phenotypic program in T \ncruzi -infected Mo. \n272.

CIBICI\u2013CONICET, Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica Cl\u00ednica, \nFCQ-UNC, Argentina.\nLeukocyte-specific protein 1 (LSP1) is a 52kDa cytoplasmic F-ac -\ntin binding phosphoprotein expressed in all human and murine \nleukocytes and endothelial cells. LSP1 is an important regulator \nof actin cytoskeleton remodelling. We have previously shown that  \nLsp1-/- dendritic cells (DCs) have a defective antigen presentation \nto CD4+ T cells compared to DCs from wild type (WT) mice. In or -\nder to study whether defective antigen presentation in Lsp1-/- mice \nis due to alteration in MHC class  II dynamics, we evaluated I-Ab \nkinetics expression on cell surface and intracellulary in Lsp1-/- DCs \nupon activation with CpG-ODN.  DCs were in vitro derived from bone \nmarrow precursors with  Flt3-L and stimulated with CpG-ODN 1826, \nat different times (1-2-3-4-8-12  and 18h) they were collected and \nstained with anti-I-Ab antibody (Ab) either permeabilized or not, \nto measure total or cell surface content of I-Ab and analyzed by \nflow cytometry.  We found that total and cell surface I-Ab molecules \nincreases in Lsp1-/- DCs upon stimulation similar than DCs from \nLsp1+/+ mice, with a peak in both cases at 3h.  Intracellular con -\ntent of I- Ab increased more than cell surface expression in both \ngroups and remained high for at least 18h. Analyzing the kinetics of \npeptide-I-Ab complexes on DC  surface by incubating DCs with the \nEa52-68 peptide (which binds to I-Ab) and then labeling them with \nY-Ae Ab (which recognizes I-Ab-Ea52-68 complex) by flow cytom -\netry, we  observed that these complexes remained stable up to 24h \nafter on surface in Lsp1-/- and Lsp1+/+ stimulated DCs at  similar \nlevels. These results suggests that the altered antigen presentation  \nin Lsp1-/- DCs could be related to other steps in Ag processing and \nnot to MHC II dynamics.\n273.

However, \nan exacerbated ERS/UPR was found in endometria of women with recurrent pregnancy loss, suggesting that a rigorous balance is re -\nquired. Considering that stromal cells condition maternal monocytes \nto a tolerogenic dendritic cell profile, here we evaluated the impact \nof ERS/UPR triggered on stromal cells on monocyte differentiation. \nThus, human endometrial stromal cell line (HESC) were treated: +/- \nThapsigargin (an ERS-inducer Tg, 4h) or +/- decidualization stimuli \n(MPA+db-cAMP for 8 days). Conditioned media (CM) were collected \nafter 48h. Then, isolated monocytes from peripheral blood mononu -\nclear cells from healthy women were cultured with rhGM-CSF+rhIL-4 \nfor 5 days in the absence/presence of CM. Monocyte-derived cul -\ntures differentiated with HESC+Tg CM showed a lower frequency of \nCD1a+CD14- cells compared with HESC CM, quantified by FACS \nanalysis (p<0.05, Wilcoxon Test). Also, this CM induced a higher \nIL-1b (p<0.05) and a lower IL-10 secretion on monocyte-derived \ncells accompanied with a higher frequency of CD86hi cells (p<0.05). \nAlso, we observed a higher frequency of apoptotic cells (Annexin \nV+ Propidium Iodide-) in these cultures. Finally, we evaluated the \nexpression of ERS-sensors on monocyte-derived cultures. Whereas \nIRE1a expression was increased, a significant lower expression of \nATF6 was observed on HESC+Tg CM cultures (p<0.05). Surprising -\nly, this effect was also observed when monocytes were differentiated \nin the presence of CM from decidualized cells, suggesting that it \noperates during the decidualization program. These results suggest \nthat ERS might be transmitted from stromal cells to monocytes and \nits fine balance is required to maintain the tolerance needed for suc -\ncessful implantation. \n274.

Eosinophilic inflammatory \nresponses can be associated with food allergy and the underlying \nmechanisms in human colonic mucosa are poorly understood. We \npreviously reported that allergic sensitized pediatric patients with ju -\nvenile polyps (JP) showed local IgE class-switch recombination with \nhigh levels of TSLP, IL-33 and CCL26 (the main chemoattractant for \neosinophils), that might be related with the hypereosinophilia. This \nstudy aimed to investigate the intestinal epithelial cells as a source \nfor these soluble mediators under different inflammatory settings. \nCaco-2 cells were stimulated with IL-13 (10 ng/ml) or IFN-\u03b3 (10 ng/\nml) and CCL26, TSLP and IL-33 were evaluated by ELISA in culture \nsupernatants. Cell activation was analyzed with a tyrosine-kinase \nphosphorylation array and finally, kinase activation was confirmed \nby immunoblotting. \nWe found that TSLP and CCL-26 levels were significantly increased \nin Caco-2 cells in response to IL-13, whereas it remained unchanged \nfollowing the stimulation with IFN-\u03b3. Cell activation was also demon -\nstrated by analyzing the tyrosine-kinase activation, and we found \nthat STAT-3, STAT-6, Lck, Akt, IGF-IR were higher phosphorylated \nthan cells exposed to IFN-\u03b3 or medium. No effect was observed on \nIL-33 under the conditions studied.\nIn conclusion, our findings show that colonic epithelial cells respond \nto a Th2 environment by secreting TSLP, which may promote muco -\nsal type-2 inflammation through ILC2 activation, and CCL26, which \nis probably involved in the eosinophil chemoattraction. The IL-13-\ndriven cell activation involves the STAT3, STAT6 pathways, and oth -\ner kinases.

One key feature \nin the resolution of inflammation is the phagocytosis of apoptotic \nneutrophils by macrophages. Here, we aim to assess the role of \nPGE2 in the acquisition of a resolutive profile by monocyte-derived \nmacrophages.\nHuman monocytes isolated from peripheral blood were cultured \nduring 7 days in the presence of M-CSF (50 ng/ml). PGE2 (1 \u03bcM) \nwas added at culture days 3, 5 or 7 (4 hours before cell collection). \nControl macrophages were cultured without PGE2. For comparison, \nM2-macrophages were generated adding IL-4 (20 ng/ml) for the last \n48 hours of culture.\nTo begin with, we could not detect endogenous production of PGE2 \n(detection limit 10-11 M) at days 1,3, 5 or 7 of macrophage culture. \nTreatment with PGE2 at day 3 or 5, but not at day 7, resulted in \nmacrophages characterized by higher expression of CD14, CD163, \nCD16 and MerTK. (n=5, p<0.05 against control macrophages). \nPresence of PGE2 during differentiation did not modulate the ex -\npression of CD209, CD36 or HLA-DR. In contrast, IL-4 led to a dis -\ntinct phenotype characterized by increased expression of CD209 \nand CD36 and lower CD14. \nPGE2 promoted macrophage capacity to engulf apoptotic neutro -\nphils, as demonstrated by an average 30% increase of phagocytic \nmacrophages (treated vs control, n=6, p<0,01). While addition of \nIL-4 decreased phagocytosis by 20% in control macrophages (n=6, \np<0,05), it did not impact on the phagocytic capacity of PGE2-de -\nrived macrophages.\nIn summary, presence of PGE2 led to macrophages characterized \nby a resolutive profile distinct from the phenotype of macrophages \nobtained with M-CSF alone or M-CSF plus IL-4. Our results highlight \nthe relevance of PGE2 acting on macrophages during the resolution \nprocess.\nINMUNOLOG\u00cdA CL\u00cdNICA\n276.

The urea cycle disorder hyperornithinemia\u2013hy -\nperammonemia\u2013homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome is caused by \nSLC25A15  gene mutations that lead to deficiency of the ORC1 transporter. Interestingly, SLC25A15 mRNA is highly expressed in \nCD4 T lymphocytes. However, immune alterations have not been \nreported in HHH patients up to date. \nMethods. Biochemical and molecular diagnosis of HHH syndrome. \nAssessment of phenotypic and functional immune parameters: \nlymphoproliferation against polyclonal and memory antigens, T \nhelper cell subsets, cytokine secretion in culture supernatants, im -\nmunoglobulin serum levels, and glycosylation of leukocyte surface \nand serum proteins. \nResults.  A 3-years-old Argentinian female patient was admitted to \nthe hospital with an episode of recurrent otitis, somnolence, con -\nfusion and lethargy. Laboratory tests revealed hyperammonemia, \nmetabolic alkalosis, elevated transaminases, haemostasis alter -\nations and increased urinary orotic acid excretion. Noteworthy, \nserum proteinogram showed a reduction in the gamma globulins. \nDirect sequencing of the SLC25A15  gene revealed two novel het -\nerozygous non-conservative substitutions in the exon 6: c.649G>A \n(p.Gly217Arg) and c.706A>G (p.Arg236Gly) confirming the diagno -\nsis of HHH syndrome. In silico  analysis indicated that the mutations \ninhibit ornithine transport almost completely. Interestingly, immune \nanalysis revealed striking phenotypic and functional alterations in \nthe T and B cell compartments and in the glycosylation of serum \nimmunoglobulins. \nConclusions. Our study identified two non-previously described \nmutations in the SLC25A15  gene underlying the HHH syndrome as -\nsociated to functional and phenotypic immunologic alterations that \nwould render patients more susceptible to infections. Our results \nhighlight the importance of a comprehensive analysis to gain further \ninsights in the underlying pathophysiology of the HHH syndrome. \n277.

GRK2 plays a central role in B cell homing by \ninducing S1PR1 (Sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor-1) downregu -\nlation, which allows the lymphocyte to overcome the S1P-mediated \nretention in the blood and to enter into the lymphoid organs guided \nby chemokines. GRK2 also modulates cellular functions such as \nproliferation and survival in different cancer cells. Here we aimed \nto evaluate GRK2 expression in CLL cells and the effect of a GRK2 \ninhibitor, CMPD101 (CMP), on leukemic cell survival, activation and \nmigration.\nLeukemic B cells were obtained from CLL patients\u00b4 peripheral blood. \nGRK2 expression was evaluated by western blot and cell viability \nby flow cytometry (FC) and LDH activity assay. B cell activation, in -\nduced by immobilized anti-IgM mAb, was evaluated by FC. Chemo -\ntaxis assay toward S1P or CXCL12 was carried out using Transwell \nmigration assay.

Statistical significance was determined us -\ning non-parametric tests with the GraphPad Prism software v7.\nWe found that leukemic cells from CLL patients express GRK2 at \nlevels comparable to B cells from healthy donors (n=10). Regarding \nthe effect of GRK2 inhibition on cell viability, we found that CMP used \nin the concentration range of 0.3-100 uM did not affect spontaneous \nor venetoclax-induced apoptosis of leukemic cells (n=10). Further -\nmore, CMP did not affect the up-regulation of CD69 in BCR-stimu -\nlated leukemic cells (n=7). Interestingly, we found that CMP signifi -\ncantly increased leukemic and T cell migration towards S1P, while it \ndid not affect migration towards CXCL12 (p<0.05, n=10).ABSTRACTS163\nOur results suggest that GKR2 inhibition could be used to increase \nCLL cell migration towards S1P and open the possibility to study \nGRK2 as a potential target to induce CLL cell mobilization from lym -\nphoid tissues.\n278.

SOCS proteins exert their action by interacting with Ja -\nnus kinases (JAKs), tyrosine kinase-2 (TYK2) and certain surface \ncytokine receptors. SOCS1 binds and inhibits the phosphorylation \nof JAK1/2 and TYK2, thus acting as a negative regulator of type I \nand II Interferon mediated signals. Aim:  describe clinical features \nand laboratory findings of a patient with a novel SOCS1  variant. Re-\nsults:  8-year-old male, from non-consanguineous parents with no \nrelevant perinatal history. His background includes vitiligo, asthma, \nand splenomegaly with cytopenias. Lung images showed multiple \nbilateral nodules. Lung biopsy: granulomatous-lymphocytic intersti -\ntial lung disease. Malignancies and infectious diseases were ruled \nout. Immunological findings revealed panhypogammaglobulinemia \nand poor polysaccharide response. Low naive T-cells with high ex -\npression of activation markers, increased circulating follicular T cells \nwith a skew towards a Tfh1 profile and elevated double-negative T \ncells with normal FOXp3+ and reduced Th17+ CD4+ T cells. Impaired \nB-cell subsets showed low post-switch memory cells with high fre -\nquencies of CD21low B cells. Normal lymphoprolipheration assay. \nTherefore, he was diagnosed with Common Variable Immunodefi -\nciency with dysregulation and started immunoglobulin replacement. \nWhole exome sequence revealed c.368C>A and c.365G>A variants \nin the same allele of SOCS1  gene. Enhanced phospho-STAT1 kinet -\nic assay confirmed the pathogenic role of these variants. Conclu -\nsion:  In humans, mutation in SOCS1 impacts the STAT1 signaling \npathway thus affecting multiple JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Only \na few patients with SOCS1 mutation have been recently reported \nworldwide with a broad phenotypic spectrum overlapping other in -\nborn errors of immunity. \n279.

Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and Shiga Toxin \n(Stx) are the two main bacterial toxins present in Hemolytic Ure -\nmic Syndrome (HUS) that cause endothelial damage. In this work we aimed to study the response of induced Pluripotent Stem Cells \nderived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (iPSC-MSC) to LPS and/or Stx \nand its effect on the restoration of injured endothelial cells. For \nthis purpose, we stimulate iPSC-MSC with LPS and/or Stx for 24 \nh. using Polymyxin B in the Stx treatments in order to avoid LPS \ncontamination. The results obtained showed that LPS induced a \npro-inflammatory profile on iPSC-MSC with an increment of IL-8 and \nTNF- a, but not Stx when we measure with ELISA kit, (pg/ml IL-8 \nControl: 1988\u00b1299; LPS: 20876\u00b11233*#, Stx: 1801\u00b1137; LPS+Stx: \n17935\u00b1213* and pg/ml of TNF- a  Control:880\u00b132; LPS:3291\u00b1116*#; \nStx:627\u00b1  8; LPS+Stx:2092 \u00b159*, *vs. Control, #vs Stx p<0,05). \nMoreover, LPS induced on iPSC-MSC an increment on the migra -\ntory capacity of these cells (percentage of migration Control: 44\u00b110; \nLPS:69\u00b111*; Stx: 42\u00b110; LPS+Stx: 72\u00b110, *vs. Control p<0,05) and \nadhesion to gelatin substrate (number of cells adhere to gelatin \nControl: 533\u00b137; LPS: 769\u00b1114*; Stx:702\u00b1102*; LPS+Stx:976\u00b1142, \n*vs. Control p<0,05). Finally, the addition of conditioned media of \niPSC-MSC treated with LPS+Stx to HMEC-1 (Human Microvascu -\nlar Endothelial Cells-1), decreased the capacity to close a wound \nin an endothelial monolayer (percentage of wound closure Control: \n38\u00b14; LPS:32\u00b14; Stx:24\u00b18; LPS+Stx: 18\u00b16*, *vs. Control p<0,05). \nIn conclusion, these results suggest that iPSC-MSC activated by \nLPS acquired a pro-inflammatory profile that induces migration and \nadhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, but the combination of both \ntoxin decreased the repair of endothelial damage. \n280.

In our region, common weeds, e.g. Salso -\nla kali , are one of the major causes of pollinosis. Murine models are \nuseful for studying the mechanism of allergic disease. Regarding the \nmodel antigen, the majority of studies have been performed using \novalbumin. The aim of this work were to develop an experimental \nanimal model of allergy based on relevant human aeroallergens, \nsuch as S. kali  pollen, and to define the immunological and cellu -\nlar airway features of the allergic response. BALB/c mice (n = 5/\ngroup) were administrated with PBS or S. kali  pollen extract through \ni.p. route and later challenged by nasal instillation of PBS or S. kali  \npollen respectively for 3 consecutive days. S. kali -specific IgE were \nmeasured by ELISA. After sacrifice, the noses and lungs were fixed \nand paraffin embedded for histological analysis (H&E, toluidine blue \nand periodic acid-Schiff). After nasal challenge with S. kali  pollen, \nsensitized mice manifested early-phase (sneezing) and late-phase \n(eosinophilic and basophilic accumulation) response compared with \nthe control group. Frequency of sneezing in sensitized mice were \nhigher than the control throughout the challenge phase (p < 0,01). \nThe histology showed goblet cell hyperplasia and eosinophil infiltra -\ntion in nasal lateral mucosa (135 \u00b1 58 in sensitized mice vs. 8 \u00b1 1 \nin control group) and septum (52 \u00b1 36 vs. 1 \u00b1 1 respectively). Also, \nsensitization induced moderate to severe inflammatory infiltration in \nlungs. S. kali -specific IgE value was not increased in all sensitized \nmice. Our results confirm upper airway inflammation correlated with \nlower airway inflammation in response to allergen exposure. The \nsymptoms and histology observed encourages us to think about the \nestablishment of an alternative murine model based on relevant hu -\nman allergens that allow to understanding the disease and exploring \ntherapeutic approaches.\n281.

Patients were classified into mild, mod -\nerate and severe according to WHO criteria. Each participant pro -\nvided written informed consent. Oncologic and vaccinated patients \nwere excluded from the study. Proportion of CD4+T Cells\u2013platelets \naggregates was measured by flow cytometry (CD4+CD62p+ cells). \nCD4+T cells were isolated from HD and cultured with platelets from \na single HD or a COVID19 patient (1:100 ratio). CD25 was evalu -\nated by flow cytometry and cytokine production was measured by \nELISA.\nWe observed a high frequency of CD4+ T cell-platelet aggregates \nin COVID19 (n=30-60, p<0.0001) that inversely correlated with \nlymphocyte counts (n=60, p=0.0267). Platelets from COVID19 but \nnot from HD inhibited the up-regulation of CD25 expression (n=7, \np=0.002) and TNF-\u03b1 production by CD4+T cells (n=7-13, p=0.0236). \nIFN-\u03b3 production was increased by platelets from HD but not from \nCOVID19 (n=19-33, p=0.0016). An available RNAseq from pu -\nrified platelets showed that COVID19 patients presented higher \nexpression of PD-L1 than HD (n=5-9, p=0.02), and the same was \nobserved by flow cytometry (n=26-30, p<0.0001). The proportion \nof PD-L1+platetelets inversely correlated with IFN-\u03b3 production by \nactivated CD4+T cells cocultured with platelets (n=43, p=0.0009). \nFurthermore, supporting a role for PD-L1 in the immunomodulatory \nactivity of platelets, we found that a blocking antibody directed to \nPD-L1 significantly restored COVID19 platelet-ability to stimulate \nIFN-\u03b3 production by CD4+T cells (n=12, p=0.005). Our study sug -\ngests that platelets might contribute to disease progression in se -\nvere COVID19 not only by promoting thrombotic and inflammatory \nevents, but also by suppressing T cell response.\n282.

Fundaci\u00f3n Tercer milenio\nSecretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is a serine protease \ninhibitor with pleitropic activities on immune and non-immune cells. \nLately, it has been proposed SLPI as a biomarker of acute kidney \ninjury with a protective role on tubular epithelial cells. The aim of the \npresent work was to unravel whether SLPI action on kidney is an \nimmune mediated effect. We found that the administration of SLPI \nreduced the kidney damage in a rat model of ischemia reperfusion \ninjury. However, SLPI was also able to reduce the damage in a gen -\ntamicin-induced nephrotoxicity rat model. In in vitro  experiments, the \nHK-2 human epithelial cells-treatment with SLPI reduced the cell \napoptosis induced by serum starving conditions or calcineurin in -\nhibitors. A real-time PCR array data with HK-2 cells revealed that \nSLPI modulated transcript levels of genes mainly involved in DNA \nrepair, response to misfolded proteins and inflammatory response \npathways. Furthermore, SLPI favors the proliferation and migration of HK-2 cells. In kidney transplant patients, plasma levels of SLPI \nwere high and indirectly associated with kidney function but also \nwith leukocyte proliferation index. However, the levels of SLPI tran -\nscripts found in the renal biopsies were indirectly associated with \nplasma creatinine and TGF b but directly associated with HMOX-1. \nAn indirect association was found between plasma levels of FK506 \nand SLPI. These results confirm that local SLPI exert a protective \nrole in kidney transplant patients which can be mediated directly \non epithelial cells and indirectly by affecting the immune response. \nFurthermore, it suggests that immunosuppression treatment can re -\nduce the expression of this nephropotective factor. \n283.

Peripheral blood \nsamples (PBMC) were taken before DAA (BSL) and 3-12 months \npost-treatment (3-12MPT). PBMC were incubated for 4 days with \npeptides spanning structural and non-structural (NS4a, NS5a and \nNS4b) HCV proteins. IFN-\u03b3 was measured in cell culture superna -\ntants by ELISA after stimulation. PD-1 expression on T-cells was \nevaluated by flow cytometry. Nonparametric tests were used for sta -\ntistical analysis.\nResults: Significant increments in the specific response to NS4a/\nNS4b (1,5\u00b13,6 vs 17,9\u00b117,2pg/ml, p=0,0039) and NS5a/NS4b an -\ntigens (1,0\u00b12,4 vs 8,6\u00b19,4pg/ml, p=0,0234) were observed only in \nF4 HIV/HCV between BSL and 3-12MPT. In both groups, absolute \nCD4+ T cell counts at BSL positively correlated with the magnitude \nof the specific response to structural proteins at BSL (p<0,0001, \nr=0,8006). PD-1 expression was higher in F4 than in F0/F1 group \nat BSL (36,1\u00b19,4% vs 48,8\u00b111,8%, p=0,0232) and 3-12MPT \n(35,3\u00b116,9%vs 50,3\u00b110,8%, p=0,0300). No differences in PD-1 \nwere observed after DAA treatment in either of the groups. \nConclusions: HCV-specific cellular response is improved after HCV \nviral clearance despite the lack of improvement in the immune ex -\nhaustion profile. This might be due to the elimination of HCV-antigen \nchronic stimulation, which would reduce the depletion of cells and \nallow the proliferation of specific cells upon re-stimulation in vitro. A \nbetter immunological status before DAA initiation correlates with a \nhigher recovery of specific cellular response.     \n284.

Since tonsils \nare the first barrier against airborne pathogens, we characterized \nthe T cell compartment obtained from hypertrophied tonsils in T21 \nchildren and age-matched controls (n=5 per group). We studied the \nfrequency of activated non-Tfh cells (CD3+ CD4+ CD45RA-CXCR5-ABSTRACTS165\nPD1+), Tregs (CD3+ CD4+ CD45RA-Foxp3+), pre-Tfh (CD3+ CD4+ \nCD45RA-CXCR5low PD1int) and Tfh (CD3+ CD4+ CD45RA-CXCR5hi \nPD1hi) by multiparametric flow cytometry. Also, the expression of \nCXCR3 (related to a Th1 profile) and the cytokines IL21, IFN\u03b3 and \nIL17 were analyzed. The frequencies of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, Tregs \nand CD19+ cells were not altered in T21 tonsils, but a diminution in \nKi67+ CXCR5+ CD19+ cells was observed (p<0.05). There is a 40% \nincrease in the fraction of activated non-Tfh cells (p<0.05) whereas \nthe ratio of Tfh decreases (p<0.3). There seems to be an arrest in \nthe pre-Tfh population which shows an increase in their proportion \n(p=0.08). Interestingly, a higher percentage of CXCR3+ pre-Tfh pop -\nulation (p<0.01) is observed. Moreover, the mean fluorescent inten -\nsity of CXCR3 is enhanced in all the T cell populations analyzed. \nWhen cytokines were studied, an increase in the fraction of Tfh \nIFN\u03b3+, IL21+ and IFN\u03b3+IL21+ was observed. To explore if dendritic \ncells (DC) could be involved in promoting a Th1 bias among the \nnon- and pre Tfh cells, we phenotypically analyzed the different DC \npopulation using the following markers (CD45, CD3, CD19, CD56, \nCD11c, HLADR, CD304, CD1c, CD141, CD86, Fc\u03b5RI, PDL1). No \nsignificant changes in the frequencies of the different DCs popu -\nlations were found. Our results suggest that T21 children have an \naltered tonsil T cell compartment, with a skewed Tfh differentiation \nand a Th1 profile among the pre-Tfh population. Further research \nshould be done to understand the mechanisms involved.\n285.

The aim of this study is to \nevaluate the association between HLA eMM and the development of \nbiopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR).\nPatients that received liver transplant between 2018 and 2020 \nwere included and prospectively followed for 9 months. Recipients \nand donor pairs were HLA typed by NGS and the number of eMM \nwas quantified. Risk loci for BPAR were identified by Cox regres -\nsion models. ROC analysis was performed to identify specific eMM \nthresholds for BPAR development and Kaplan-meier curves for the \nBPAR-free survival according to high or low eMM load were con -\nstructed.\nThirteen of our 37 patients included in the study developed BPAR \nduring follow up. The number of antibody verified (ab) eMM in \nHLA-A (HR: 1.10, CI95% 1.00-1.20; p= 0.045) and HLA-DQ (HR: \n1.21, CI95% 0.99-1.47; p= 0.063) were significantly associated with \nBPAR. Having \u2265 2 ab HLA-DQ eMM and \u2265 9 ab HLA-A eMM were \nconsidered as high loads. At 9 months post-transplant, the BPAR-\nfree survival for patients with low and high ab HLA-DQ eMM load \nwas 81.0% (CI95% 65.8-99.6) and 43.8% (CI95% 25.1-76.3), re -\nspectively, while for patients with low and high ab HLA-A eMM load \nwas 75.0% (CI95% 60.6-92.9) and 33.3% (CI95% 13.2-84.0), re -\nspectively.\nThe measurement of the ab eMM load for the loci HLA-A and HLA-\nDQ between donor and recipient prior liver transplantation could \nidentify those at risk of developing BPAR. Individualized immuno -\nsuppression protocols and closer surveillance could be performed if \nthe immunological risk is assessed precisely. Further studies in our \npopulation are being performed to confirm these results.\n286.

In this work, we aimed at studying the occurrence \nof a cytokine storm  in a cohort of COVID-19 patients (Cpts) from C\u00f3r -\ndoba (Argentine).  During first wave, we collected sera from individ -\nuals with RT-PCR+ for SARS-CoV2  hospitalized in Hospital Privado \nwith moderate (MOD) and severe (SEV)  disease (n=62, aged 21-80 \nyears) as well as healthy controls  (HC n=24, age matched), to deter -\nmine the concentrations of IL-1 b, IL-6,  IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-28A/B, \nIL-29, TNF, IP-10, IFN a2, IFN b, IFN g and GM-CSF by LEGEND -\nplexTM. Males represented 74%  of MOD and 67% of SEV Cpts. Hy -\npertension (HT, 48%), obesity (31%), dyslipidemia (DL, 24%), and \ndiabetes (24%) were the most frequent comorbidities. All cytokines, \nexcept IL-28A/B, were significantly increased in total Cpts in com -\nparison with HC (p<0.01). Elevated levels of IL-6 and CRP (p<0.01) \nbetween 4-7 day after hospitalization were found in all Cpts who \ndied, but the cytokine profiles were different in deceased SEV than \nin MOD Cpts. Mortality in SEV group was associated with high levels \nof IL-6 (p<0.001), GM-CSF (p<0.01), IL-8, CRP, leukocytosis and \ndecreased platelets (p<0.0001 for all).

Most of the patients were men (70%) aged between 60 and \n78 years. The 70% of patients had DM while 50% had arterial hy -\npertension. At d0, all the patients had increased neutrophils and in -\nflammatory markers (C reactive protein and D-dimers) and reduced \nnumbers of lymphocytes, HLA-DRhi monocytes, CD16+CD56+ NK \ncells, CD3+HLA-DR+CD25+ cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in blood. \nPatients received a standard treatment for COVID-19 care (O2, cor-\nticosteroids and antibiotics). The treatment normalized the levels of \nBIC (d5) in 30% of patients who were those with no comorbidities. In \npatients with DM, BIC recovery was variable. In DM patients who re -\nquired administration of plasma (30%), prolonged O2 therapy (40%) \nor referral to the intensive care unit (10%) significant reductions of \nCD16+CD56+, CD3+HLA-DR+CD25+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells were ob -\nserved between d0 and d5. In line with previous studies, our results \nshows that absolute counts of major lymphocyte subsets in blood \nare significantly and substantially decreased during the course of \nsevere COVID-19 disease in elderly patients. These BIC alterations \nmay persist despite clinical care in elderly patients with DM. Fur -\nther studies are needed to investigate the utility of early lymphocyte \nsubset measurements as prognostic biomarkers of disease severity, \nmortality, and response to treatment in COVID-19 elderly patients \nwith DM. \n288.

CDI has become a health security threat and a \nconsiderable challenge to public health worldwide. The increased \nincidence and the severity of disease have been linked to the emer -\ngence and fast spread of hypervirulent epidemic strains. Moreover, \na further increase in community-acquired infections and the zoonot -\nic potential of C. difficile  lead to a highly dynamic epidemiology of \nCDI. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA), a technique with high specificity \nbut low sensitivity, is widely used as a diagnostic tool for C. difficile  \nnowadays. To optimize the diagnosis and provide information for \nepidemiological surveillance strategies, the expression of glutamate \ndehydrogenase and toxin B (TcdB) of C. difficile  was determined \nby EIA, direct PCR of stool samples and colony PCR of anaerobic \nculture. We also conducted comparative analysis to determine the \nperformance of the direct PCR for C. difficile .\nFaecal samples from 81 hospitalized individuals with diarrhea were \ncollected. Clinical and demographic data were analyzed. We found \na frequency of 18.5% for toxigenic strains. Treatment with antibiotics \nor proton-pump inhibitors were the main risk factors for CDI present \nin our cohort. No differences were observed between CDI+ and CDI- \nindividuals for the aforementioned risk factors, nor comorbidities or \nage distribution. However, we did detect an increase in leukocytes, \nlymphocytes and monocytes counts in CDI patients (p<0.05).\nTo validate our direct PCR method we used the EIA as the refer -\nence test. Our results showed a sensitivity of 1.0 and a Negative \nPredictive Value of 0.85 compared to EIA. Although a larger number of samples is needed to validate the method and determine speci -\nficity, this technique could be a useful method for C. difficile  infection \nscreening.\n289.

Facultad de Ciencias \nQu\u00edmicas, UNC - CIBICI, CONICET\nTofacitinib (Tofa) is a Jak1/3 inhibitor that blocks the intracellular \nsignaling of inflammatory cytokines and is used as 3rd line of treat -\nment in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Tofa is very effective to achieve \ndisease remission but it is associated to higher incidence of her -\npes zoster reactivation likely due to alterations in cellular immunity. \nWhile several studies have evaluated on the effects of Tofa on the \nimmune system in the context of RA, knowledge about its impact \non the activation and differentiation of T lymphocytes (TL) is scarce. \nWe aimed to study this aspect in vivo and in vitro by determining the \nfunctional status of TL in different groups of treated RA patients (Tx \nRA) and the effect of Tofa in the activation of T cells from healthy \ndonors (HD), respectively. Thirty-one HD and 106 RA patients were \nrecruited in the Rheumatology Service (HNC) to evaluate numerous \nbiochemical and immunological parameters. Principal component \nanalysis showed that 82 of these variables explain around 70% of \nthe variance, with variables related to the activation and differentia -\ntion of TL as the main difference between HD and different groups \nof Tx RA. Compared to HD, Tofa Tx RA patients presented a signif -\nicant increase in the % of populations with terminal differentiation \ncharacteristics including CD27-CD28- of CD4+ TL (p <0.01) and \nKLRG1+CD57+ CD4+ and CD8+ TL (p<0,05). In addition, in vitro \nstudies showed that Tofa reduced the activation of purified CD4+ \nand CD8+ TL as evidenced by a decrease in the upregulation of \nCD25, T-bet and the frequency of Ki-67+ cells. These effect were a \ndose-dependent and observed in total, na\u00efve and, mainly, memory \nTL. Interestingly, Tofa increased the expression of senescent mark -\ner p21 in memory CD8+ TL. Altogether, our findings suggest that \nTofa-induced replicative immunosenescence could underlie the bio -\nlogical effects of this drug in RA and be also involved in side effects, \nrestraining the activity of memory TL involved in viral control.\n290.

We an -\nalyzed intra-articular microbiota components and their association \nwith immunopathogenic mechanisms of Spondyloarthritis (SpA). \nSynovial fluid (SF) of peripheral SpA patients were pooled (n=9): \n6 psoriatic arthritis, 2 reactive arthritis, 1 undifferentiated SpA (Pro -\ntocol approved CE002-2017). IL-17, IL-6, IL-23 and TGF- b levels \nwere quantified in each SF sample by ELISA and compared with \nSF from osteoarthritis (OA). Moreover, SW982 cells (human syno -\nvial fibroblasts) were incubated with the SpA SF pool in absence \nor presence of polymyxin B (LPS inhibitor) and 48 h later the IL-6 \nlevels in the supernatant were measured by ELISA. Furthermore, \nintestinal microbiota proteins were analyzed in the SpA SF pool \nthrough a Gel-LC bottom-up mass spectrometry-based proteomic \nstudy. Higher levels of IL-17, IL-6, IL-23 and TGF- b were detected in \nSpA compared with OA SF (p<0.001, p<0.01, p<0.001, and p<0.01, \nrespectively). Since segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) have a \ncardinal feature to induce Th17 cell differentiation in gut immunity, \nwe searched for SFB peptides in the SF of SpA. We found 54 pep -\ntides of SFB with abundance estimated with an exponentially modi -\nfied Protein Abundance Index (emPAI) from 0.01 to 0.28. In addition, \nLPS is present in synovial microenvironment of SpA since polymyxin \nB treatment significantly reduced IL-6 secretion by synovial fibro -\nblasts stimulated with SpA SF (p<0.05). Therefore, we explored the \nsynovial presence of peptides of microbiota Gram-negative bacteria, \nparticularly genus Dialister  because it was described as a potential \nintestinal microbial marker of disease activity in SpA. Accordingly, \nwe found 55 peptides of genus Dialister (emPAI 0.02-0.33). Our find -\nings show the presence of LPS and microbiota bacterial proteins in \nthe synovial microenvironment of peripheral SpA and suggest their \npotential association with immunopathogenic mechanisms of this \ninflammatory arthropathy.\n292.

She was treated as chronic \nurticaria, with poor response to anti-histaminics and NSAIDS.  \nAmbulatory evaluation by rheumatology and internal medicine \nshowed no association to autoimmune nor infectious disease. Lab -\noratory evaluation depicted elevated acute phase reactants: ESR, \nCRP, fibrinogen, platelets, ferritin, together with granulocyte \npredominant leukocytosis. MRI showed a mild splenomegaly with \nsmall scattered lymph nodes in abdomen and mediastine, which \nwere metabolically active in a PET-CT. \nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy were hypercellular, with normal \nphenotype. Lymph node biopsy depicted chronic lymphadenitis with \nfollicular hyperplasia, negative for neoplasia. Screening for PIDs \nwas negative. Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy showed normal \nfindings. \nInflammatory episodes continued lasting a few days to a week, with \nresponse to high dose steroids. Next generation sequencing for AIS \nand PID target genes was run (saliva sample, Illumina\u00a9 sequencing \nand Sanger, MLPA, MLPA-seq, Array CGH confirmation) and detect -\ned the NOD2 variant c.2104C>T (p.Arg702Trp).\nYAOS was diagnosed according to 2015 criteria, with the pa -\ntient fulfilling 2 major, three minor and the molecular criteria . \nShe is on moderate dose meprednisone regimen with good re -\nsponse to date. \nThis is the first description of a case of YAOS in Argentina.\n293.

T cells  could contribute to these different outcomes, but \nit remains unclear whether T cell response is dysfunctional or ex -\ncessive. Here, we evaluated  the phenotypic and functional features \nof circulating T cells from  a cohort of 40 COVID-19 patients (Cpts) \nwith moderate (MOD)  and severe (SEV) clinical disease (aged 21-\n80 years) and 14  aged matched healthy controls (HC) by FACS. All \nCpts exhibited  a reduced frequency of CD3+T and Tregs cells com -\npare to  HC (p< 0.05). When exhaustion was evaluated, SEV Cpts \nshowed  higher % of PD-1+ and CD39+ in T conv cells  (p<0.05), \nwhereas no differences were found in BTLA or TIGIT  expression. \nEven though, no differences in cytokine production (INF- \u03b3, IL-2  and \nTNF) were observed, T conv cells from SEV Cpts  showed a higher \n% of GZMB+ and CD107+ cells than  MOD Cpts or HC (p<0.05). Cir -\nculating CD8+ T cells express  different levels of CD8, where CD8lo \ncells represent highly activated cytotoxic T cells. COVID-19 patients \npresented a higher % of CD8lo T cells than controls and this in -\ncrement was  even more pronounced in SEV Cpts ( p=0.04, MD vs  \nHD; p=0.0012, SD vs HD). CD8lo T cells exhibited  impaired cytokine \nproduction and CD107a expression compared to CD8hi T cells, al -MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

CD8lo \npopulation from HC showed higher % of na\u00efve T cells  than effector \nmemory (EM)( p=0.04) or EMRA ( p=0.008) subsets, but this distribu -\ntion was not seen in MOD or SEV Cpts. Indeed, MOD or SEV Cpts \nshowed higher % of EM cells than HC.\nConclusion: the disease severity impacts on the phenotype and \nfunctional features of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with a pronounced \nincrement in the % of CD8lo T cells as the disease worsens. These \ncells appear  to have dysfunctional phenotype with an impairment \nof effector cytokines  production but maintaining cytotoxic potential. \nThe CD8hi/CD8lo ratio might be a useful parameter to predict the \ndisease outcome.\nMEDICINA REGENERATIVA Y TERAPIA CELULAR\n294.

CABA, Argentina.\nIntroduction  &  aims:  Hemarthroses  in  hemophilia  cause  chron -\nic hemophilic synovitis (CHS) and the  role of neutrophils infiltration \non the pathophysiology of CHS is  unknown. Neutrophils release ex -\ntracellular DNA  traps (ETs), structures containing DN A fibers and \nElastase,  which  are  associated  with  chronic  inflammation.  We  \naim  to  evaluate   the association of ETs with join damage in CHS, \nthe protective effect of platelet rich plasma (PRP) against ETs for -\nmation and after intraarticular injections in patients with CHS. Meth -\nods:  Synovial  Fluid  (SF),  PRP  and  platelet-poor  plasma  were  \nobtained  from  21 patients with CHS.  Joint damage was evaluated \nwith the Haemophilia Joint Health Score  and monthly bleeding ep -\nisodes. Synovial and plasmatic ETs were quantified  by fluorometry \n(DNA level), ELISA, and microscopy (DNA-Elastase complex) and  \ncorrelated with clinical parameters by Spearman\u2019s test.\nResults: Patients with CHS showed DNA level of 0.37\u00b10.06\u03bcg/\nml and DNA-Elastase of 0.27\u00b10.03OD in SF. Furthermore, the \nplasma of patients with CHS also showed significant DNA levels \n(0.17\u00b10.01\u03bcg/ml) and DNA-Elastase (0.16\u00b10.03DO) which positive -\nly correlated with the synovial level (r=0.7, p>0.05). ETs in plasma \nof healthy donors were undetectable. Correlations between syno -\nvial and plasma DNA-Elastase with joint damage parameters were \nsignificant (r=0-5-0.7;p<0.05). Moreover, incubation of SF with neu -\ntrophils resulted in the release of E Ts and this phenomenon was \nimpaired  by the presence of plasma or  PRP. Finally,   preliminary   \ndata   of  5  patients  with  CHS  showed  that  joint  damage  and  \nsynovial/plasma DNA-Elastase levels decreased afte r 1 month of \nreceiving PRP. Conclusion:  The  correlation  of  synovial/plasma  \nlevels  of  ETs  with  articular  damage suggests synovial ETs as \npotential biomarker and therapeutic target for CHS. The protective \neffect of plasma on reducing ETs formation could be attributed in  \npart to plasma DNAses as potential mechanism underlying the ther -\napeutic action of PRP in CHS.\n295.

They express embryonic stem cells markers, and \nthey are pluripotent. These characteristics position hAECs as ideal \ncandidates for regenerative medicine. Hepatic failure is one of the \nmajor causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The available \ntreatments have several obstacles. Recently, hAECs have been \nspotlighted as an alternative source of hepatocytes because of \ntheir potential for hepatogenic differentiation. The Wnt/beta-catenin \npathway is an evolutionarily conserved signalling cascade that is \nimportant for stem cell renewal, cell proliferation, and cell differenti -\nation, including hepatogenesis. This work aimed to assess the Wnt/\nbeta-catenin pathway participation during hepatic differentiation of \nhAECs. Previously, we have demonstrated that hAECs efficiently \ndifferentiate to hepatic-like cells, by applying a specific hepatic dif -\nferentiation (HD) protocol. We have found that HD medium signifi -\ncantly induced an increment in Wnt-1, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin \nexpression in hAECs, measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot. We \nhave also observed a significant increment in E-cadherin nuclear \nlocalization during hAECs HD, evaluated by immunofluorescence. \nMoreover, HD decreased GSK3-B expression. Treatment of hAECs \nwith XAV939 (a beta-catenin pathway inhibitor) caused the inhibition \nof HD, as albumin and CYP7A1 expression were reduced. Addition -\nally, beta-catenin pathway inhibition during HD, diminished the ex -\npression of miRNAs involved in liver development (mir-122, mir-221, \nand mir-194). These results suggest that the Wnt/beta-catenin path -\nway activation may be responsible for successful hepatic differentia -\ntion of hAECs. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating \nhepatocyte differentiation will significantly facilitate the development \nof stem cell-based therapy to treat liver diseases.\n296.

However, its correct vascularization \nremains a major challenge. We have shown that the presence of \ndermal papilla cells (DPCs) in these constructs favors the vascular -\nization process, resulting in a better wound healing and graft take. \nWe also have seen DPC-spheres culture increase the expression of \nangiogenic genes as VEGF, angiogenin and FGF. Since angiogen -\nesis in scaffolds is essential for grafts to survive and integrate with \nexisting host tissue, our aim was to compare the neovascularization \nabilty of monolayer and spheres cultures of DPC by using two adapt -\ned angiogenic models\nTo be able to compare the inductive molecules secretion between \nmonolayer and spheres, we looked for the condition in which both \nsystems contained the same amount of metabolically active cells. In \nour culture conditions, 45 spheres were metabolically equivalent to \n104 cells/cm2 monolayer seeded cells. \nWe observed that serum concentration is critical to sphere forma -\ntion, when generated by the hanging drop technique. As at least 5% \nwas required for DPC to aggregate, the same conditions were used \nfor monolayer culture, in order to compare the angiogenic effects. \nFor the migration assay, conditioned media by monolayer or spheres \nwere transferred to the bottom of a transwell plate and the HUVEC \nwere seeded on the insert and placed into wells. We obtained ~10% \nmore HUVEC cells migrated in the culture medium conditioned by \nthe spheres than in the culture medium conditioned by the mono -\nlayer.\nIn conclusion, three-dimensional culture of DPCs improved the mi -\ngration ability of HUCE in vitro . In this way, the use of DPC spheres \nin skin substitutes may favor the vascularization of the grafts, favor -\ning the closure of the wound and the graft take.\n297.

Stem cells \nderived from amniotic membrane offer considerable advantages \nover other stem cells because of the ease of collection, their low im -\nmunogenicity and minimal ethical and legal barriers are associated \nwith their use. Amniotic epithelial cells isolated from the amnion ex -\npress embryonic stem cells markers and are pluripotent. Not only are \namnion-derived stem cells applicable in regenerative medicine, but \nalso have antitumoral properties. Hepatic failure is one of the major \ncauses of morbidity and mortality. In particular, the hepatocarcinoma \nis the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. A few studies have \ndemonstrated the antitumoral effects of the amniotic membrane and \ntheir cells, but little is known about the molecular and cellular mech -\nanisms involved. The aim of this work was to analyze the expression \nof some important pro and antiapoptotic proteins, in hepatocarci -\nnoma cells treated with amniotic membrane conditioned medium \n(AM-CM). Previous results showed that AM-CM inhibits proliferation \nof HepG2 and HuH-7 cells. We have analyzed the expression of \nthe proapoptotic proteins Bax, Bad and Bak and the antiapoptotic \nproteins Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1, by qRT-PCR and Western blot, in \nHepG2 and HuH-7 hepatocarcinoma cells, treated with AM-CM. We \nobserved a significant increment in proapoptotic mRNAs and pro -\nteins expression and a decrease in antiapoptotic genes and proteins \nexpression, after 24 and 72 h of treatment with AM-CM. Moreover, \nAM-CM treatment increase the presence of apoptotic nucleus, mea -\nsured by DAPI staining. Our results position amnion-derived stem \ncells as emerging candidates in anticancer therapy.\n298.

In recent years biotechnological research \nwith MSCs has grown steadily based on the ability to integrate them \ninto damaged tissue and to immunomodulate the inflammatory re -\nsponse in vivo, helping in tissue regeneration. Here we evaluated \nthree-dimensional pieces with biocompatible materials containing \nMesenchymal Stem Cells, i) functionalizing a hydrogel-based bioink \nby adding to the formulation extracellular matrix proteins, iii) formu -\nlating a PEG-based bioink ii) evaluating  the viability and behavior of \nbioprinted MSCs over time post-printed in the ink variants.\nMSCs were obtained from the differentiation of Pluripotent Stem \nCells as previously reported. We added in different proportions, \nhyaluronic acid to the alginate-based bioink that we develop pre -\nviously. We also tested in different proportions PEGDA (Poly (eth -\nylene glycol) diacrylate) combined with a photoinitiator. The optimal \ncombination of the components was given by the evaluation of the \ninks based on its ability to: print pieces with good height; be steril -\nizable, without destroying its components; good swelling capacity, \nfor the correct distribution of oxygen and nutrients; and ability to \nmaintain cell viability. Cell viability was evaluated with the CellEvent \nCaspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent Kit. \nWe found that the combination of hyaluronic acid with alginate-based \nbioink increases post-print cell viability and we also found patches \nwith PEGDA did not modify cell viability significantly.\nIn conclusion, we found that the combination of hyaluronic acid \nwith alginate-based bioink improves the extracellular environment increasing cell viability and swelling of the patch. Our results also \nsuggest that PEGDA formulation is one more possible alternative \nfor our experiments.\n299. (369) SELECTIVE DECELLULARIZATION AND ENDO -\nTHELIAL REPLACEMENT AS A STRATEGY TO IMPROVE \nIMMUNOCOMPATIBILITY IN TRASPLANTED ORGANS \nGeraldine Haeublein1, Gabriela Lombardi1, Fiorella Caro1, \nDiego Guerrieri1, Domingo Casadei2, Eduardo Chuluyan1.\n1-Centro de Estudios Farmacol\u00f3gicos y Bot\u00e1nicos (CEFY -\nBO) UBA-CONICET, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de \nBuenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina. 2-Fundaci\u00f3n del \nTercer Milenio de Trasplante de \u00d3rganos y Tejidos, Buenos \nAires, Argentina.\nThe number of kidney transplants performed  each year cannot meet \nthe increasing demand of these organs. Several strategies aim to in -\ncreasing the offer of immune compatible organs,  such as xenotrans -\nplantation of genetically modified pig organs and the generation of \nbioartificial organs. Herein we described a new technique that allows \nus to generate a rat bioartificial kidney whose endothelial cells have \nbeen  replaced with human endothelial cells.\nTwo different protocols were used in order to maintain parenchyma \nepithelial cells and remove selectively rat endothelial cells. In the \nfirst one, 2ml of a  solution of 0.01% of SDS was perfused via renal \nartery at 4\u00b0C. For the second protocol, the rat kidney was perfused \nwith increasing osmolarity solutions of saccharose and EDTA at \nroom temperature for 15  minutes. The effectiveness of partial decel -\nlularization was calculated by comparing those endothelial cell de -\ncellularized kidneys with a kidney that has been decellularized with \ncollagenase (positive control). Albumin conjugated to Evans blue \ndye was  perfused through the artery in order to evaluate vascular \npermeability. Both protocols achieved a similar vascular permeabili -\nty while the second  group maintained a better epithelial cell viability \nassessed with TUNEL assay (65 % vs 40 %).\nAfterwards, partially decellularized kidneys were recellularized (2 \nhours at 37\u00b0C) with 7x106 human endothelial cells transfected with \nGFP protein. Histological analysis showed HMEC-GFP attached \nin almost all the vascular bed. Finally, recellularized kidneys were \ntransplanted in an anesthetized rat. After surgery, complete organ \nperfusion was achieved  and also urine production for at least 30 min \npos-transplant.\nThese results suggest that endothelial decellularization and recel -\nlularization with human  cells can be feasible methods in order to \ngenerate a more immune compatible bioartificial organs.\n300. (381) A CRITICAL PATHWAY IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: \nC19MC MICRORNAS REGULATES FGF2 RESPONSE IN A \nMODEL OF HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS CARDI -\nAC DIFFERENTIATION\nAlan Miqueas M\u00f6bbs, Ximena Garate, Maria Agustina Scara -\nfia, Carolina Colli, Natalia Lucia Moro, Carlos Luzzani, Ariel \nWaisman, Alejandro La Greca, Santiago Gabriel Miriuka\nLIAN-CONICET, Fleni, Sede Escobar, Ruta 9 Km 52.5. Bel\u00e9n \nde Escobar. Buenos Aires. Argentina.\nHuman pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) have the capacity to self-re -\nnew and differentiate in vitro  into all cell types of the organism, and \nit is an established model for early human embryo development. \nRecently, we found a 56-miRNA-cluster located at human chromo -\nsome 19 (C19MC) that downregulates during hPSC cardiac differ -\nentiation (CD). To ascertain the role of this primate-specific microR -\nNA cluster, a hPSC-C19MC(-/-) line was generated with CRISPR/\nCas9. C19MC(-/-) cells displayed no evident changes in the cell cycle, \napoptosis or differentiation markers compared to wild type. Contrari -\nly, C19MC(-/-) cells were significantly  impaired to differentiate into \ncardiomyocytes. Early mesoderm and cardiac RNA markers, like \nEOMES, TBX6, MESP1, were found altered. In order to further ex -\nplore the early steps of differentiation, we performed RNA-seq of the \ncells  at the gastrulation stage (0 and 24hs after CHIR99021 incuba -\ntion). Gene ontology analysis revealed altered signaling pathways, \nincluding PI3K-Akt, MAPK and Wnt, and FGF2. As FGF2 is a key \npathway in pluripotency, we address its role through two different MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021170\napproaches. First, both wild type and mutant cells were treated with \nFGF2 for 3 hours before gastrulation. Wild-type phenotype was part -\nly recovered, as evidenced by the presence of contractile cardiomy -\nocytes at day 15. Second, given that FGF2 is an important activator \nof RAS cascade that phosphorylates ERK1/2 (pERK), we incubated \nthe cells with FGF2 for up to 5 hs in pluripotency media. Mutant \ncells exhibited an elevated pERK mark in ground conditions, and it \nwas noticeable that the phosphorylation took place faster when they \nwere treated. In summary these findings support a critical role of the \nC19MC microRNA cluster in early stages of primate differentiation.\n301. (406) THE HSA-MIR-216/217 CLUSTER IS DIFFEREN -\nTIALLY EXPRESSED DURING HUMAN EMBRYONIC \nSTEM CELLS NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION\nRodr\u00edguez Varela MS1, Mucci S1, Isaja L1, Ferriol S1, Sevlever \nGE1, Scassa ME1, Romorini L1\n1. Laboratorio de Investigaciones Aplicadas a las Neurocien -\ncias \u2013 FLENI- CONICET\nHuman embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are self-renewing cells that \nhave the potential to differentiate into specialized cells. MicroRNAs \n(miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play important roles in \nmany key processes, such as cell differentiation. Large fraction of \nthem are key regulators throughout neural development. Due to this, \nwe aimed to identify and characterize miRNAs involved in hESCs \nneuronal differentiation. To this end, we derived and characterized \nneural stem cells (NSCs) from H9 hESCs and differentiated these \ncells into neurons (NEU). We next performed a high throughput small \nRNA sequencing of these cell populations followed by  bioinformat -\nics analysis. First, we select miRNAs with no less than 10 reads and \nvisualized them as a heat map to represent the miRNA expression \nprofile. Then, we carried out a differential expression analysis (FDR \n0.5) and found 728, 270 and 798 differentially expressed miRNAs \nbetween hESCs-NSCs; NSCs-NEU and hESCs-NEU, respectively. \nRNA-seq results were validated analyzing, by RT-qPCR with specific \nstem loop primers, expression levels of known miRNAs involved in \nneuronal differentiation (hsa-miR-9-3p/9-5p/124-3p/125a-5p/125b-\n5p and 128-3p). From the list of differentially expressed miRNAs \nit caught our attention the hsa-miR-216a,b/217 cluster, which was \nonly expressed in NSC and NEU. Moreover, this expression pat -\ntern was also validated by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, expression of \nthis cluster was reported in published RNA-Seq bioinformatic data -\nsets of other neural cell types but not along mesoderm and endo -\nderm differentiations or in other species or types of pluripotent stem \ncells datasets. Besides, there is no bibliographic data of this family \nassociated to neural differentiation or regulation of stemness. In a \nfuture, we aim to knock out the whole cluster using the CRISPR/\nCas9 technology as a loss-of-function strategy. This knowledge will \nenable us to characterize the function and targets of this cluster in \na neurogenic context.\n302.

Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas, Universidad Nacional de \nC\u00f3rdoba\nCells in living beings are disposed in three dimensions and, conse -\nquently, growing cells in 3D cultures are a more realistic, physiolog -\nically relevant than in a 2D environment, the last being the more ex -\ntended due to their ease of use. For tissue engineering, 3D cultures \ncan provide more representative information of the cell proliferation \nand differentiation capacity as well as a measure of the need of vas -\ncularization of the artificial tissue. Here, we explore the use of two \nhydrogels, alginate (ALG) and silk fibroin (SF) as scaffolds for 3D \ncultures of cells, making focus on soft gelation processes that avoid \ncompromising the cell viability. Alginate gelation was performed by \nCa2+ crosslinking,  which was tailored by the addition of Ca2+ con -\ntaining particles and pH control, while SF gelation was induced by sonication. Then, the rheological properties of the hydrogels con -\ntaining ALG and/or SF was evaluated. Finally, the proliferation and \ndifferentiation capacity of MC3T3-E1 Subclone 4 cells were ana -\nlyzed in both 2D and 3D environments. SF exhibited a more simple \nand customizable gelation procedure than ALG, although the latter \nshowed a more stable gel than the former. 3D cultures, although \nmore complicated to obtain, significantly changed the behavior of \ncells. Consequently, this type of culture is the more appropriate to \ndetermine the capacity of these hydrogels to perform as scaffolds for \nbone tissue engineering.\n303. (411) MESENCHYMAL STEM CELL-DERIVED EXOSOMES \nLOSE THEIR REGENERATIVE POTENTIAL UPON UV-C \nIRRADIATION\nMar\u00eda Celeste Biani, Antonella Lombardi, Alejandro La Gre -\nca, Luc\u00eda Moro, Ariel Waisman, Santiago Gabriel Miriuka, \nCarlos Daniel Luzzani.\nLaboratorio de Investigaci\u00f3n Aplicada a la Neurociencia, \nFLENI - CONICET.\nExosomes are extracellular vesicles ranging from 30  nm to 150 nm \nthat originate from the endosomal pathway.  Their content will de -\npend on the cell of origin and  its physiological state, thus the mes -\nsage they convey might change  in response to changes in cellular \nconditions. In particular, the  DNA damage response (DDR) has been \nreported to modulate exosome  secretion. This work aims to eluci -\ndate the effect that genomic  damage induced by UV-C may have on \nthe exosomal secretion of Mesenchymal Stem Cells derived from \ninduced Pluripotent Stem cells (iPS-MSC).\nTo induce genomic stress, iPS-MSC were irradiated with three dif -\nferent UV-C intensities (0,001 J/cm2 , 0,01 J/cm2 and 0,1 J/cm2) \nand it was  assessed by immunofluorescence evidencing the ex -\npression of damage sensors such as S-15 phosphorylated p53 and \nH2AX-\ud835\udec4. Our group has previously demonstrated that although  both \nthe expression of genes involved in the exosomal pathway and the  \nnumber of exosomes   secreted by irradiated and non-irradiated iPS-\nMSC did  not show a significant difference  between conditions, a \nloss in pro-migratory  properties was observed in irradiated  iPS-\nMSC derived exosomes. For this reason, we hypothesized that a \nchange in exosomal   cargo could be responsible for such effects. \nTo evaluate this,  exosomes secreted by irradiated and not irradiated \nIPS-MSC were isolated   from  conditioned  media  using  a   Size \nExclusion Chromatography column and proteomic analysis was per -\nformed by Tandem Mass Spectrometry. The results showed that  a \nsubset of cytoskeleton proteins and migration-inhibiting molecules \nwere over-represented in exosomes from irradiated cells,   such  as  \nFilamin  A  and  Talin-1,  known  for  negatively regulating cell motility.\nAltogether these results suggest that iPS-MSC irradiated exosomes \ncarry a distinct and particular cargo that can explain the reverting of \nthe pro-migratory capabilities of non-irradiated iPS-MSC exosomes.\n304. (414) EFFICIENCY OF POINT MUTATION BY CRISPR/\nCAS9 IN IPSCS DETERMINED BY NEXT GENERATION \nSEQUENCING\nAmin Guadalupe, Casta\u00f1eda Sheila Lucia, Mobbs Alan Mi -\nqueas, Scarafia Agustina, La Greca Alejando, Waisman Ariel, \nAtorrasagasti Catalina, Miriuka Santiago Gabriel, Moro Lucia \nNatalia\nThe arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a genetic disease \ncharacterized by the replacement of contractile myocardium by \nadipose tissue, causing ventricular arrhythmias and eventually sud -\nden death in patients. One of the most commonly mutated genes \nis the Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) that codifies for a desmosomal protein. \nThe aim of this work was to  generate an induced pluripotent stem \ncell (iPSCs) line with a reported point mutation in PKP2 gene (C>T \nthat generates a missense mutation p.S140F) by CRISPR/Cas9 for \nmodeling the ACM in vitro. In order to generate this edition we de -\nsigned two RNA guides (gRNA 1 and 2) targeting the Cas9 to the \ndesired region of the PKP2 gene and a template DNA for each gRNA \n(ssODN 1 and 2) complementary to the sequence containing the \npoint edition. We co-transfected the plasmid containing the CRISPR \nsystem with gRNA1 orABSTRACTS171\ngRNA2 together  with the ssODN1 or ssODN2, respectively, to 2x10\u2075 \niPSCs in two different\nconcentrations (1 ug or 2.5 ug of each DNA construction): gRNA1-1, \ngRNA1-2.5, gRNA2-1, gRNA2-2.5 groups. After puromycin selec -\ntion, genomic samples from the 4 groups were taken for amplicon \nsequencing analysis. PCR amplicons from the pool were sequenced \nusing Miseq in CD-Genomics.  These results were analysed with \nCRIS.py, a python-based program for multiple sequence analysis. \nThe analysis revealed 24.7%, 27.6%, 0.2% and 5.5% of C>T edition, \n9%, 10.9%, 3.2%, 25.7% of indel, and 67.8%, 62.9%, 91.2% and \n47% of wild type sequences for gRNA1-1, gRNA1-2.5, gRNA2-1, \ngRNA2-2.5, respectively.\nWith these results, cells from gRNA1-1 were clonally expanded and \n15 clonal cell lines were Sanger sequenced, obtaining 3 clonal cell \nlines with the desired edition (20%).\nIn conclusion, gRNA1 was more efficient than gRNA2 independently \nof the DNA concentration used. Our next steps are to characterize \nthe phenotype of the C>T PKP2 clonal cell lines and to determine \nwhether we can model the ACM in-vitro after differentiating these \ncell lines into cardiomyocytes.\n305.

Rapid  lung dissemination and acquired chemother -\napy resistance remain as major clinical challenges. Mesenchymal \nstem cells (MSC) may contribute directly or indirectly to OS origin \nand  progression. To identify potential metastasis biomarkers, we  \nmade  a proteomic screening of non-metastatic SAOS2, metastatic \nLM7 OS cells and BM-MSC using a shotgun approach by a  tan-\ndem nanocapillary liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry sys -\ntem. We identified 1049 proteins  for BM-MSC, 1567 for SAOS2, \nand 1424 for LM7. To obtain gene ontology terms of the identified \nproteins, an enrichment analysis of the gene groups was carried \nout. The three cell populations shared 661 proteins corresponding \nto protein metabolism, metabolism, and energy-related pathways \n(25.72%, 22.37%, and 22.37% respectively). Individually, SAOS2 \nand LM7 cells  showed the same number of shared proteins with \nBM-MSC, but  the 64-shared proteins were not the same. Most rel -\nevant differences  were that VEGF and PDGF signaling pathways \nwere 2.25 fold-increased  in LM7-MSC vs. SAOS2-MSC shared \nproteins. Further, citric acid and  electron transport pathways were \nupregulated in SAOS2-MSC shared proteins. A  comparison be -\ntween SAOS2 and LM7 also shows upregulation of VEGF/PDGF  \nsignaling and other metastatic-related pathways in LM7 cells. Our \nresults on  the comparison of both OS cells to MSC, suggest that \nMSC may  have a relevant role in OS progression, dictating not only  \ntumor initiation but also metastatic dissemination. Further, LM7 cells \nhad higher expression levels of proteins related to a mesenchymal \nphenotype  and stem-related genes, suggesting a closer relation with \nMSC. Lung  disease remains a major mortality factor in OS. Identifi -\ncation of mechanisms and differentially expressed genes associated \nwith metastasis would help in  discovering promising markers and \ntherapeutic targets.\n306.

These events can be linear (trans-splicing)  or \ncircular (circRNA) and both are post-transcriptional events. In hu -\nman pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), NCLe were described to con -\ntribute to  the regulation of early lineage differentiation; in particular \ncircRNAs formed  by quaking protein (QKI) 5 were described as nec -\nessary for  cardiac differentiation. Trans-splicing events are formed \nby separate pre-mRNA with  inverted and repeated sequences (Alu) \nwhile circRNA originate from a  backspliced junction in a pre-mRNA. \nThe aim of this work  was to characterize NCLe and the role of QKI \n5/6/7  in circRNA formation in iPSC. RNAseq data from an iPSC  line \nwas analyzed with NCLscan pipeline, revealing 1109 NCLe, among  \nwhich 3 occurred between different genes. To validate these inter -\ngenic  junctional events, we amplified them by RTq-PCR with specif -\nic primers  and sequenced the product, corroborating that these al -\nternative junctional organizations  were not informatic artifacts. PCR \non purified DNA showed they  are not genomic rearrangements. Fur -\nthermore, using magnetic oligo dT beads  we also demonstrated that \nthe 3 events are polyadenylated and they are sensitive to degrada -\ntion with RNase R, thus linearly conformed. In parallel, we designed \nRNA guides to knock out QKI in FN2.1 and H9 using CRISPR/Cas9. \nPCR and immunofluorescence analysis revealed the absence of the \ntarget, indicating that the strategy was successful. In conclusion, \nwe identified NCLe in an iPSC line and characterized 3 different \ntrans-splicing. We were also successful in preparing knockout lines \nfor QKI to assess its role in differentiation as well as the circRNAs \ndependent on its function. In the future we plan to assess these \nknockout lines by RNAseq and functionality of the trans-splicing with \nCRISPR/Cas13 and characterize using northern blot.\nMETABOLISMO Y NUTRICI\u00d3N\n307.

Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been described as a \nhistological manifestation of metabolic syndrome (MS). Mesenteric \nfat that drains into the portal circulation is the largest contributor to \nvisceral adiposity. There is great interest in the pleiotropic effects of \nmetformin (M) and losartan (L) in the treatment of risk factors for MS.\nWe studied the effects of M (500 mg/kg/day) and L (30 mg/kg/\nday) on NAFLD and its relationship with mesenteric vascular bed \n(MVB) adiposity, insulin resistance (IR) and systolic blood pressure \n(SBP) in an experimental model of MS for 9 weeks. Six groups of \nSprague-Dawley rats were used: control (C, standard diet), high-\nfat plus fructose-overload (HFF, 50% w/w bovine fat plus 10% w/v \nfructose solution), M-treated (CM), L-treated (CL), M-treated HFF \ndiet (HFFM) and L-treated HFF diet (HFFL). Adiposity index was \ncalculated as MVB adipose tissue weight/body weight x 100. Ho -\nmeostasis model of assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), SBP, hepatic ste -\natosis and perivascular fibrosis (hematoxylin-eosin and Sirius Red \ntechniques) were measured. \nHFF diet produced significant (p<0.001) increments on MVB adipos -\nity index (%, 1.75\u00b10.07 vs C: 0.81\u00b10.04), HOMA-IR (0.50\u00b10.06 vs MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Interest in the beneficial \neffects of Cannabis sativa L. has increased in recent years. Canna -\nbinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) \nhave been found to be potent antioxidants. The aim of this study was \nto evaluate the effects of cannabis oil on liver injury and oxidative \nstress in insulin-resistant dyslipidemic rats fed a sucrose-rich diet \n(SRD). Male Wistar rats were fed the following diets for 21 days: \nReference Diet (RD): standard commercial laboratory diet, Sucrose \nrich diet (SRD) and SRD+Cannabis oil (SRD+Ca): the oral admin -\nistration of 1 mg/kg of body weight of cannabis oil daily. The can -\nnabis oil presented a ratio of total cannabinoids THC:CBD of 1:2. \nWe analized: a) Serum:  triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, trans -\naminases (AST and ALT), alkaline phosphatase (AP) and non-en -\nzymatic antioxidant capacity (FRAP). b) liver: triglyceride content, \ntransaminases AST and ALT, AP, reactive oxygen species (ROS), \nsubstances reactive to thiobarbituric acid (TBARS), FRAP and Cat -\nalase activity. Results: In the SRD+Ca group, serum triglyceride and \ncholesterol levels decreased significantly, reaching similar values   to \nthe RD group, without changes in glucose levels. In addition, AST, \nALT, AP and TBARS levels were decreased (P<0.05), reaching ref -\nerence values. FRAP was increased (P<0.05), reaching reference \nvalues. In liver tissue, triglyceride content and AST, ALT and AP \nwere decreased (P<0.05). TBARS and ROS levels were reduced \n(P<0.05), reaching values   similar to RD group. In addition, FRAP \nand the activity of the enzyme Catalase was increased (P<0.05), \nalthough the values of the latter were still lower than RD group. In \nsummary, this work show that cannabis oil improves liver damage \nand oxidative stress in SRD-fed insulin-resistant dyslipidemic rats. \nTherefore, it would have a hepatoprotective effect on metabolic dis -\norders included in MS.\n312.

This study aimed to explore the effect of chia seed \nupon key enzymes of lipolysis, AKT levels and morphological chang -\nes of visceral adipose tissues in sucrose-rich diet- fed rats, a widely \nrecognized model of visceral adiposity and insulin resistance. Male \nWistar rats were fed a sucrose rich diet (SRD) for 3 months. Half \nof the animals continued with the SRD until month 6, the other half \nwas fed a SRD in which the fat source, corn oil (CO), was replaced \nby whole chia seed from month 3 to 6 (SRD+CHIA). Another group \nconsumed a reference diet all the time. We analyzed in epididymal \n(eAT) and retroperitoneal adipose tissues (rAT): a- morphological \nchanges (adipocyte size, collagen deposition and inflammatory cells \ninfiltration), b- lipolytic enzymes: HSL and ATGL levels; c- total and \npAKT levels (basal and post insulin stimulation -euglycemic hyper -\ninsulinemic clamp-). Besides, serum levels of triglycerides, free fatty \nacids, glucose, and insulin were determined. The replacement of \nCO by chia seed in the SRD: a- reduces adipocytes hypertrophy, \nlipid content and collagen deposition in both eAT and rAT (p<0.05), \nb- reduces the inflammatory cells infiltration in the eAT, c- decreases \nHSL and ATGL protein levels in eAT and HSL protein level in rAT \n(p<0.05); d- increases basal pAKT levels in eAT and improves the \ninsulin response of pAKT in both tissues (p<0.05). No differences \nin total AKT were observed between the 3 dietary groups, e-serum \nlevels of lipids and glucose were reduced. This work provides novel \ninformation about the mechanisms involved in the beneficial effect \nof chia seed in different deposits of adipose tissue.\n314.

Universidad de Buenos Aires, CONICET, Facultad de Far -\nmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Buenos Aires, Argentina\nTogether with the widely known cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk \nfactors, scientific community still look for new ones. Epicardial adi -\npose tissue (EAT) is a visceral adipose tissue surrounding myocardi -\num and coronary arteries, proposed to be an independent risk factor \nfor CVD. The lipidomic study of tissues reveals the role of many bio -\nactive lipids such as ceramides (Cer) on their metabolism. In EAT, \nthese lipids may contribute to CVD risk. We previously demonstrat -\ned that Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) activity is increased in EAT from \ncoronary patients (CAD), probably contributing to an increase in its \nvolume and therefore in CVD. We assessed the lipidome of EAT \nfrom CAD as well, demonstrating an enrichment in Cer. In this op -\nportunity, our aim was to evaluate links among EAT LPL, its inhibitor \nAngiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4), its activator glycosylphos -\nphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein-1 \n(GPIHBP1), and Cer content in the tissue.\nMethods and results: in EAT and subcutaneous AT (SAT) \nfrom CAD undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (n=25) or valve replacement (No CAD,n=14), LPL activity, ANGPTL4 \nand GPIHBP1 levels were evaluated by a radiometric as -\nsay and western blot, respectively. Tissue lipidomes were \nevaluated by UHPLC-MS, in positive and negative ionization \nmodes. For statistics, the MetaboAnalyst software was used.  \nIn EAT, we found an increase in LPL activity, directly associated with \ntotal Cer content (p= 0.002), being the strongest correlation with \nCer d18:1/24:1 (p<0.0001). Furthermore, Cer content inversely cor -\nrelated with ANGPTL4 ( p=0.04), but not with GPIHBP1 (p=0.26), \nalthough its levels were higher. In EAT, LPL activity was also asso -\nciated with short and long chain triglycerides, diglycerides and plas -\nmalogens. No associations were observed in SAT. \nConclusion: as a first approach, we propose that the increase in Cer, \nin particular d18:1/24:1, might be one mediator in the increase of \nLPL activity, contributing to CVD risk. \n316.

However, it is unknown whether the bioactive proper -\nties remain in vivo . The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect \nof dietary intake of microcapsules containing BSG peptides upon \nbiometric parameters and lipid metabolism disorders in an exper -\nimental model of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Male Wistar \nrats were fed from weaning (3-week old) and for 100 days with 1 \nof 3 randomly assigned experimental diets: a-Control group (C) re -\nceived a standard commercial rodent diet, b- SRD group received \na sucrose-rich diet (SRD), c- SRD+P group was fed with a SRD \ncontaining 700 mg/kg body weight/day of BSG protein hydrolysate \nmicroencapsulated.

ABSTRACTS175\nDietary lipids play an important role in bone health, which is rele -\nvant to develop effective interventions to prevent bone diseases or \ndisorders, especially during the period of growth.The present study \nevaluated the effects of feeding growing rats with a diet containing \nfried sunflower oil, on morphometric properties and biomechanical \ncompetence of the mandible. Methods : Male Wistar rats (21\u00b11 \ndays old) (n=21) were assigned to one of three diet groups: those \nfed a control diet (C), and a high-fat diet containing either sunflow -\ner oil (SFO) or  SFO which was repeatedly heated (SFOx). Total \nbody weight and food intake were weekly recorded. After 8 weeks, \nrats were euthanized. Mandibular growth was estimated with dig -\nital calipers on removed bones by taking measurements between \nanatomical points. Structural properties (load at fracture(Wf), load \nat yield(Wy), and stiffness(Wydy)), were determined by using a \nthree-point bending test (Instrom 4442). Results (mean\u00b1SD, ANO -\nVA-SNK): final body weight was lower in SFOx rats as compared \nwith C and SFO groups (310.0\u00b114.7g<339.4\u00b116.6g=336.4\u00b123.0g, \nrespectively; P<0.05). Mandibular weight and length (P=0.001) were \nnegatively affected by high-fat diets rich-SFOx.The deleterious effect \nof SFOx on mandibular growth was more accentuated on the pos -\nterior part (C:11.4\u00b10.3mm= SFO:11.1\u00b10.2mm >SFOx:10.7\u00b10.2mm; \nP=0.0005). The anterior/posterior ratio indicates that SFOx induced \nsome deformation of the mandible. Structural properties, Wf, Wy \nand Wydy of the mandible were negatively affected in rats fed \nSFO either fresh or fried, as compared to the C group (P<0.01). \nAlthough Wf and Wy did not show significant differences between \nSFO and SFOx groups, fried oil intake induced a significant reduc -\ntion in bone stiffness (Wy/dy). Conclusion:  The potential adverse \neffects of consuming SFOx may affect mandibular mass, growth \nand development. Awarded by UBACyT: 20020170100138BA & \n20020170200055BA.\n318.

In this study, \nwe evaluated the effect of SFOx diet on body fat content, visceral \nfat, hepato-somatic index (HSI) and liver fatty acids (FA) profile of \ngrowing rats.\nMale weaning Wistar rats (n=21) were randomly assigned to feed -\nings of one of three different diets. The control rats were fed a \ncommercial diet (C) and the experimental rats received either SFO \nor SFOx diets. SFO was repeatedly heated for a total of 40 hours \n(SFOx). SFO and SFOx were mixed with commercial rat chow. Rats \nwere fed ad libitum throughout the experiment. Total body weight \nand food consumption were recorded every other day. At eight-week \nexperimental period, body fat content and visceral fat were mea -\nsured; HSI and liver FA profile (GC,Testo Equipment, Model 270 at \n50\u00baC) were determined. Results. SFOx vs. SFO and C showed that \ntotal body weight (323.1\u00b19.1< 335.5\u00b110.9=337.7\u00b18.9 g; p=0.044), % \nbody fat (13.7\u00b10.8b vs.15.9\u00b11.7cvs.10.2\u00b11.3a; p=0.001); % visceral \nfat (3.55\u00b10.36>3.08\u00b10.38> 2.55\u00b10.33; p=0.008) and HSI (4.17\u00b10.34 \nvs. 3.64\u00b10.27 =3.66\u00b1; p=0.016) were altered. In SFOx rats, serum \nT-Chol and nonHDL-Chol were the highest (p=0.025 and 0.029, re -\nspectively). SFO, SFOx and C groups attained similar serum con -\ncentrations of triglycerides and HDL-Chol (P=0.057 and P=0.265, \nrespectively). There were significant higher liver profile of total sat -\nurated fatty acids; trans  FA and unidentified minor compounds in \nSFOx group (p=0.001, p=0.001 and p=0.025; respectively); mean -\nwhile, SFOx group presented significantly lower in total PUFA (p= 0.001) and MUFA (p=0.001) than SFO and C groups. Conclusions. \nThe potential adverse effects of SFOx denoted the risk for liver dys -\nfunction.

Argentina.\nThere is evidence that lipid and bone metabolisms are mutually \nregulated. Previously, we had demonstrated the negative effect \nof high-cholesterol diet(HCD) on bone health. Simvastatin(SMV) \nblocks cholesterol(chol) biosynthesis in hepatic cells. However, \nthe overall benefits observed with SMV appear to be greater than \nchanges in lipid levels. Indeed, recent studies indicate that statins \nhave beneficial extrahepatic effects. This study evaluated the effects \nof SMV administration on liver and bone under a hypercholesterol -\nemic diet consumption. Methods : 40 rats were assigned to 1 of 4 \ngroups: 1) control(C): fed pellets; 2) fed HCD; 3)C+SMV, fed pellets \nand SMV was given by gavage(5mg/day); and 4)HCD+SMV. After \n5 weeks, rats were euthanized, blood was drawn and chol (mg/dL) \nand transaminase activities [AST,ALT(UI/l)] were determined. The \nliver was removed and weighed. The hepato-somatic index (HSI% \n(organ mass(g)/body mass(g)%)) and  Oxidation of 2\u2032,7\u2032 dichloro -\nfluorescein diacetate(DCFH-DA)levels(spectrofluorimetry,u.a./min.\nmg.prot) were calculated. Structural properties of the femur (load \nat fracture(Wf), load at yield(Wy), diaphyseal stiffness(Wydy)), were \ndetermined (Instrom 4442). \nResults (mean\u00b1SD,ANOVA-SNK): SMV did not reduce chol \n(C:63.2\u00b11.1 = C+SMV:67\u00b116.8 < HCD+SMV:214.8\u00b131.2 \n= HCD:209.3\u00b139.3mg/dL, p<0.001) but improve transami -\nnase activity (p<0.001).

A historical control group \n(GH) was established with anthropometric data from older children \nwho did not experience ASPO between 6 and 9 years old.\nResults: 140 children were evaluated. Body weight increased during \nthe ASPO (DzBMI/age: 0.47 vs GH=0.04; p<0.001). Children report -\ned less physical activity (52.3%), increased screen time (75%) and \nsleeping more hours (46.6%) than before the ASPO. Children with \npre-existing overweight/obesity gained more weight (6.25 vs 3.0 kg \nin normal weight children; p<0.001), associated with reduced phys -\nical activity (2 h/day vs 3 h/day in normal weight children; p<0.001) \nand not to changes in diet.\nConclusion: ASPO affected lifestyle and weight gain in children; \nthose with pre-existing overweight/obesity were more affected.

Buenos Aires. Argentina.\n3 Laboratorio Central Hospital Oscar Alende, Mar del Plata, \nArgentina  \nCeliac disease (CD) occurs in 1 out of 167 adults in our country. The \nimmune response due to the ingestion of gluten produces injury to \nthe small intestine with an increase of oxidative stress markers. The \nonly treatment is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Many studies propose \nthat antioxidants contained in some foods contribute to prevention \nand improvement of some diseases. Objective : to determine the \ncontribution of antioxidants from the diet in celiac and non-celiac \npatients. Materials and Methods : 68 people were surveyed using \nGoogle Forms as a tool where the frequency and quantity of food \nwere recorded. The estimations of the total antioxidant capacity \n(TAC) were carried out with the intake data of these foods and the \ntabulated TAC values (umol TE / g of food) in previous publications. \nResults : It was found that 31% of the participants did not consume \nnuts or almonds. Within the group of vegetables, the most con -\nsumed were potatoes (71%), onions (64%) and tomatoes (59%). \nTangerine, banana, almond, potato and tomato showed statistical -\nly significant differences between the average consumed by celiac \npeople and controls (p <0.05, 95% confidence), finding the high -\nest intake in the celiac group. 81% of the total have a consumption \ngreater than 10,000 trolox (umol TE / day, recommended intake \naccording to bibliography). It was observed that 25% out of the 8 \npatients who consumed less than the recommended amount of an -\ntioxidants were celiac patients (12.5% did not adhere to the GFD). \nMean mate ingestion contributed to 35.8% and 28.6% of the total \nantioxidants intake from the foods surveyed in celiac patients and \ncontrols, respectively. There were no statistically significant differ -\nences in the contribution (%) of mate\u2019s TAC between the two groups \n(p = 0.3308, > 0.05). Conclusions : most of the surveyed people \nshowed an adequate antioxidant ingestion. Mate was identified as \nthe main source of TAC.

Therefore, we aimed to study the \nprotein expression of AdipoR1, AdipoR2, AMPK, CPT1 and ACOX1 \nin ovarian follicular structures during the development of follicular \npersistence in cows. Non-lactating Holstein cows (n=25) with regu -\nlar estrous cycles without previous reproductive disease were stud -\nied. The persistence model was performed with an intravaginal pro -\ngesterone device to get subluteal concentrations of progesterone, \nobtaining dominant follicles by ovariectomy at the expected day of \novulation (n=5; P0) and follicles that persist for 5 (n=5; P5), 10 (n=5; \nP10) or 15 days (n=5; P15) relative to the expected time of ovula -\ntion. Controls cows, without progesterone treatment, were ovariec -\ntomized in proestrus (n=5; C). Expression of target protein was as -\nsessed by indirect immunohistochemistry in ovarian tissue sections. \nIn theca cells, AdipoR1 expression was higher in persistent follicles \nof P15 than persistent/dominant follicles of other groups (p<0.05). \nAdipoR2 expression in theca cells was higher in persistent follicles \nof P15 than follicles of groups C and P0 (p<0.05). AMPK expression \ntends to increase (p=0.078) in the granulosa cells of the persistent \nfollicles of the P15 group with respect to persistent/dominant follicles \nof the other groups. In granulosa cells, the expression of CPT1 was \nhigher in persistent follicles of P5, P10 and P15 groups than C and \nP0 groups (p<0,05). In theca cells, the expression was higher in per -\nsistent follicles of P15 than C, P0 and P5 groups (p<0.05). ACOX1 \nexpression showed no differences (p>0.05) in follicular structures \nanalyzed. These results evidence a local alteration in some meta -\nbolic sensors from the initial stages of persistence, possibly related \nto alterations in the oxidation of fatty acids at intraovarian level.\n323.

Our aim was to evaluate the association be -\ntween different components of the lipid profile, particularly the TG/\nHDL-Cholesterol index as surrogate marker of IR and Remnants \nlipoproteins-cholesterol (RLP-C), in patients with COVID \u201019 at hos -\npitalization. Methods and results: 193 patients (68 (29-96) years; \n49.7% male) hospitalized for COVID-19 and 200 negative COVID-19 \npatients (46 (18-79) years; 52.5% male) consecutively attended at \nHospital de Cl\u00ednicas during the same period, were included.  Lipo -\nprotein profile and glucose were assessed in patients and controls. \nProcalcitonin (PCT), as a surrogate marker of COVID-19 severity, \nwas measured in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients were older \n(p<0.001), without differences in DM frequency (21% in both) neither ABSTRACTS177\nin gender between groups. COVID-19 patients presented higher glu -\ncose and TG, but lower total, LDL, HDL and no-HDL-Cholesterol lev -\nels (p<0.001) than controls. RLP-C and TG/HDL-Cholesterol were \nincreased in COVID-19 (p<0.001). Regarding PCT, the population \nwas divided by terciles: 0.010-0.070 ng/ml (n=46), 0.071-0.390 ng/\nml (n=60) and higher than 0.391 ng/ml (n=54). Using Kruskal Wal -\nlis test, no differences in age, gender and DM were observed. As \nthe PCT values rises, a decrease in total, LDL and HDL Cholesterol \n(p<0.03) was observed with no differences in TG, meanwhile levels \nof RLP-C and TG/HDL-Cholesterol increased (p<0.001). Conclu -\nsion: Lower levels of all the Cholesterol fractions were related with \nthe presence and severity of COVID-19. The increase in RLP-C and \nTG/HDL-Cholesterol index would indicate in COVID-19 patients a \nlipid metabolic disorder characteristic of IR states. \n324.

The \nMTP inhibitor lomitapide binds directly to MTP inhibiting the synthe -\nsis of VLDL in the liver. The objective of this work was to study the \neffect of MTP inhibition on tumor growth. Adult male Balb/c nude \nmice were subjected to a xenograft model where Huh7 cells (5x106/\nmouse) were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of mice. Af -\nter 4 days, mice were divided into 2 groups. Control group received \nvehicle (methylcellulose, gavage) and another group received 5 mg/\nkg bw/day lomitapide (gavage) for 15 days. Tumors were monitored \nusing a caliper and volumes were estimated based on the formula \n\u201c1/2 x l x w x h\u201d. At the end, mice were sacrificed, and tumors excised \nand weighed. Lomitapide-treated mice showed higher tumor volume \nand weight (2-fold) than control mice. Plasma levels of triacylglycer -\nol and cholesterol were decreased (-30%, and -40%, respectively) \nin lomitapide-treated mice compared to control mice. Tumor histol -\nogy showed no differences between groups on tissue architecture; \nhowever, lomitapide-treated mice presented with accumulation of \ncytosolic lipid droplets. Analysis of proliferation by immunoblotting \nin total tumor homogenates showed that lomitapide-treated mice \npresented with increased expression of proliferation cell nuclear \nantigen (PCNA) (+58%). In line, positive Ki-67-stained nuclei were \nincreased in tumor sections from lomitapide-treated mice. Conclu -\nsion: these studies demonstrate that MTP inhibition, blocking lipid \nsecretion from the liver, could lead to increased tumor growth, and \nrepresent the first steps in the evaluation of the role of MTP in can -\ncer development.\n326.

Bread made with this flour, can be a product that could help \nto maintain a healthy diet.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the intake of a bread made \nwith malted flour rye (MRB) on biomechanical bone parameters and \nvolume stool during 60 days, in a rat model. \nA total of 16 male Wistar rats recently weaned (8/group) were fed \nwith a control diet prepared according to the American Institute of \nNutrition Diet (C) and a  semisynthetic diet prepared with MRB. \nDuring the experience, feces were collected every 30 days to deter -\nmine the moisture content. At the end of the study rats were anes -\nthetized and the cecum from each animal was excised, split open, \nand the pH of the cecal content was measured. Right femur was \nalso excised and Limit elastic load (Wy), Diaphyseal stiffness (Wy \nDy) and Maximum fracture load (Wf max) were measured.\nMRB group presented a higher moisture content of the feces than C \ngroup at 30 and 60 days respectively (day 30: 22.0\u00b11.2 vs 13.8\u00b11.3, \np <0.0001  ; day 60: 21.1\u00b12.7 vs 11.5\u00b12.2, p <0.0001 ). The ce -\ncal content of  MRB presented a lower pH than C (6.67\u00b10.05 vs \n7.13\u00b10.14; p< 0.0001 ). \nThe MRB group presented significantly higher biomechanical \nbone properties than group C: Wy  ( 127.4\u00b17.5 vs 102.8\u00b115.4; p= MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

ZC: 1107\npau.marconec@gmail.com\nOverweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat \naccumulation caused by inadequate dietary habits and stress. Adi -\npose tissue is a metabolically active organ that secrete adipokines \ninvolved in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. We have \npreviously shown that mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) showed \noverweight and glucose intolerance. Chronic mild stress exposure \n(CMS) induced a decrease in body weight related to a decrease in \ncaloric efficiency and worsening in glucose intolerance. The aim of \nthis work was to study the participation of lipidic metabolism and \nadipokines expression in subcutaneous (SCAT) and visceral \u2013ab -\ndominal- adipose tissue (VAT) in glucose intolerance induced by \nHFD and-or CMS exposed C57Bl/6J male mice.  HFD fed mice pre -\nsented an increment in total cholesterol (p<0.0001) and free fatty \nacids (p=0.00089) without significant changes in triglycerides levels \nmeasured by commercial kits. CMS exposure did not produce any \nalteration in these parameters.  Adipokines mRNA expression was \ndeterminate by q-PCR real time. Results indicate that HFD induced \nan increase in VAT resistin expression (p=0.0002) and a diminu -\ntion in SCAT (p=0.0005). Respect to adiponectin, a decrease was \nobserved in both tissues (VAT p=0.0769, SCAT p=0.0003). In re -\nlation to leptin, no significant changes were observed. CMS expo -\nsure didn\u2019t produce significant changes in resistin and adiponectin \nexpression but a non-significant increment in VAT leptin expression \nwas observed (p=0.095).\nThese findings indicate that HFD feeding alters lipid metabolism and \nmodify the pattern of adipokines expression in different way in SCAT \nand VAT that in turn could influence the metabolic consequences of \nHFD feeding and stress exposure.\n328.

Metalloproteinases are endopepti -\ndases involved in adipose tissue remodeling. Liraglutide, a GLP-1 \nagonist, has been recently approved for obesity treatment; however \nits direct effects on VAT are still unknown. Aims: to evaluate the ef -\nfects of liraglutide on VAT remodeling and gelatinolytic activity in an \nanimal model of diet-induced obesity. Methods: Male C57/BL6 mice \n(8 weeks old) were divided into 2 groups: Control (C, n= 9) fed with \nstandard diet, and high fat diet group (HFD, n=8) fed a diet with 40% \nof total calories from fat during 15 weeks. Then, both groups were \nsubdivided according to the subcutaneous administration of liraglu -\ntide (L,  200ug/kg/day) or vehicle (equivalent volume) for 5 weeks. \nBody weight,  food and water consumption were registered week -\nly. The study was  approved by the Ethic Committee of BIOMED. \nSerum glucose, triglycerides  and HDL-cholesterol were measured \npost- L administration. Epididymal AT, as  representative of VAT, was \nremoved and weighed. Histological characteristics (adipocyte  area \nand adipocyte and vascular density) were evaluated, and metallo -\nproteinase  2 (MMP-2) activity was measured by gelatinolitic zymog -\nraphy. Results: as  expected, body weight and VAT mass was higher \nin HFD  compared to Control group (p<0.05 and p= 0.014 respective -\nly). In HFD+L  group, a significant decrease in body weight (p<0.01), \nVAT mass (p<0.01) and glucose (p=0.001) levels compared to HFD \nwas observed. Moreover, HFD+L VAT presented higher adipocyte \nand vascular density than HFD (p<0.05). MMP-2 activity was in -\ncreased in HFD+L compared to HFD (p<0.05) and it was directly \nassociated with vascular density (r= 0.821, p=0.045). Conclusions: \nIn obesity, liraglutide would improve adipose tissue functionality by \nfavoring tissue vascularization in association with an increase  in ge -\nlatinolytic activity.\n329. (207) THE SELECTIVITY OF COPPER-INDUCED PRO -\nTEIN AGGREGATES IN SERUM\nChristian Saporito Magri\u00f1\u00e1 1, Maria Laura Facio2, Marisa Ga -\nbriela Repetto1.\n1Universidad de Buenos Aires, IBIMOL, UBA-CONICET, Bue -\nnos Aires, Argentina , 2Universidad de Buenos Aires, INFI -\nBIOC, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nCopper (Cu) reactivity is largely based on its ability to participate \nin redox chemistry and nature has employed it in the active site of \ndifferent enzymes. Cu-induced damage has also been related to re -\ndox reactions. However, no antioxidant therapy has been approved \nin Cu-related pathologies and Cu-mediated non-redox reactions re -\nmain extensively unexplored in such diseases. Previously, we have \nshown the relevance of Cu-induced protein aggregation over oxi -\ndative damage and found that Cu aggregates albumin (Alb) at high \nconcentrations. We speculated that the heterogeneous group of \nproteins in serum should comprise proteins with higher propensity to \naggregation. Objective: To assess the selectivity of Cu-induced pro -\ntein aggregation in serum.  Methods: Optic density (OD), SDS-PAGE \nand proteinogram in cellulose acetate. Results: OD kinetic analysis \nof albumin (Alb), serum or plasma exposed to Cu was performed. \nProtein aggregation from healthy rat serum occurred at lower Cu \nconcentrations (less than 100 \u00b5M) than Alb. No significant differenc -\nes were observed between serum and plasma. The aggregation of \nserum proteins is dependent of Cu but independent of protein con -\ncentration. The aggregation curve of serum is flatter than Alb, likely \ndue to the heterogeneous group of proteins present in serum. With \nSDS-page we determined that serum aggregates exposed to low \nconcentrations of Cu are enriched in high molecular weight proteins \nand some low molecular weight proteins while very poor in Alb. The \nproteinogram of serum pellet obtained after Cu-induced aggregation \nshowed enrichment in gamma-globulin fraction (p<0.01). Conclu -\nsion: The formation of protein aggregates is a pathologic hallmark of \nmany diseases. Here, we show Cu can induce aggregate formation \nof specific proteins in serum. Likely, additional adverse conditions \nsuch as pH, fever, inflammation, etc. may also contribute to aggre -\ngate formation. The biological responses elicited by these aggre -\ngates require further research.\n330.

SPX regulates lipid and carbo -\nhydrate metabolism, caloric intake and body weight loss. Here, we \nevaluate the ability of SPX to improve metabolic profile and visceral \nAT function in fructose rich diet (FRD) obese mice. Four male mice \n(C57BL/6J) groups were studied: CTR mice, FRD mice (10 weeks \nof 20% w/v fructose in drinking water), and two similar groups that \nwere treated or not with SPX for ten days prior to the end of the \nprotocol (ip. 29 \u00b5g/kg/day; CTR-SPX and FRD-SPX). Body weight \nand caloric intake were recorded every day. Glucose Tolerance \nTest (GTT) was performed. Plasma was collected for triglycerides \n(TG) and glucose (GLU) levels quantification. AT depots (Inguinal \n(IAT), retroperitoneal (RPAT) and Epididymal (EAT)) were dissected, \nweighted and EAT was used for quantification of Ob, Adiponectin, \nPPAR\u03b32 and GALR2 by qPCR. Two-way ANOVA was used to deter -\nmine variable (SPX and FRD) and interaction (FRDxSPX) effects. \nSPX caused weight loss (p<0.01), regardless the diet, and a positive \ncorrelation was observed between the initial body weight and the \nbody weight loss after the 10 days SPX treatment (PCTR-SPX=0.0153 \nand PFRD-SPX= 0.0161). FRD increased total caloric intake (P<0.001), \nwhile SPX decreased it (P<0.05). TG and GLU showed no chang -\nes. However, GLU intolerance in FRD mice (P<0.001) was reverted \nby SPX treatment (P<0.05). FRD increased all AT depots masses \n(P<0.05), but SPX only generated a more marked decrease in IAT \nmass from FRD mice (SPXxFRD=0.05). SPX treatment generated \na beneficial lowering in mRNA expression of EAT markers, which \nwas greater in FRD obese mice (FRDxSPX P<0.05). In conclusion, \nSPX caused weight loss; improved GLU metabolism and visceral AT \nfunction in FRD mice. Overall, our results support the beneficial role \nof SPX treatment, especially for metabolic alterations associated to \nobesity. PICT2017-2038, PICT2019-1851, PICT2019-2787.\n331.

The contribution of the chloride anion (Cl-) to these \ndeleterious effects is unknown.\nThe objective was to evaluate whether Cl-, independent of sodium \n(Na+), would be involved in the renal and oxidative inflammatory re -\nsponse and in the development of AH. \nMale Wistar rats were divided in four groups (n=8/group) and fed \nwith different diets (3 weeks): control (C); high sodium chloride (NaCl \n8%); high Na+ without Cl- (Na3C6H5O7 11.8%); high Cl- without Na+ \n(CaCl2 3.80%; KCl 3.06%; MgCl2 1.30%). Systolic blood pressure \n(SBP), renal function and oxidative parameters in renal cortex were \ndetermined: activity and expression (by WB) of enzymes superox -\nide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase \n(GPx). We also determine chloride channels expression (CLCN5 \nand CLCNKa) as key transporters to elicit this process.  \nResults: SBP increased in NaCl and Cl- groups ( p<0.05). TBARS \nproduction increased in all three diets, without changes in the ac -tivity and expression of SOD and CAT, while the activity of GPx in -\ncreased only in Cl- group ( p<0.05). Additionally, compared with C \ngroup, NFkB expression in the kidney was increased in NaCl and Cl- \ngroups ( p<0.05), while CLCNKa expression increased in Cl- group \nand CLCN5 decreased in NaCl group.\nConclusion: Cl- contributes, at least in part, in the development of \nAH induced by NaCl overload, and diets with a high chloride content \nwould be associated with a higher prooxidant state in kidney than \nonly sodium salt diets. The role of chloride transporters as media -\ntors of oxidative damage or for the development of AH remains to \nbe elucidated.\n332.

Reproducibility of the FFQ (n=84) \nwas assessed by ARVID-FFQ1 and the same questionnaire, AR -\nVID-FFQ2, 1 year after. The assessment of validity and reproducibil -\nity was conducted by verifying standard errors of estimation, kappa \ncoefficient, and percentages of individuals classified into quartiles, \ncorrelations and Bland-Altman plots. \nResults: Vitamin D intake for over 93% surveyed participants are \ncharacterised by intake values lower than 5.0 \u00b5g per day and over \n99% by intake values lower than 10.0 \u00b5g per day. The following vi -\ntamin D intakes were observed in the studied group: 2.58 \u00b5g (0.05\u2013\n12.2 \u00b5g) for 4x24-hDRs, 3.57 \u00b5g (1.1\u201310.6 \u00b5g) for ARVID-FFQ1, \n3.61 \u00b5g (0.1\u201310.4 \u00b5g) for ARVID-FFQ2. The Bland-Altman indexes \nin assessment of validity and reproducibility were 5% and 1.1%, re -\nspectively, with mean differences of -0.15 \u00b5g and 0.02 \u00b5g, as well \nas limits of agreement -0.65\u20130.34 \u00b5g and -0.07\u20130.12 \u00b5g. The kappa \ncoefficient indicated a fair agreement for validity (0.35) and moder -\nate for reproducibility (0.48), while correlations were significant (p < \n0.0001, r = 0.54 for validity; p < 0.0001, r = 0.61 for reproducibility).\nConclusion: Vitamin D intake in most cases was inadequate for this \nparticular population at high risk for COVID-19. The VIDEO-FFQ \ncan be considered a practical tool with satisfactory validity and re -\nproducibility, making it convenient for estimating vitamin D intake in \nthe Argentine population.\n333.

The 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) has been described as a \nspecific biomarker of oxidative damage mediated by peroxynitrite. \nThis study aimed to develop a liquid chromatography-tandem mass \nspectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantification of 3-NT in \nurine and liver tissue samples from dairy cows and described the \n3-NT concentration in plasma, urine, and liver during the transition \nperiod in the spring (SG) and winter (WG) seasons. The developed \nmethod was validated following the Food and Drug Administration \nguideline. The matrix effect was negligible for urine and there was a \nmedium matrix effect for liver tissue. The calibration curve of 3-NT \nwas fitted with a 1/x2 weighted linear regression over the concentra -\ntion range of 0.24-19.31 mg/L, for urine, and 2.27-102.04 mg/L, for \nliver tissue. Regarding the dilution study, the factor was 1/5 for urine \nand 1/10 for liver tissue. The precision was < 15 % and the accura -\ncy was in the range of 85\u2013115 %. 3-NT was stable in the different \nmatrices after short-term storage for 30 days at -80 \u00b0C, after long-\nterm storage for six months at -80\u00b0 C, and after three freeze and \nthaw cycles. In plasma, urine, and liver samples, 3-NT concentration \nwas higher in cows of the SG than in those of the WG (p < 0.05). A \nhigh correlation was observed between 3-NT concentration in urine \nand liver (r = 0.74; p < 0.01) and a moderate correlation between \nplasma and urine (r = 0.61; P  < 0.01) and between that in plasma \nand liver (r = 0.55; p < 0.01).

Instituto de Bio -\nqu\u00edmica y Medicina Molecular (IBIMOL), Buenos Aires, Ar -\ngentina.\nGlaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease that affects eye struc -\ntures and brain areas related to the visual system. Oxidative stress \nplays a key role in the development and progression of the disease. \nThe aim was to evaluate the redox balance in the cornea in a glau -\ncoma model. \n3-month Wistar rats were operated by cauterizing two of the epis -\ncleral veins in the left eye: glaucoma group (G n=4); the control \ngroup (C n=4) received a sham procedure. Seven days after surgery \nrats were euthanized, eyes were enucleated and right (RC) and left \n(LC) corneas were isolated (CICUAL FFyB n\u00b0 3314). Damage to \nmacromolecules, antioxidant enzymes activities and NOX and iNOS \nexpression were evaluated.\nWhen compared to CG, GG-LE showed an increase of 100% in \nprotein oxidation ( p<0.01 ) and 38% in nitrotyrosine expression \n(p<0.05 ). Both NOX4 and iNOS expression were 76% ( p<0.01 ) and \n160 % ( p<0.001 ) higher in G-LC, respectively. A 65% increase in \nSOD activity ( p<0.05 ) was measured in both corneas in G. Howev -\ner, GPx activity and CAT levels increased 46% ( p<0.001 ) and 80% \n(p<0.001 ) in G-RC, respectively, without any changes in LC. Finally, \nthere was a 50% decrease in GR activity in G-LC.\nThese results suggest that glaucoma induces damage to the cor -\nnea, such as oxidative modifications to macromolecules, due to an \nenhancement in oxidative species production from NOX and iNOS. \nIn this context, the RE cornea presents an adaptive response in -\ncreasing the antioxidant enzymes, while SOD is the only enzyme \nincreased in LC. In addition, glutathione levels could be impaired \nsince its recycling is decreased due to the decay of GR activity in \nLC. The understanding of corneal impairment in this pathology is \nimportant since it could lead to the development of novel therapeutic \napproaches.335. (264) MATERNAL FRUCTOSE CONSUMPTION IMPACTS \nON THE DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOME OF ITS PROGENY\nMarie Luc\u00eda Cuervo S\u00e1nchez 1, Facundo Prado Spalm 1, Na-\ntalia Edith Furland 1, Ana Sof\u00eda Vall\u00e9s1.\n1Laboratorio de Nutrici\u00f3n y Neurodesarrollo- Instituto de In -\nvestigaciones Bioqu\u00edmicas de Bah\u00eda Blanca (INIBIBB), Uni -\nversidad Nacional del Sur (UNS-CONICET). \nRecent epidemiological evidence suggests that exposure to mater -\nnal obesity increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in \noffspring. Given the rise in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome \n(MetS), a clinical condition closely related to obesity, it is important \nto understand the molecular mechanisms by which maternal MetS \nmight impact offspring behavior and brain function. \nTen, two-months-old female Wistar rats from our colony were sep -\narated in two groups of five rats each, control (C) and fructose 20% \n(F). The former drank tap water while the later drank fructose 20 % \n(w/v) ad libitum  during 10 weeks. Both F- and C dams were mated \nto chow-fed male rats on the 7th week of treatment and maintained \non their respective diets throughout pregnancy and sacrificed on \nday 4 postpartum. At postnatal day (PN) 1, the progeny from both \ngroups were separated from their mothers and continued lactating \nfrom control nurse dams. From PN3-PN21 neurodevelopmental re -\nflexes were evaluated. At PN22 all pups were weaned and behav -\nioral tests (open field, marble test, elevated plus maze, novel object \nrecognition, social reciprocal interaction test, tail flick test, rotarod, \nKondziela\u2019s inverted screen test) were performed on 4- to 12-week-\nold female and male rats. Results were considered statistically dif -\nferent between the C and the F group when a p value  of 5% or lower \n(p< 0.05) was obtained when applying the t-student  test.\nOur findings strongly associate maternal fructose consumption with \nthe induction of MetS and infertility. In addition, offspring from the F \ngroup presented alterations in the developmental milestones and \nsocial behavior; decreased grip strength and increased anxiety. Fur -\nthermore, long term memory also showed a tendency to be reduced. \nNo modifications were noted in compulsive like behaviors, locomo -\ntion nor in nociception. All in all, maternal fructose consumption im -\npacts on the developmental outcome of its progeny.  \n336.

E-mail: echartesm@gmail.com\nGrowth restriction in utero is associated with the development of \nobesity and diabetes. The current understanding is that intrauter -\nine deprivation programs the individual for a deprived environment, \nand that such programming is maladaptive in a no deprived envi -\nronment. The liver plays an essential role in metabolism regulation.\nThe objective of this work was to analyze the liver function of the \noffspring of malnourished parents. Two types of experiments were \ncarried out: 1) the parents (F1) were chronically malnourished from \ntheir gestation. They were studied at 120 days of age; 2) other group \nof malnourished rats at 120 days were mated and their offspring \nwere analyzed at weaning. On day 120 (F1) and day 24 (F2) blood \nwas obteined and the liver was dissected out. Body weight and bio -\nchemical parameters were measured. Chronicle protein malnutri -\ntion induced increased serum glucose and insulin (p<0.05) in F1. \nSecondly, serum glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol were signifi -\ncantly higher in the malnourished (F2M) group with respect to the \ncontrol (F2C) and liver proteins and glycogen contein were lower \n(p<0.05). In F2, the values of insulin were higher with respect to \nthe control (p<0.05) while the values of leptin and adiponectin were \nsignificantly lower in the F2M group. Oxidative stress markers (ROS, \nlipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation) showed higher values \nwith respect to the control. These changes were associated with in -\ncreased pro-inflammatory cytokines production. Serum IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 \nand TGF-\u03b2 were significantly higher in F2M group with respect to ABSTRACTS181\nthe control (p<0.05).These results suggest that protein malnutrition \nduring the development predisposes to the occurrence of diabetes \nand the increment of liver inflammation and oxidative stress markers \nin their offspring.\n337.

The aim of this study is evaluate the protective role of \nresveratrol supplementation on chronic inflammation and oxidative \nstress associated to MS. Voluntary patients with a diagnosis of MS \n(n=92) based on the diagnostic criteria of the National Cholesterol \nEducation Program, Adult treatment Panel III, 2002 received a di -\netary supplement (RTP: 50 mg resveratrol, 25 mg alpha-tocopher -\nol and 5 mg piperine) along with their usual treatment for a period \nof 3 months. Piperine increases resveratrol and alpha-tocopherol \nabsorption. Control was the patient himself in baseline conditions, \navoiding interindividual variables and bioavailability of active princi -\nples. Venous blood was collected from 23 patients (68 \u00b1 5 years), \nand biochemical markers were assessed in plasma: protein oxida -\ntion (measured as carbonyl protein, CO), and interleukin 6 (IL-6); \nand in red blood cells (RBC): catalase activity. Patients were classi -\nfied into 3 groups according to the amount of risk factors (blood glu -\ncose, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, waist circumference and blood \npressure) for MS: 3/5 (n=7), 4/5 (n=5) and 5/5 (n=11) risk factors. \nPreliminary results showed increase in catalase activity (22-32%, \np<0.05) in the 3 groups of patients after RTP treatment, without dif -\nferences between groups. When blood glucose, HDL-cholesterol \nand Triglycerides risk factors were evaluated separately, it was ob -\nserved that they all impact on catalase activity in the same way after \nRTP treatment. No significant differences were observed in IL-6 and \nCO after RTP neither among groups. RTP treatment improves the \nenzymatic antioxidant response by protecting cells from oxidative \ndamage by hydrogen peroxide generated in inflammatory process -\nes, regardless of the risk factors of the MS patient. \n338.

Argen -\ntina\nCafeteria (CAF) diet, composed by palatable foods high in saturated \nfat and refined carbohydrates, leads to a deregulation of lipid me -\ntabolism with hepatic triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation which can \nprogress to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Flaxseed oil \n(FO) can be used as a functional food ingredient due to its potential \nhealth benefits and excellent nutrient profile. The principal compo -\nnent of virgin FO is \u03b1-linolenic acid, which can be enriched with lig -\nnans (LGN). This preliminary study aimed to investigate the effects \nof virgin FO rich in LGN on the alterations induced by the cafeteria \ndiet. Wistar rats (310g) were fed during 60 days with the diets: control \n(SO): soybean oil 4%, CAF (C): lipids 30% and CAF+FO (CF): lipids \n26%+4% FO rich in LGN. Food intake, body weight gain, relative \nepididymal (EAT) and retroperitoneal (RPAT) adipose tissues and \nliver weights; and serum TAG, cholesterol (CHO) and glucose (GLU) \nlevels, were measured. Liver fatty acids profile was determinate by gas chromatography. Data were analyzed by One-Way ANOVA \nfollowed by Tukey\u00b4s test (p<0.05). The results were: food intake: \nSO(108,2a\u00b16,5), C(140,1b\u00b16,5) and CF(125,9b\u00b12,6), body weight \ngain: SO(115a\u00b13,6), C(170,6b\u00b14,1), CF(155,8b\u00b17,7); relative tissues \nweights: EAT: SO(2,44a\u00b10,12), C(3,09b\u00b10,07) and CF(2,53a\u00b10,11); \nRPAT: SO(3,95a\u00b10,14), C(4,60b\u00b10,11) and CF(3,81a\u00b10,24) and \nliver: SO(2,24a\u00b10,04), C(2,52b\u00b10,07) and CF(2,52b\u00b10,03); serum \nTAG: SO(2,31a\u00b10,14), C(3,10b\u00b10,12) and CF(2,33a\u00b10,26), CHO: \nSO(0,98a\u00b10,02), C(0,80b\u00b10,04) and CF(0,81b\u00b10,04) and GLU: \nSO(1,53a\u00b10,07), C(2,17b\u00b10,20), CF(1,56a\u00b10,05). In liver n-3 poly -\nunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were increased (200%) and n-6/n-3 \nratio was diminished (70%) by CF vs C. In conclusion, these pre -\nliminary results showed that virgin FO rich in LGN attenuates some \nnegative effects on lipid alterations induced by cafeteria diet, dimin -\nishing adipose tissues weights and serum TAG levels, as well as, \nimproving liver fatty acids profile.\n339.

The \nsupplemented group (SG; n = 11) received subcutaneously a dose \nof 5 ml of the vitamin supplement ADAPTADOR\u00ae Vit and 5 ml of \nthe mineral supplement ADAPTADOR\u00ae Min (Biogenesis Bag\u00f3, Bs. \nAs.; vitamin A palmitate 3.5% and vitamin E acetate 5%, copper \nedetate 1%, zinc edetate 4%, manganese edetate 1% and sodium \nselenite 0.5%) on -60, -30 and 7 days relative to calving. The control \ngroup (CG; n = 11) received two injections of 5 ml of 0.9 % sodi -\num chloride. Blood, urine and liver biopsies were sampled at -21, 7 \nand 21 days relative to calving and to evaluate 3-NT. Also, plasma \nconcentrations of non-esterified fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate, \nglucose, albumin, cholesterol, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, \ngamma-glutamyl transferase and liver triacylglycerol content were \nspectrophotometrically measured. In cows of the SG, 3-NT con -\ncentration was greater in plasma (p < 0.05) and lesser in the liver \ntissue (p < 0.05). In addition, a lesser liver triacylglycerol content \nand greater glucose concentration was detected in cows of the SG \n(p < 0.05). Regarding albumin, plasma concentration was greater \nin cows of the SG (p < 0.05), with a supplementation x time effect \n(p < 0.05), being particularly greater on day 21 pre-calving and day \n4 post-calving. No statistical differences were evidenced in the other \nstudied parameters. These results suggest that mineral and vitamin \nsupplementation could ameliorate the oxidative stress in the liver \nand the transition of dairy cows.\n340.

Intestinal \ndysbiosis, related to insulin-resistance, may alter the expression of \nMTTP in different manners in intestine and liver, which could affect \nthe triglyceride-rich lipoproteins contributing to atherogenic dysli -\npemia. Aim: to evaluate intestinal (I) and hepatic (H) MTTP expres -\nsion and their association with triglyceride-rich lipoprotein character -\nistics in a diet-induced dysbiosis animal model. Methods: 12 male \nWistar rats (180-200g) were fed with standard diet (Control, n=6) \nor standard diet plus 40% fat+15% sucrose (HFSD, n=6) during 14 \nweeks. Glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), lipoprotein profile and lipo -\npolysaccharides (LPS) as altered gut microbiota marker, were mea -\nsured in sera. CM and VLDL were isolated by ultracentrifugation and \nlipid composition was measured. In I and H MTTP expression were \nevaluated by Western Blot. Results: Compared to Control: HFSD \nshowed higher LPS (p<0.01), TG (p<0.001), nonHDL-chol (p=0.01), \nFFA (p<0.05) and TG/HDL-chol as surrogate of insulin-resistance \n(p<0.001). CM and VLDL composition showed higher TG (p<0.001) \nand phospholipids (p<0.05) proportion. H-MTTP was increased \n(p<0.001) although no differences were found in I-MTTP (p=0.145). \nI-MTTP was associated with CM-TG (r=0.72;p<0.01), TG/HDL-\nchol (r=0.58;p<0.05) and inversely with LPS (r=-0.79;p=0.03). \nH-MTTP correlated with VLDL-TG (r=0.50;p<0.05), TG/HDL-chol \n(r=0.65;p<0.01), and LPS (r=0.68;p<0.05). Conclusions : This is the \nfirst time that I- and H- MTTP are reported in a diet-induced dysbi -\nosis model. MTTP promotes TG over-enriched CM and VLDL, that \nprobably to the atherogenic profile. The difference in I- and H- MTTP \nlevels and the opposite correlation that maintain with LPS, suggest \nan earlier response of the liver to intestinal dysbiosis, in the studied \nperiod. \nThe study was approved by the Comit\u00e9 Institucional para el Cuidado \ny Uso de Animales de Laboratorio (CICUAL)-FFYB-UBA (REDEC-\n2020-2292-E-UBA-DCT FFYB & REDEC-2021-592-E-UBA-DCT \nFFYB).\n341.

High-fat (HF) fed mice develop \nobesity, insulin-resistance, and dyslipidemia, all of which are condi -\ntions that also contribute to chronic kidney disease. Previously, we \nshowed that EC supplementation mitigated dysmetabolism devel -\noped by HF-fed mice related to an attenuation in TLR-4 mediated \ninflammation in kidney. In this work, we studied, in the same exper -\nimental model, modifications in proteins involved in TJs in kidney \nresponsible for the permeability barrier, i.e.  zonula occludens-1 \n(ZO1) and claudin-2 (cldn2). C57BL/6J male mice were divided into \n4 groups: control (C), control + 20 mg EC/kg body weight (CE), HF \ndiet (60% fat from lard), and HF diet + EC (HFE). At the end of a \n14-d treatment, mice were euthanized, and blood and kidney sam -\nples were obtained. Serum creatinine levels were 41 % higher in HF \nrespect to the other groups (p\u02c20.05, ANOVA, Tukey\u2019s test) showing \na protection of EC against renal damage; this protection was also \nobserved in parameters of inflammation and fibrosis. ZO1 and cldn2 \nabundance were evaluated by histochemistry. ZO1, expressed as positive area in %, was C: 45\u00b13, CE: 52\u00b11, HF: 13\u00b11*, and HFE: 13\u00b1 \n1* (*p\u02c20.05 vs C and CE, Kruskal\u2013Wallis, Dunn\u2019s test), would imply a \nloss of integrity in the permeability barrier that was not attenuated by \nEC supplementation. Changes in cldn2 detection showed a 28% of \nincrease in HF respect to C and CE, and a decrease of 49% in HFE \nrespect to HF. These results are indicative that the HF-diet in the \npresent conditions affects the two proteins differentially. The action \nof EC restoring HF triggered high levels of clnd2 to below control val -\nues, is relating clnd2 to the observed renal function protection, includ -\ning inflammation and fibrosis.

Facultad de Far -\nmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica. Buenos Aires, Argentina\n  \nNon-Alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common \nchronic liver disease in adults worldwide, highly associated with \nobesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Liver steato -\nsis depends on triglycerides (TG) accumulation from the novo fatty \nacids (FA) and TG synthesis, the influx of free FA (FFA) and the \nmetabolism of remnant lipoproteins (RLP). In physiological states, \nthe contribution of VLDLReceptor (VLDL-R) in the latter pathway \nhas not been reported. Besides, the release of liver VLDL, depends \non its synthesis throughout Microsomal TG transfer protein (MTTP). \nOur aim was to evaluate the expression of VLDL-R and MTTP in \nliver biopsies from NAFLD patients and their possible association \nwith the steatosis grade (SG).  \nMethods: We studied 17 patients with NAFLD of both sexes (56\u00b112 \nyears, women: 82%). In liver biopsies, protein levels of VLDLR and \nMTTP were evaluated by Western blot. In serum samples we as -\nsessed lipoprotein and hepatic profile; platelets were measured in \nblood. We calculated the fibrosis scores APRI, FIB-4 and NFS. \nResults: Studied patients were mostly obese, with normal hepatic \nfunction. Glycemic control was altered, and an atherogenic dys -\nlipidemia was verified, with increased insulin-resistance markers. \nVLDL-R was expressed in liver biopsies, tending to increase in \nthose patients with higher SG (0.44\u00b10.20 RU in patients with <33% \nSG vs 0.64\u00b10.13 RU in patients with >33%, p=ns). VLDL-R showed \na tendency to positively correlate with APRI score and negatively \nwith RLP-Cholesterol (C) despite not being significant (p=0.42 and \n0.39 respectively). MTTP expression tended to associate positively \nwith nonHDL-C (p=0.06) and LDL-C (p=0.07).\nConclusion: The expression of VLDL-R in NAFLD patients is a chal -\nlenging finding that would contribute to the influx of FFA to the liver, \nworsening the TG accumulation in the hepatocytes.

The aim of this study \nwas to investigate whether in high-fructose fed rats, EC treatment \ninduces changes in hemodynamics and thoracic aorta PVAT (taP -\nVAT) characteristics in terms of thermogenic capacity and NLRP3 in -\nflammasome activation.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into \n4 groups: C: control diet and tap water; CEC: EC (20 mg/kg BW/d) in \nthe diet and tap water; F:  control diet and 10% (w/v) fructose in the \nwater, and FEC: EC in the diet and fructose in the water. After 8 w, \nBP was determined, animals were euthanized and blood (plasma), \naorta, and taPVAT were obtained for biochemical and histological \ndeterminations.As was expected, EC supplementation attenuated \nBP increase induced by high-fructose diet. Aorta morphometry did \nnot show differences among the experimental groups. taPVAT area/\naorta lumen showed higher value in F respect to C (16%, p\u02c20.05), \nthat was attenuated by EC supplementation. Adipocyte size was not \nsignificantly affected by the treatments. Levels of uncoupling-protein \n1 (UCP-1) and the mitochondrial marker VDAC, were measured by \nwestern blot. UCP-1 expression was higher only in CEC respect to \nC (64%, p\u02c2 0.05). NLRP3 inflammasome pathways was evaluated \nin taPVAT, but NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 did not show signif -\nicant differences among the experimental groups. In conclusion:i) \nEC-induced alterations in taPVAT could be linked to changes in \nBP, ii) EC showed a browning effect in control animals that was not \npresent in high-fructose fed animals, iii) no changes were observed \nin the inflammasome NLRP3 pathway. Further research is neces -\nsary to understand the relevance of taPVAT modifications in he -\nmodynamics changes in this model.

Previous results from our laboratory showed an \nincrease in serum triglyceride (TAG) levels in rats fed a sucrose rich \ndiet (SRD) for 12 weeks. The administration of hemin (15mg/kg ip, \nevery 48hs) during the last two weeks of SRD reduced TAG levels, \nwhile no changes were detected in systemic insulin resistance and \nhepatic triglyceride levels. Based on these results the aim of the \npresent study was to analyze the effects of hemin on hepatic lipid \nmetabolism. Male Wistar rats were randomly distributed into control \n(C) and SRD groups (30% sucrose in the drinking water). Hemin \nwas administered as described (SRD+H). Livers were harvested \nand total RNA and proteins were extracted. Our results showed an \nincreased gene expression of the transcription factor ChREBP, and \nthe lipid synthesis enzymes FAS and ACC1 (0,001 vs. C group), as \nwell as  FAS protein expression (0,001 vs. C) in SRD treated rats. \nAlthough hemin administration had no effect on the gene expression \nof ChREBP or ACC1, it caused a significant increase in SREBP1c, \nFAS, and DGAT1/2 levels (0,05 vs. SRD or C). Interestingly, when \nwe analyze the genes involved in the liver capacity to oxidize lipids \nwe found that SRD+H treated animals showed an increase in the gene expression of PPAR \ud835\udec2, CPT1\ud835\udec2 and ACOX1 \ud835\udec2 (0,01, 0,05, and \n0.001 vs. SRD respectively). Furthermore, protein levels of p-AMPK \nand nuclear protein levels of PPAR \ud835\udec2 were also increased (0,05 and \n0,01 vs. C and SRD, respectively). In summary our results led us \nto hypothesize that hemin administration associated with a reduc -\ntion of triglyceridemia is due to an increase in the oxidation of lipids \nwithin the liver, possibly through the stimulation of the AMPK/PPAR \ud835\udec2\npathway.\n345. (444) HO-1 AS A THERAPEUTIC TARGET IN A RAT MOD -\nEL OF MAFLD: KEY ROLE OF KUPFFER CELLS\nEsteban Mart\u00edn Repetto1,2, Morena Wiszniewski2,3, Diego \nMori2, Camila Martinez Calejman2 and Cora Beatriz Cymery -\nng2,3.\n1Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Departamento de Bio -\nqu\u00edmica Cl\u00ednica, C\u00e1tedra Bioqu\u00edmica Cl\u00ednica I, Universidad \nde Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina. 2 Facultad de \nMedicina, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas \ny T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Centro de Estudios Farmacol\u00f3gicos \ny Bot\u00e1nicos (CEFYBO), Laboratorio de Endocrinolog\u00eda Mo -\nlecular (LEM), Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, \nArgentina. 3Facultad de Medicina, Departamento de Bioqu\u00ed -\nmica Humana, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, \nArgentina. \nCurrently, metabolic dysfunction associated with fatty liver affects a \nquarter of the world population, but no pharmacological treatment \nhas been recommended yet. We have previously shown that de -\npletion of Kupffer cells (KC) in rats fed a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) for \n12 weeks attenuates tissue injury and prevents liver inflammation, \nwithout changing the degree of steatosis. The aim of this study was \nto evaluate the effects of hemin treatment (an HO-1 inducer) on liver \ndamage induced by SRD and identify the underlying mechanisms.\nSRD-treated rats are presented with IR, hepatic steatosis, and high \nserum levels of NEFAS, glycemia, and triacylglycerides (TAG). Ad -\nministration of hemin for the last two weeks of the dietary intervention \n(15 mg/kg/48h, SRD+H) did not modify these parameters, except \nfor the observed reduction in serum TAG levels. A lower degree of \nballooning (histological change compatible with injury) as well as a \ndecrease in oxidative stress parameters (TBARS and 3-nitrotyrosine \nlevels, SOD and catalase activities), UPR (expression of XBP1s, \nATF4 and GRP78) and apoptosis (TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 \nexpression) were also detected in SRD-treated rats. The induction \nof HO-1 expression in KC by hemin was associated with lower tissue \nlevels of IL1 b, TNF a and pP65 compared to the SRD group. Induc -\ntion of PEPCK as well as the response to pyruvate were blocked by \nhemin, that also restored the ratio pAkt/Akt altered by SRD. Finally, \nanimals in the SRD+H group showed an increase in the expression \nof PPAR a, CPT1 a and ACOX1 a (proteins involved in lipid oxida -\ntion), and an increase in pAMPK (vs. SRD). In summary, our results \nlead us to hypothesize that administration of hemin attenuates liver \ninjury induced by sucrose diet by reducing the pro-inflammatory tone \nof the KC associated with the induction of HO-1. Moreover, hemin \ntreatment is also able to decrease TAG serum levels by increasing \nlipid oxidation through the stimulation of the AMPK/PPAR a pathway \nin the liver.\n346.

Simple methods as anthropometry (A) \nand bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) use prediction equations \nto estimate BC meanwhile isotopic dilution technique (ID) is used as \nreference method. The aim was to estimate the FM of school chil -\ndren by prediction equations using anthropometric measurements \n(Aeq) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIAeq) and to compare \nthem to that determined by ID as reference method. 250 school chil -\ndren aged 6-12 years from JV. Gonz\u00e1lez School of the University of \nLa Plata and from neighborhood clubs of La Plata, Olmos and Villa \nElisa were studied. Body weight (kg), height (cm) and skinfolds (mm) \nwere evaluated to estimate %FM by five anthropometric equations \nand resistance values (ohms) were used to estimate fat free mass \n(%FFM) through eight BIA equations. Deuterium oxide dose (0.5g/\nkg body weight) was given orally, and a saliva sample was collect -\ned. Deuterium concentration was measured by FTIR, %FFM was \ndetermined and %FM was obtained as 100-%FFM. %FM estimated \nby Aeq and BIAeq were between 23.3\u00b14.6-27.1\u00b18.3 and 18.4\u00b17.2-\n28.2\u00b17.9, respectively, while %FM determined by ID was 29.3\u00b17.2. \nAll values were statistically lower regarding ID (p<0.0001). When \nBland-Altman test was applied to analyze the agreement between \nmethods, high variability and even bias were observed. FM estimat -\ned through different prediction equations was different than the one \nobtained using a reference method, such as ID. This fact strength -\nens the need to have our own equations, developed and validated \nin local populations. In this way, local equations could be applied \ndepending on the availability of anthropometric or BIA instruments.\n347. (468) TLR4 KO MICE ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO THE EF -\nFECTS OF A HIGH-FAT DIET INTAKE THAN C57BL/6J \nMICE BUT MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO STRESS\nSof\u00eda Quiroga, Mar\u00eda P. Marcone, Julieta L.

Mice under chronic stress (CS) gained less body \nweight (BW). TLR4 receptor knockout mice (KO) do not show in -\nflammation under high-fat diet (HFD) intake, although their stress \nresponse is unknown. Here we studied the metabolic and behavioral \neffects of HFD intake and CS exposure in both strains. \nAt 4 weeks of age, mice received a standard diet (SD) or a HFD. \nAfter 12 weeks, they were exposed (or not) to CS for 8 weeks. Re -\nsulting in 4 groups for each strain: 1) SD, 2) SD+CS, 3) HFD and 4) \nHFD+CS. We recorded BW, blood glucose (GLU), lipid metabolism \nand behavioral tests.\nAfter 12 weeks of HFD, WT showed higher BW gain (p<0.01) and \nGLU (p<0.01) vs WT SD mice. However, KO showed a lower BW \ngain (p<0.001 vs KO SD) without changes in GLU. After 8 weeks of \nCS, WT CS mice showed a lower BW gain (SD: p<0.01 and HFD: \np<0.001), whereas KO HFD+CS had a higher BW gain than HFD \n(p<0.05). GLU levels at the end of the experiment were higher in \nKO under CS than non-CS mice, while HFD induced an increase in \nGLU in WT mice. Although, we have not observed any changes in \nthe lipid metabolism estimated by total cholesterol and triglycerides.  \nIn relation to behavioral performance, CS+HFD increased locomotor \nactivity in WT (p<0.05) but not in KO. In contrast, KO mice showed \na lower habituation capacity than WT.  Moreover, the spatial object \nrecognition test was altered in WT by HFD and CS, whereas in KO \nonly CS exposure produced a decrease in the discrimination rate in \nthis test (p<0.05).  Also, spontaneous alternation was unaffected in \nWT mice, although we observed a reduction induced by CS in KO \nfor both diets (p<0.05). \nThese findings suggest that KO mice have not responded to HFD \nbut are more sensitive to stress exposure. Further experiments are \nnecessary to explore the role of Toll Receptors in the enhanced \nstress sensitivity observed.\n348.

Zinc quantification was performed by inductively coupled plas -\nma mass spectrometry.\nThe %DZn was less than 10% in all the analyzed noodle variants, \nwithout significant differences between them. The APZn in all cases \nwas less than 168 \u00b5g / 80g (standard portion of noodles). The results \nshowed significant losses of zinc during cooking (p <0.05), increas -\ning according to the treatment time and registering lower losses \nwith the addition of salt to the water. On the other hand, significant \nweight losses were observed when the cooking time was prolonged \n(p <0.05). They were lower at a higher concentration of added sodi -\num chloride (p <0.05).\nConsidering its bioaccessibility and cooking losses, this type of food \nhardly contributes to meeting the requirements of the mineral in \nquestion.\n349.

Its \nleather is appreciated in the fashion industry and meat is valued as \na source of high quality animal protein because it contains essen -\ntial fatty acids (FA) important for human nutrition. Fat is generally \ndiscarded because it has no commercial value, increasing envi -\nronmental pollution and eliminating a potential source of valuable \nnatural oils. The objective was to extract oil from the fat of CL and \nperform the chemical and microbiological characterization for its use \nas a dietary supplement. In addition, the acceptability of the oil was \ncarried out in a group of 100 consumers and it was expressed on \na hedonic scale from 1 -9, with 9 being the most accepted. Ath -\nerogenicity index (AI), thrombogenicity index (TI) and the presence \nof aerobic mesophilic and coliforms bacteria, Escherichia coli  and \nSalmonella  were determined. Four methods of oil extraction based \non solvent extraction and melting were evaluated and data analysis ABSTRACTS185\nwas performed by using ANOVA. The selected extraction method \n(melting at 80\u00baC) presented an excellent yield (89% w/w) and by \nmeans of gas chromatography it was determined that the FA con -\ntent does not change after heating. The oil obtained contains FA of \nhigh nutritional quality such as oleic acid (34%), linoleic acid (30%) \nand \u03b1-linolenic acid (2%). The AI   was 0.29 and TI was 0.47. The oil \ncontained no organic solvents and no microbial load. Due to its ex -\ncellent oxidative stability, it can be produced and stored at 25\u2070C for \n4 months maintaining its physicochemical properties and nutritional \nquality. This may be related to the presence of reducing substances \nand free radical scavengers that increase its antioxidant capacity. \nThe acceptability was 8,1 \u00b1 1,3, which indicates that it was highly \naccepted by consumers. Due to its excellent nutritional quality, the \noil obtained from caiman fat could be used for nutrition.\n350.

Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda, Bioinform\u00e1tica, Universidad Nacio -\nnal de Entre Rios\nIt has been suggested that colorectal cancer (CRC) cells show a \ndistinctive metabolic organization at different development stages \nas in response to stress. We determined the value of metabolism \nreprogramming in CRC patients against controls and at different \nstages (I-IV) by means of bioinformatic tools. We employed 49 CRC \nsamples from E-GEOD50421 microarray (569.593 probes specifics \nto human genes) and 10 controls. The informatics free access tools \nwere: Mev4 to heat map (1.5, 2 & 2.5 fold differences); DAVID and \nReactome. The study of gene expression in CRC patients versus \ncontrols revealed that this disease alters the levels of expression of \ngenes associated with cell adhesion and proliferation that promote \nthe cell growth and mobility. Other overexpressed genes in CRC \nsamples correspond to prognosis, tumor diagnosis or genes closely \nassociated to cell metabolism. Gene related to carbohydrate and \nlipid metabolism differed by 2 fold in CRC patients. At stages I and II \nour results showed a significant increase in oncogenic markers and \ngenes of glutaminolysis, while at stage III, the significant 2 fold ex -\npression was on fatty acids pathway genes, including acyl-CoA and \nphosphatidylserine. At stage IV, we evidenced an increase in the ex -\npression of tetraspanin 5, CRNEP and MMP7, genes associated to \ncancer progress in advanced stages and metastasis. In conclusions, \nduring the development of the disease, the metabolic pathways are \nreprogrammed, increasing glycolysis, glutaminolysis and fatty acid \nsynthesis. Our results showed that CRC cells exhibit the \u201cWarburg \nEffect\u201d at early stages (I-II) while at stage III cancer cells increase \nthe uptake of extracellular lipids and lipoproteins, and up regulate de \nnovo lipid biosynthesis and synthesis of cholesterol, which produce \nlipid metabolites for cell membranes at  stage III and IV of CRC, \nsuggesting that patients would have higher circulating levels of fatty \nacids than patients at early stages.\n351.

It was \nsuggested that hydroxychloroquine, used to mobilize and eliminate \nporphyrins, could be a suitable treatment. This hypothesis made us \nthink about how COVID-19 could affect porphyric patients who usu -\nally have high content of porphyrins.  Pandemic affected the amount \nof diagnosis during 2020, being diagnosed only 6 cases: 4 PCT, \n1EPP, 1 CEP. Until August 2021 we diagnosed: 22 PCT, 7 PAI, 2 VP \nand 1 EPP. A review of last 10 years showed that AIP cases in 2021, \nwere about the median value (4.5\u00b12.2) while PCT were significantly \nlow (64\u00b19.6). Moreover, 29 patients had COVID-19: 20 AIP and 3 \nPCT in spite of PCT is 10 times more frequent (PCT 1:20000, PAI \n1:215000). Two AIP patients were hospitalized and only one needed \nrespiratory assistance. Another AIP patient suffered an acute attack \ntwo months after COVID-19 positive. Heme parameters values were \nsimilar to that usually determined in these patients. This retrospec -\ntive analysis allows us to conclude that COVID-19 does not have a \ndifferent expression than that of general population, no worsening \nrelated to the porphyric condition was observed.

In addition, extra virgin olive \noil (EVOO) with high content of polyphenols and tocopherols has \nshown anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and preventive properties \nagainst metabolic alterations. Moreover, previously we showed that \nDHA+EVOO co-administration exhibits synergistic beneficial ef -\nfects. Accordingly, the aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of \nDHA+EVOO co-administration on the fatty acids (FA) profile in the \nliver and extrahepatic tissues in a mouse model of HFD-induced \nobesity. Male C57BL/6J mice received: control diet (CD) (10% fat), \nDC+DHA, DC+EVOO, DC+DHA+EVOO, high fat diet (HFD) (60% \nfat), HFD+DHA, HFD+EVOO, HFD+DHA+EVOO for 12 weeks con -\nforming 8 experimental groups (Doses DHA and EVOO: 50 mg/kg/\nday). The total FA composition was analyzed by gas-liquid chroma -\ntography in: liver, brain, heart, kidney, intestine, testicle, plasma and \nerythrocytes. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA \nand Tukey\u2019s test, p<0.05 was considered to be significant. The HFD \nadministered for 12 weeks caused increase in saturated FA, main -\nly C16:0 palmitic, reduction of n-3 LCPUFA and increased n-6/n-3 \nLCPUFA ratio in all studied tissues. In HFD-fed mice that received \nDHA+EVOO a normalization in n-3 LCPUFA content was achieved \nin all tissues. Interestingly, the reduction in eicosapentaenoic acid \ncaused by HFD was attenuated by 60% in this group. The results \nof the present work suggest that the combined administration of \nDHA+EVOO could be considered as a preventive nutritional strat -\negy to address metabolic diseases. New studies are necessary in \norder to evaluate the effects and mechanisms involved in extrahe -\npatic tissues.\n354. (593) CHARACTERIZATION OF A GENETIC MURINE \nMODEL OF ACUTE INTERMITTENT PORPHYRIA. AN \nOVER TIME STUDY\nMar\u00eca Del Carmen Mart\u00ednez1,2, Johanna Romina Zuccoli1, \nSilvina Fernanda Ruspini1, Ana Mar\u00eda Buzaleh1,2\nAcute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an inherited disease due to \nPorphobilinogen deaminase (PBG-D) deficiency. Mouse models of \nhuman Porphyrias are useful to investigate disease pathogenesis \nand to develop new therapies. AIP model is a knockout mouse with \ntargeted disruption of PBG-D that exhibits the typical biochemical/\nneurological characteristics of human AIP. The aim was to evalu -\nate heme metabolism, hepatic damage and oxidative parameters \nin a genetic AIP model compared to wild type strain ( C57BL/6 ). The \nstudy was performed in liver and brain using three groups (males \nand females): Wild type, T1 (PBG-D activity 55% reduced) and AIP \n(PBG- D activity 70% reduced. T1 and AIP PBG-D activity was ac -\ncording to the model in liver;  in brain it was also reduced (40-50%, \np<0.01) without differences  between both genotypes. As was ex -\npected, 5-Aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity,  heme regulatory \nenzyme, was elevated in liver (T1: 140%, p<0.01;  AIP: 45%, p<0.05) \nand brain (T1: 257%, AIP: 95%, p<0.05)  in both genotypes. Heme \noxygenase (HO), involved in heme catabolism,  was  100% (p<0.05) \nhigher than wild type in brain in  both sexes and genotypes, being he -\npatic HO only induced in  females (50-100%, p<0.05). HO alteration, \nGSH variation and Catalase reduction (140%,  p<0.05) would indi -\ncate stress oxidative instauration. Glutathione S-Transferase, hepat -\nic damage  marker, varied depending on the genotype. Tryptophan \npyrrolase activity, pool  regulatory heme marker, was elevated in liver \nand brain (87-140%,  p<0.05) of AIP female. Considering that aging \nis a significant  risk factor for impaired tissue functions and chronic \ndiseases, alterations  in the measured parameters were evaluated \nthroughout life, using animals  12-15 months old; no major variations \nwere observed. In conclusion,  the present study has demonstrated that the differences among wild  type and genetic models were more \nstriking in AIP genotype  respect to T1 and age did not affect signifi -\ncantly the metabolisms analyzed.\nNANOMEDICINA\n355.

Nanotechnology rep -\nresents a strategy to improve current therapies. The aim of this work \nis to develop amorphous silica nanoparticles(SiNPs) as carriers for \ndrugs involved in TNBC. Synthesis, physicochemical characteriza -\ntion and evaluation on the viability of TNBC cell lines of two SiNPs \nformulations were performed: amino-functionalized SiNPs(Si@NH2) \nand SiNPs modified with folic acid(FA) (Si@FA). Modified St\u00f6ber \nprocess was applied to obtain Si@NH2. FA was covalently linked \n(Si@FA). Characterization was performed by FTIR and DLS to de -\ntermine hydrodynamic diameter(Hd).  Viability assays by crystal vi -\nolet staining were performed in human MDA-MB-231, murine 4T1 \nTNBC cell lines and in non-malignant murine breast HC11 cells (10 \n- 500 \u03bcg/mL SiNPs, 24 h).  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) gener -\nation was determined by DCDCDHF assay in MDA-MB-231 cells \n(500 \u00b5g/mL SiNPs). A pilot in vivo assay was conducted in mice \nto evaluate SiNPs acute toxicity: 30 mg/kg of Si@NH2, Si@FA or \ncontrol were administered weekly for 1 month. FTIR spectra con -\nfirmed functionalization with NH2 and FA; Hd resulted as 643.7 nm \nand 600.0 nm respectively. Si@FA displayed a significant reduction \nof the viability of MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 TNBC cells. Si@NH2 de-\ncreased 4T1 cell viability (p<0.001) although no effect was found for \nMDA-MB-231 cells at any of the concentrations tested. Both NPs \nincreased ROS production with respect to control (Si@FA: p<0.001; \nSi@NH2: p<0.01) and between them (p<0.001). Regarding to HC11 \ncells, NPs had no effect on viability. The observation of the inter -\nnal organs of the animals showed no macroscopic alterations; no \nchanges in hematocrit, behavior and body weight were observed. \nAltogether, these results suggest that Si@FA could be a promising \nnanotechnology for TNBC treatment. Further studies are in course \nto evaluate their effects in combination with conventional drugs.\n356.

This work is meant as a preliminary screen -\ning for the development of improved delivery and bioavailability of \nvitamin C systems.\nMaterials and methods : Phosphatidylcholine from sunflower (H100), \nCholesterol (Chol) and ascorbic acid (AA). H100, H100-Chol, H100-\nAA and H100-Chol-AA liposomes were prepared. Zeta potential \n(ZP), size and conductivity  measurement of liposomes was deter -\nmined with a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 equipment. Anton-Paar DSA \n5000 was used to get continuous and automatically, densities (\u03c1) \nand sound velocities (u). ABSTRACTS187\nResults : ZP curves as a function of temperature showed that the \nmost negative surface charge was that of the H100 Chol system, \nwith positive surface charges for the others. H100 and H100-Chol \nconductivities were the lowest measured and were found to be \nvery close to each other. H100 AA y H100 Chol AA systems had \nthe highest conductivities. Particle size was 150 nm for H100 Chol \nAA liposomes, 200 nm for H100 AA liposomes and 250 nm for H100 \nand H100 Chol and remained constant. The lower specific volume \nof H100-Chol-AA liposomes in comparison with H100 membranes \nmay be indicative of a more compact lipid bilayer structure for the \nformer. Specific compressibility values for H100 Chol AA and H100 \nwere similar. \nConclusions : Ascorbic acid encapsulated in sunflower phosphatidyl -\ncholine liposomes shows well-organized morphology, uniform par -\nticle size, which might lead to an improved bioavailability. It could \nresult to be a good alternative to protect and transport vitamin C in \nthe body.\n357.

The aim of the present work was \nthe design of biocompatible and non-toxic hybrid pectin (P) nano -\nstructured lipid carriers (NLC) containing geraniol (GOH), a mono -\nterpene with antitumor activity, as a novel platform for the bioactive  \ndelivery of anticancer drugs.\nNanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by hot homogenization/ultra -\nsonication method.  Different pectin formulations were prepared by \nmodifying their amount (0.1  and 0.5%, w/v) in the formulation and/or \nmetoxilation degree -Low  (LMP, 33%) and high (HMP, 74%). Ten dif -\nferent formulations were  prepared: NLC/GOH, NLC/LMP0.1/GOH, \nNLC/LMP0.5/GOH, NLC/HMP0.1/GOH, NLC/HMP0.5/GOH,  and \ntheir respective counterparts without GOH. NPs were characterized \nby TEM microscopy and DLS: particle size, z-potential (z-pot), and \npolydispersity  index (PI). The encapsulation efficiency (EE) was de -\ntermined by UV-Vis  spectroscopy. Cell viability (MTT) and mitochon -\ndrial membrane potential (MMP, fluorescence  spectroscopy) in hu -\nman lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were evaluated. NPs  showed \nspherical shape, sizes in the range of 110-180 nm with  narrow distri -\nbution (PI< 0.3), and negative z-pot ranging from\n-10 to -19 mV.  The EE of GOH was higher than 89% in five  formula -\ntions. GOH-loaded NLC inhibited A549 cell viability in a dose  (0.25- \n2.00 mM) and time (24 and 72 h) dependent  manner. GOH-loaded \nNLC decreased cell viability up to 10-fold compared to free GOH \n(GOH 1.5 mM, 24 h, p< 0.001). In addition, GOH-loaded NLC \nstrongly decreased (p< 0.001) MMP (50 to 94%) in comparison with \nfree GOH (37%) in A549 cells. These results suggest that hybrid \nNLC/P nanoparticles containing GOH  are promising bioactive and \ninnovative systems for targeted delivery of antineoplastic drugs to \ntreat lung cancer.\n358.

Triple \nnegative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype, associat -\ned with poor prognosis. The standard treatment regimen for TNBC is \nbased on the administration of highly toxic chemotherapeutic drugs \n(anthracyclines/taxanes). Paclitaxel (PTX) is a first-line therapy for \nTNBC and has low water solubility, poor permeability, and produces \nsevere adverse effects, which limit its clinical use. The aim of this \nwork was to improve the therapeutic index of PTX through the de-\nsign of combined strategies. For that purpose, we developed nano -\nmicellar polymeric formulations of Soluplus\u00ae (S) and Soluplus\u00ae sur -\nface decorated with glucose residues (SG) co-loaded with histamine \n(HA, 5 mg/mL) and PTX (4 mg/mL). The micellar size, evaluated by \ndynamic light scattering, showed a hydrodynamic diameter between \n80 and 100 nm for loaded nanoformulations with a unimodal size \ndistribution. Cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays were performed to \nassess their efficacy in vitro in human MDA-MB-231 and murine 4T1 \nTNBC cells. Results showed that histamine improved the antitumor -\nal activity of free PTX and Genexol\u00ae (commercial micellar-based \nPTX- nanoformulation) at low concentrations (0.01-0.1  uM) in both \ncell lines (P<0.05). HA-PTX co- loaded SG  micelles exhibited en -\nhanced cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects compared to PTX  loaded \nSG micelles, Genexol\u00ae, and free PTX (P<0.05).\n99mTc-radiolabelled S and  SG micelles\u2019 distribution was analyzed \nusing gamma camera imaging in  the TNBC model developed in \nBALB/c mice with 4T1 cells,  showing tumor uptake. Importantly, the \nin vivo studies showed that histamine,  both in combination with free \nPTX and in the HA-PTX  loaded SG micellar system, reduced cardio -\ntoxicity associated with PTX administration.  We conclude that hista -\nmine enhances the efficacy of nanotechnology based  PTX therapy, \nrepresenting a promising approach for TNBC treatment.\n359.

In a previous work \nwe developed an inhalatory formulation of CUR encapsulated in \narchaeolipid nanovesicles, called nATC, and a conventional formu -\nlation of liposomal CUR, nLTC. While nATC had excellent stability \nagainst nebulization and long-term storage, nLTC released CUR \nafter 1 month of storage and partially lost its CUR content during \nnebulization. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate nATC \nas a photosensitizing agent to be used in an inhalatory photodynam -\nic therapy (PDT) against lung cancer. We studied cytotoxic effects of \nnATC, nLTC and free CUR on A549 cells -a human lung adenocarci -\nnoma cell line-, after irradiation at 420 nm with a fluence of 9 J/cm2. \nFirst, we determined cell proliferation by MTT 24 h after irradiation \nand obtained an IC50 of 3.7 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcM, 4.9 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcM and 8.5 \u00b1 1.6 \n\u03bcM for nATC, nLTC and free CUR, respectively. Cells were labeled \nwith Annexin V/Propidium Iodide 6 h after irradiation and it was de -\ntermined that only nATC induced apoptosis (12.5 \u00b1 3% of cells ana -\nlyzed by flow cytometry), while free CUR only induced necrosis (18 \n\u00b1 2%). 24 h after irradiation, all formulations induced LDH release \nand complete depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. \nFurthermore, nATC and CUR completely inhibited cell migration 96 \nh post irradiation, whereas nLTC did not. Finally, only nATC was able \nto completely inhibit the activity of matrix metalloproteinases. These MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021188\ndifferential effects of nATC could be explained by 1) the higher cy -\ntoplasmatic CUR content within the cells and 2) the higher concen -\ntration of ROS and nitric oxide detected after nATC irradiation. We \nconcluded that nATC outperformed liposomal CUR and free CUR \nmaking it a good candidate for inhalatory PDT that deserves further \nstudy to determine its anti-angiogenic activity and immunomodula -\ntory effects.\n360.

Size represents a crucial parameter in terms of internalization \nand disruption of blood cells. In this work, SiNPs were synthesized \nby St\u00f6ber method with modifications, varying the amounts of water \nand ethanol; temperature and time of reaction as variables determi -\nnant of size. Besides, SiNPs were modified by treatment with NaOH \nto generate pores in the surface for future pharmacological pros -\npects. The SiNPs obtained were characterized by FTIR spectrosco -\npy to evaluate qualitative composition; by DLS to determine hydro -\ndynamic diameter (Hd) and zeta potential to infer surface charge. \nHemolytic activity, LDH levels and oxidative stress were studied. Ex -\nposure to SiNPs was conducted by mixing NPs dispersed in isotonic \nsaline solution of NaCl 0.9% at concentrations of 1000, 500, 250, \n100 and 50 \u00b5g/mL with healthy human blood, during 1h. Positive \ncontrols were processed. Free hemoglobin was determined by UV \nspectroscopy.  LDH levels were studied employing a commercial \nkit. Evaluation of oxidative stress was conducted by TBARS deter -\nmination. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed SiO2 as main component of \nNPs. All formulations obtained resulted monodisperse with Hd near \n200nm with negative surface charge. \nResults have not evidenced changes in erythrocytes lysis in com -\nparison to control (p<0.001). No changes were observed in cytolo -\ngy. LDH levels were registered as normal for all formulations at the \nconcentrations tested. TBARS assay demonstrated the induction of \noxidative stress at concentration of 500 \u00b5g/mL, in special for pore \ninduced SiNPs formulation. \n200nm sized SiNPs obtained did not induce significant alterations in \nthe parameters observed for the study of hemocompatibility. Howev -\ner, the induction of oxidative stress was observable as dose depen -\ndent for concentration of 500 \u00b5g/mL.\n361.

The average size, \nsurface area and isoelectric point was 125 nm, 471 m2g-1 and 2.4, \nrespectively. A suitable range of concentrations of NFX-MMSiO2 [16 \n\u00b5g/mL, 8 \u00b5g/mL, 4 \u00b5g/mL, 2 \u00b5g/mL] was seeking to the minimum \ninhibitory concentrations known by NFX. Microdilution inhibitory \nassay was conducted for  of MMSiO2, NFX-MMSiO2 and NFX. The \nsamples were incubated for 18h at physiologic temperature of 37\u00b0C \nand absorbances were measured in a Multiskan GO VWR Co Mi -\ncroplate Spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific. The results were \nstandardized subtracting the absorbances of the vehicle and data \nwere statistically analyzed.The evidence suggested differences in the inhibitory activities de -\npending on NFX-MMSiO2 concentrations when compared to NFX.   \nAt low doses, the major prevalence of growth decrease was ob -\nserved for NFX-MMSiO2 in comparison to the same doses of the \nantibiotic, whereas at higher concentrations of NFX-MMSiO2 the \neffect decreased in comparison to free NFX. There was exposed a \ndecline in the inhibitory growth activity of NFX according to its mini -\nmum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in contrast to MMSiO2 which ac -\ntivity remained constant.   It was also observed that MMSiO2 did not \npresent a direct effect on the bacteria. However, these NPs could \nhave enhanced the antibiotic effect at lower doses. This fact may be \ndue to the outcome of iron from the NPs and to changes in the ionic \nforce of growing medium. \nResults demonstrate that loading NFX into MMSiO2 would be a \nstrategy to target the drug to specific sites in the organism under \nthe influence of an external magnetic field, at low concentration to \nensure a better performance in comparison to free NFX.\n362.

We aimed to \nvalidate these results using EVs isolated by affinity chromatography, \na scalable method. \nMethods: HUCPVC were infected with adenoviruses codifying for \nhuman IGF1 (AdIGF1) or green fluorescence protein (AdGFP). Via -\nbility was determined by MTT assay. IGF1, TNF- a, and CD63 levels \nwere determined by ELISA. EVs were isolated from HUCPVC su -\npernatants by anion exchange chromatography and characterized \nby electron microscopy. Expression of pro-fibrogenic genes (Co -\nl1A2 and aSMA) on hepatic stellate cells (LX2) were determined by \nqPCR. Antifibrotic effect of EVs was determined in BALB/c mice with \nliver fibrosis (thioacetamide for 8 weeks). The treatments were ad -\nministered on week 6 (Groups: Saline, EVs-AdIGFI or EVs-AdGFP, \n3 doses, 15 \u03bcg/dose/mice every 5 days).\nResults: First, we found that HUCPVC infected with 2.5 to 30 MOI \nshowed over-expression of IGF1, keep cell viability and exert an \nanti-inflammatory capacity on J774 macrophages revealed by de -\ncreased TNF-\u03b1 expression (p<0.0001 vs LPS). HUCPVC-derived \nEVs isolated by chromatography showed typically size, shape, and \nCD63 expression. Increased IGF1 levels were observed on lysed-di -\nalyzed EVs-AdIGFI indicating its loading on EVs (p<0.001). Pro-fi -\nbrogenic genes expression was reduced in LX2 cells after treatment \nwith IGF1-loaded EVs (p<0,01 vs. DMEM). In vivo  treatment with \nEVs-AdIGF1 resulted in a further amelioration of liver fibrosis when \ncompared to saline group (p<0,001). \nConclusion: Our results showed that EVs-AdIGF1 isolated by a \nchromatographic scalable method carry IGF1 and keeps anti-fibrotic \nactivity. This data provides a novel approach of nanomedicine to \ngenerate therapeutic tools for the treatment of iver fibrosis.\n363.

UBA-CONICET\nShiga toxin type 2 (Stx2) is the main virulence factor of Shiga toxin \nproducing Escherichia coli and is responsible for triggering Hemo -\nlytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). We aimed to develop and charac -\nterize polymeric nanomicelles (PN) with the amphiphilic polymer \nSoluplus\u00ae coupled to anti-Stx2 IgG in order to introduce innovative \nproposals for the detection of Stx2 and treatment of HUS. PN of \nSoluplus\u00ae were formulated in PBS and coupled with IgG anti Stx2 \nfrom hyperimmune (PN-IgG-Stx2) or control bovine colostrum (PN-\nIgG-Ctrl). The hydrodynamic size of PN, PN-IgG-Stx2 and PN-IgG-\nCtrl was evaluated by Dynamic Light Scattering. Morphology of PN \nor PN-IgG-Stx2 was analyzed by Transmission Electron Microscopy \n(TEM). The PN toxicity was evaluated on both Vero and Human Glo -\nmerular Endothelial cells (HGEC) and cell viability was determined \nby neutral red uptake. After coupling PN with IgG, Stx2 neutralization \ncapacity of PN-IgG-Stx2 or PN-IgG-Ctrl was evaluated on Vero and \nHGEC cells and the percentage of cell viability was analyzed. The \nhydrodynamic size of the PN of Soluplus\u00ae and IgG-Stx2 showed an \naverage diameter of 70.2 \u00b1 1.5 nm and 40.9 \u00b1 2 nm, respectively. \nWhen both components were coupled, a single peak with a similar \nhydrodynamic size of the PN was observed (70.4 \u00b1 0.2 nm). TEM \nanalysis revealed circular particles with a diameter corresponding to \n100 nm either in PN and PN-IgG-Stx2 particles. PN-IgG-Stx2 were \nable to neutralize Stx2 on Vero and HGEC cells in a dose dependent \nmanner. When comparing the neutralization capacity of Stx2 by IgG-\nStx2 vs PN-IgG-Stx2 a significant improvement in the cell viability \nof Vero and HGEC was observed with the PN-IgG-Stx2 (p<0.001). \nThe association between anti-Stx2 IgG from bovine colostrum and \nSoluplus\u00ae PN was optimized and characterized. Encouraging re -\nsults of antibody functionality coupled with PN were registered. \nThese results may open the perspective of the design of new nano -\nplatforms for neutralization and/or detection of Stx2.\n364.

These vectors \nmake possible to improve the biodistribution of fragile or complex \nmolecules and favor their interaction with specific tissues. Antioxi -\ndant compounds are of great interest since uncontrolled production \nof free radicals has been related to several diseases. The aim of \nthis work was to obtain fungal enriched protein extracts with antiox -\nidant activity and to adsorb them on silica NPs in order to evaluate \ntheir antioxidant potential. To achieve this goal, P. ostreatus  and A. \nbisporus  fruiting bodies were homogenized, centrifuged and the su -\npernatants were treated with ice cold ethanol to precipitate soluble \nproteins. The precipitates were resuspended in buffer and enriched \nproteins extracts were obtained. Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were \nsynthesized by the St\u00f6ber method and a portion of these were graft -\ned with APTES to add amino groups to their surface, obtaining mod -\nified SiNPs (SiNPsNH2). Both variants of NPs were characterized \nby TEM, DLS and Z potential. These NPs of spherical form were a \nhomogeneous population of diameter 110 \u00b1 10 nm. Fungal extracts \nwere incubated with NPs at 40 rpm and 4\u00b0C overnight to allow the \nproteins adsorption on the NPs. Antioxidant activity was evaluated \nusing ABTS radicals generated by the reaction of ABTS and potas -\nsium persulfate overnight at room temperature in the dark. For the assay, samples were incubated with the radical ABTS for 30 min in \nthe dark and the absorbance was measured at 734 nm. The results \nshowed that a high amount of the proteins of A. bisporus  extracts \nwere adsorbed on both SiNPs and SiNPsNH2, while P. ostreatus  \nproteins were not adsorbed. But only A. bisporus  proteins-SiNPs \ncomplex presented significant antioxidant activity. Therefore, this \ncomplex is of interest to be studied as a possible therapeutical tool.\n365. (372) TITLE:  ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECT OF AR -\nCHAEOLIPID NANOPARTICLES ON HUMAN ENDOTHE -\nLIAL CELLS\nChar\u00f3 N1, Jerez H2, Tatti S3, Romero2* E, Schattner M1*.\n1 Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX-CONICET-ANM), \nBuenos Aires, Argentina.\n2 Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Desarrollo en Nanomedicinas \n(CIDEN), Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Buenos Aires, \nArgentina.\n3 Departamento de Obstetricia y Ginecolog\u00eda, Hospital de \nCl\u00ednicas, Buenos Aires Argentina.\nBackground:  New generation of liposomes called archaeosomes \n(ARC) are nanoparticles (NPs) made of archaeolipids employed \nas drug delivery systems that exhibit high structural stability. So far \nthere are no reports on the effects of ARC on human vascular endo -\nthelium, critical data for their eventual clinical use. \nAim:  The present study investigated the effects of archaeosomes \non human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in physiological \nand under inflammatory conditions and compared them with con -\nventional liposomes. \nMethods: HUVECs were non-stimulated or stimulated with LPS, \nPam3CSK4, E. coli,  TNF-\u03b1, or IL-1 \u03b2 in the absence or presence \nof nanoparticles. We analyzed cell viability and apoptosis (acridine \norange/ethidium bromide), cell proliferation (EdU assay), expression \nof ICAM-1 and E-selectin (cytometry), secretion of IL-6 and von Wil -\nlebrand Factor (vWF) (ELISA), mRNA expression of ICAM-1 and \nvWF (RT-qPCR), uptake of NPs (cytometry and confocal microsco -\npy) and signaling pathways (cytometry and western blot). Results \nwere analyzed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test (p<0.05, n=4-\n6). \nResults:  None of the NPs affected the viability, cell proliferation, and \nexpression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin under basal conditions, but \nARC reduced the expression of both molecules and the secretion of \nIL-6 induced by LPS, Pam3CSK4 or E.coli , an effect not observed \nwith TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1 beta. Interestingly, ARC significantly decreased \nbasal vWF levels and the increase induced by all stimuli. None of \nthese parameters were modified by the liposomes. Only archaeo -\nsomes were endocytosed by HUVECs and reduced mRNA expres -\nsion of ICAM-1 and vWF via NF-kB and ERK1/2 in LPS-stimulated \nHUVECs.\nConclusions:  Our data show that archaeosomes exert an anti-in -\nflammatory effect on endothelial cells. Loaded with anti-inflammato -\nry drugs, they could magnify their activity on inflamed endothelium, \nand therefore their research in vasculopathies is of special interest.\n366. (434) IMPACT OF PHOTOTHERMAL THERAPY USING \nGLUCOSE-FUNCTIONALIZED GOLD NANOPARTICLES \nIN HUMAN LUNG CANCER CELLS\nJuan Braga Menendez1,3, Mar\u00eda Fernanda Cardinal2, Mariana \nMalvicini1\n 1 Cancer Immunobiology Laboratory, Facultad de Ciencias \nBiom\u00e9dicas, Instituto de Investigaciones en Medicina Trasla -\ncional (IIMT), CONICET-Universidad Austral, Av.

MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021190\nAdditionally, most patients are diagnosed in advanced stages, re -\nstricting their therapeutic options. Nanoparticles-based photother -\nmal therapy has been studied as a low toxic and feasible treatment \nfor solid tumors in the recent years. In this work, we synthetized gold \nnanoparticles (AuNPs) in the forms of rods, spheres and stars and \nanalyzed the in vitro toxicity of AuNPs, polyethylene glycol-(PEG-\nAuNPs) and glucose-functionalized AuNPs (GlucAuNPs) on human \nlung carcinoma cells. Also, we evaluated the ability of cancer cells \nto uptake each type of GlucAuNPs and assessed the capability of \nirradiated N-GlucAuNPs to induce thermal damage.  From our re -\nsults, we detected that AuNPs toxicity significantly decreases when \nthey were functionalized with PEG, in comparison with as prepared \nAuNPs (p<0.001). Importantly, the viability of A549 cells was com -\npletely preserved when AuNPs were functionalized using glucose \n(GlucAuNPs). Quantification of cellular uptake by inductively cou -\npled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) shown that GlucAuNPs \nwere more incorporated by A549 cells than PEG-AuNPs.  In order to \nevaluate in vitro, the efficiency of GlucAuNPs for photothermal ther -\napy, we irradiated A549 with a 980 diode laser at 1 W and identified \nthat GlucAuNPs plus laser had an antiproliferative effect and inhibit -\ned tumor cell viability compared to laser or GlucAuNPs without irra -\ndiation (p<0.001). In addition, similar studies on normal fibroblast in -\ncubated with GlucAuNPs did not shown photothermal damage. Our \nfindings exhibit that glucose functionalization of AuNPs improves the \nuptake of nanoparticles by cancer cells and selectively induces loss \nof viability and cellular death. We suggest that our approach can be \nused to develop new tools for advanced lung cancer.\n367.

In addition, OMVs \npossess both defensive and protective functions and thus partici -\npate in community related functions.  Our goal was to character -\nize and look for the presence of genes associated with RAM in the \nOMVs from three relevant resistant strains, E. coli  SM5 that belongs \nto pandemic lineage ST131,  E. coli  M19736 that harbors mcr-1 , and \nP. aeruginosa  PAE981 that belongs to epidemic clone ST2867. In \naddition, we evaluated if these OMVs could protect other bacteria \nagainst a membrane-active antibiotic, such as colistin. To character -\nize OMVs 1) total quantification of OMVs was performed using the \nMicro BCA Protein Assay Kit, 2) the images of OMVs was obtain by \ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM), and 3) we estimated bio -\nphysical characteristics using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). \nFinally, by PCR assay we looked for genes associated with RAM. \nNTA results showed a size between 100\u2013300 nm in diameter. PCR \nassays allowed us to detect in the OMVs from SM5 the blaCTX-M-15 \ngene, from M19736 the mcr-1  gene, and from PAE981 the blaVIM-2 \ngene. Chemical, electro and natural transformation was performed \nfor SM5 using the OMVs from M19736. The colonies obtained were \nevaluated by PCR for the presence of mcr-1 . The three transforma -\ntion assays with a strain that was previously susceptible to colistin, \nshowed colonies which then were able to survive to this antibiot -\nic without acquiring mcr-1 . Therefore, we propose that the OMVs \nisolated from M19736 could protect SM5 from colistin. The present \nstudy shows an efficient isolation method in different bacterial gen -\nera that allows the detection of genes associated with RAM by PCR \nin OMVs. Also, the results obtained indicate that OMVs have a dual \nimpact on the generation of antimicrobial resistance, both through \nhorizontal genetic transfer and through a protective physical effect \nin clones with epidemic behavior.\n368.

Nano -\nstructured lipid carriers (NLC) are the second generation of lipid \nnanoparticles that were developed to overcome these drawbacks. \nIt has been reported that riboflavin (RFV) receptors show up-regu -\nlation in many tumor cells, so RFV could be an efficient ligand for \ntumor-specific drug delivery. RFV, also known as vitamin B2, was \nfunctionalized in the NLCs to study actively target tumor cells. The \ndrug 8-hydroxyquinoline platinum(II) (8HQ-Pt) loaded, RFV-target -\ned NLC of myristyl myristate (MM) (RFV-8HQ-Pt-NLC) were syn -\nthesized by ultrasonication. Cytotoxicity, cell uptake, and apoptosis \nassays against the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 \nwere studied. The NLCs with spherical shape and narrow size distri -\nbution in the range of 136-162 nm mean particle diameter and 75% \nencapsulation efficiency were shown. RFV-8HQ-Pt-NLC exhibited \nbetter cytotoxicity than the untargeted-NLC (8HQ-Pt-NLC) and the \nfree 8HQ-Pt (2.8-fold and 3.8-fold, respectively at 5 \u00b5M). RFV-8HQ-\nPt-NLC 3.2-fold more efficiently incorporated into HT-29 cancer cells \nat 2.5 \u00b5M in comparison to 8HQ-Pt-NLC. Also, RFV-8HQ-Pt-NLC \nshowed higher levels of apoptosis than the free 8HQ-Pt at 2.5 and \n5 \u00b5M. As a conclusion, we showed that RFV targeting improved \nthe antitumoral activity of NLC. Ligand-targeted nanosystems offer \npromising results in the future of chemotherapy.\n369.

The principal problems related to the use of injectable \napproved formulations of TA include particle size (>1\u00b5m), which can \nhinder the administration, and also the presence of excipients as \npreservatives, which can generate cell damage. The purpose of this \nwork was to obtain a formulation based on triamcinolone acetonide \nnanocrystals (TA-NCs) to improve ocular corticosteroid therapy.\nMaterial and Methods:  The microsphere assisted nanomilling \n(MAN) followed by spray-drying (SPA) techniques were used to ob -\ntain dried TA-NCs, which were characterized by studies of dynam -\nic light scattering (DLS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy \n(FTIR), thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Electron mi -\ncroscopy (SEM). Preliminary studies of anti-inflammatory efficacy of \na suspension of dispersable TA-NCs via subconjunctival route (n=5) \nwere carried out in an endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) rabbit model \nand compared with a control group (normal saline solution). \nResults : Dispersable TA-NCs presented an average particle size of \n(266\u00b177) nm; a narrow size distribution and zeta potential of (-27\u00b11) \nmV,  which remained stable during 30 days under storage conditions \nat 4 \u00b0C. TA-NCs showed uniform and spherical morphology (SEM). \nFTIR and XRD spectra showed no apparent chemical and crystal -\nlinity changes, while no apparent thermal changes were revealed by \nthermal analysis. The subconjunctival administration of TA-NCs in ABSTRACTS191\nalbino male white rabbits did not show clinical signs of ocular dam -\nage. In vivo  preliminary studies showed that dispersable TA-NCs \ntreatment alleviated the inflammatory response in the anterior cham -\nber and iris in EUI rabbit eyes. \n Conclusion : Dispersable TA-NCs are a promising approach to ob -\ntain a novel nanometric TA formulation for ocular disorders. \n370.

However, free BR is hydrophobic and susceptible to oxidation. \nIn this work we encapsulated BR in PA archaeosomes (ABR) and \nstudied its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity compared with \nthe one of nanovesicles made of soybean phosphatidylcholine and \nBR (LBR).\nABR (135 \u00b1 48 nm, -50 \u00b1 18 mV Z-potential and 9,6 \u00b5g/mg phospho -\nlipids/BR rate) protected BR from light and high temperatures effect \nas antioxidant activity remained unchanged after incubation at 80\u00ba \nand room temperature without protection. This activity was lost in LBR \n(154 \u00b1 35 nm, -13 \u00b1 3 mV Z-potential and 6,9 \u00b5g/mg phospholipids/\nBR rate). In murine macrophages cells we found that even though \nno high antioxidant activity was found in studied conditions, there is \na remarkable anti-inflammatory activity as ABR reduced the release \nof pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF- \u03b1 induced by LPS (compared \nwith the one of A without BR). \nIn conclusion, A was able to protect BR, even in hostile conditions, \nallowing future application and enabling its antioxidant and anti-in -\nflammatory activity.\n375. (577) NANO-MATCHA: NOVEL NANOVESICLES CARRY -\nING EGCG FOR DRY EYE DISEASE \nGonz\u00e1lez, Victoria; Morilla, Maria Jose; Higa, Leticia; Rome -\nro, Eder \nNanomedicine Research and Development Center, Quilmes \nNational University\nDry eye disease (DED) is an ocular surface disease that exhibits \ninflammation and oxidative stress. Hyperosmolarity at the level of \nthe tear film surface, uncontrolled levels of reactive oxygen species \n(ROS) and pro-inflammatory stress lead to apoptosis of  epithelial \ncornea cells. Antiinflammatory agents (steroids and cyclosporine A), \nhormonal therapy, antibiotics, nerve growth factors, essential fatty \nacids are used as treatment options of DED. Current therapies at -\ntempt to reduce the ocular discomfort by producing lubrication and \nstimulating gland/nerve(s) associated with tear production, without \nproviding a cure for dry eye. Besides, eyes drops are associated \nwith poor drug bioavailability due to transient contact time and ra -\npid washout by tearing. Thus, it is necessary to overcome these \ndrawbacks.The objective would be to develop nanovesicles made from Haloru -\nbrum tebenquichense total archaeolipids, which contain PGP-Me a \nligand for scavenger receptors class A and bacterioruberin the high \nantioxidant carotein with the incorporation of green matcha tea ex -\ntract (nano-matcha). Thus, nano-matcha would achieve and main -\ntain remission of acute inflammatory episodes and reduce ROS at \nbaseline levels for topical administration. EGCG, one of the main \ncatechins extracts of green tea, provides an inhibitory effect on the \ninflammation and ROS some studies demonstrated that green tea \nextract reduces the expression of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 through \ninhibition of NF-kB activation, and suggested that green tea may \nbe useful to prevent or ameliorate diseases associated with inflam -\nmatory cytokines overexpression and stress oxidative on corneal \nepithelial cells1,2 Firstly, catechins of green matcha tea (GMT) were \nextracted using ethyl acetate followed by washing citric acid to deca -\nffeine3. The extraction yield obtained was 73,2 mg \u00b1 4,9 g catechins/\nGMT. We showed the presence of EGCG, a highly fluorescent mole -\ncule at 353 nm4 in the extract using a spectrofluorometer. Lightless \nthin-layer chromatography (TLC) method using Chloroform:Metha -\nnol:Distilled Water (65:35:10, v/v/v) as the mobile phase was deve -\nloped and revealed using UV-light and Iode fumes. RF values for \nEGCG and catechin standards were similar to the extract. Besides, \nHPLC method was developed using a C18 column and mobile pha -\nse composed of acetonitrile, acetic acid and water (6:1:193 v/v/v) to \ndetermine and quantify EGCG in the extract of catechins5. EGCG \nwas the main component of the extract. Nanosized, monodispersed \nand negative z potential in EGCG nano-matcha were obtained. A \nlower inhibitory concentration providing 50% reduction of the DPPH \nradical (IC50) in nano-matcha (the activity enhanced by co-encap -\nsulation) than EGCG was obtained. Onwards, anti-inflammatory and \nantioxidant activity of nano-matcha on corneal and macrophage cell \nlines and a 3D ocular model will be tested.\nReferences\n1. Cavet, M. E., Harrington, K.

Pa \ninfections, together with chronic airway inflammation, diminish the \nquality of life of patients who often require aggressive treatments \nthat frequently fail to eradicate the infection. Thus, development of \nnovel therapeutic strategies is urgent. We developed NAC eoT-TB, \na formulation that combines the broad spectrum antibiotic tobramy -\ncin (TB) and Thymus vulgaris  essential oil (eoT) -which has anti-in -\nflammatory and antioxidant properties- delivered by nanostructured \narchaeolipid carriers (NAC). NAC eoT-TB (195 \u00b1 15 nm, -39 \u00b1 4 \nmV), were structurally stable after nebulization, an important feature \nfor an efficient delivery to the lungs by inhalation route.  \nThe use of essential oil as pharmaceutical ingredient can be limit -\ned by its high volatility. However, the incorporation of eoT into NAC \neoT-TB decreased its evaporation rate 1.7 times after 24 h at room \ntemperature. On the other hand, while the viability of bacteria in es -\ntablished Pa biofilm was reduced in a similar degree by NAC eoT-TB \nand free TB, the former significantly decreased the biomass of the \nbiofilm (86 \u00b1 11% vs 39 \u00b1 59%, respectively, at 18 \u00b5g/ml of TB). At \nthese concentrations, NAC eoT-TB did not significantly reduce the ABSTRACTS193\nviability of human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549), neither hu -\nman macrophages (THP1). Also, A549 cells stimulated with 1 \u00b5g/ml \nLPS showed an improved antioxidant activity at 182 \u00b5g/ml eoT de -\nlivered by NAC eoT-TB which reduced 96 \u00b1 7% of ROS generation, \nwhereas free eoT reduced only 61 \u00b1 51%. In addition, the incubation \nof THP1 with NAC eoT-TB significantly diminished the release of \nproinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1. In summary, these results indicate \nNAC eoT-TB has improved antibiofilm, antioxidant and anti-inflam -\nmatory activity compared to free eoT and TB, and therefore it may \nbe a successful approach to combat Pa infections.\n377.

The radical scavenging activity of BET has been associated \nwith several health benefits including anticancer properties. BET is \nalso the most abundant component of the processed beetroot ( Beta \nvulgaris ) juice. Chitosan (CS) is a food grade, biocompatible and \nnon-toxic biopolymer used as encapsulation material by virtue of its \nreactive -NH2 and -OH groups along the molecule. In this work we \nhave purified BET from beetroot juice by means of size exclusion \nchromatography (sephadex LH-20) and encapsulated into CS by \nionic gelation method. The purified BET fractions were analysed by \nTLC (Thin Layer Chromatography) and UV-visible spectroscopy and \ncompared with standard commercial BET. Spectroscopy analysis \nshowed that BET has a prominent presence in the purified fractions. \nFrom 51,5 \u00b1 2,6 mL of juice/100 g of beetroot we obtained 54 \u00b1 13 \nmg of purified BET/mL of juice. Purified BET was lyophilized and \nincorporated into CS solutions (0,7 % w/w, pH 5.5) by using tripoly -\nphosphate (TPP; 0,6 % w/w, pH 9.0) as crosslinking agent. A max -\nimum encapsulation efficiency (42 \u00b1 6 %) was reached when using \nthe 3:1 CS/TPP relation (w/w). The mean size of nanoparticles (NP) \nwas 239 \u00b1 17 nm assessed by DLS (Dynamic light Scattering), with \na low polydispersity index (0,322 \u00b1 0,004) and was dependent on a \nprevious ultrasonication step to prevent aggregation. The stability in \nwater (pH 5.0) of NP-loaded BET was observed throughout several \ndays. On the contrary, a fast liberation of BET occurred in the PBS \nbuffer (pH 7.0), showing differential retention properties depending \non vehicle and pH conditions. These preliminary results show that \nBET-CS-TPP NP could be suitable nanocarriers for BET protection \nand delivery. The maintenance of BET antioxidant properties after \nincorporation into NP and their biomedical applications should be \ndetermined further. \n378.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible not only for the tumor initiation, but also for its pro -\ngression and recurrence. CSCs are quiescent cells that overexpress \nmitochondrial related proteins, thus disruption of mitochondrial ac -\ntivity may represent a new approach for the elimination of CSCs. \nNanotechnology improves cancer therapy and reduces its adverse \neffects by specifically delivering drugs to tumor tissues.\nIn this work we present a nanotechnology strategy for targeting \nCSCs, using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) conjugated with doxycycli -\nne (DOXY), an inhibitor of mitochondrial biogenesis.\nInitially, the in vitro effects of free DOXY were studied using radio -\nsensitive (A375) and radioresistant (A375-G10 and Mel-J) melano -\nma cell lines. All cell lines displayed a significant reduction on cell \nviability and metabolic activity at concentrations above 25 \u00b5M of \nDOXY, being the radioresistant cells more affected. Also, radiosen -\nsitization was evaluated by clonogenic assays in A375- G10 cells \nirradiated with a gamma rays source (137Cs). At 1 Gy survival frac -\ntion was reduced from 60% on control to 28% on those pre-treated \nwith DOXY.\nWe propose different strategies to produce the nanoconjugates. \nFirstly, DOXY- AuNPs were synthesized using DOXY as a reducer \nand stabilizer agent in alkaline conditions. Secondly, AuNPs were \nobtained by a traditional Turkevich method, and a polymer-DOXY \nconjugate was attached. Hydrodynamic diameter measured by DLS \nwas 15 nm for DOXY-AuNPs and 36 nm for traditional synthesized \nAuNPs, with a strong absorption band by UV-Visible spectroscopy \nat 520 nm and 525 nm, respectively.\nWe are currently working on determining the effects of these na -\nnosystems on proliferative activity and clonogenic capacity of the \ncell lines. These preliminary results suggest the possibility of con -\ntrolling melanoma resistant cells using a mitochondria targeted the -\nrapy.\n379.

Sgc8c is an aptamer \nthat recognizes the PTK7  receptor, described as a tumor target that \nhas been previously studied by  our research group, as a molecular \nimaging probe. In this  work, we studied the optimization of Sgc8c \ndelivery, as well  as its stability, using linear and branched polymeric \nmicelles (PMs),  based of PEO-PPO-PEO copolymers: poloxamer \nF127\u00ae and poloxamines T1307\u00ae  and T908\u00ae. For it, Sgc8c-(CH2)6-\nNH2 was conjugated to Alexa647 fluorophore (Sgc8c-ALEXA, \nprobe) and its co-association with different PMs was exhaustively \nanalyzed. The majority size-populations of Sgc8c-ALEXA-PMs \nwere between 11 and 32 nm at 25\u00baC by Dynamic Light Scattering \n(DLS). Zeta-potentials were moderately negative in all cases.

Innate and adaptive immunity have been linked to HSS. \nEmerging evidence supports the concept that immune cells are acti -\nvated promoting inflammation and exacerbating disease.\nAim: to study in this HSS model if the increase in pressure is accom -\npanied by the immune system (IS) cells infiltration in renal tissue, \nand to evaluate the expression of the CD4 + and CD8 + in peripheral \nblood lymphocytes (PBL) of intact female (IF) and oVx rats with a \nnormal (NS) or high sodium (HS) diet.\nMethods: At 60 days of life, half of the rats were ovariectomized, \nand at 145 days IF and oVx rats were divided into NS (0.24% NaCl) \nor HS (1% NaCl in drinking water) subgroups. At day 150 systolic \nblood pressure (SBP, tail-cuff method) was recorded and the ani -\nmals were sacrificed. Previously, blood samples were taken for PBL \nseparation. Expression of CD4 and CD8 was analyzed by Western \nBlot. Kidney histology was analyzed in hematoxylin-eosin stained \nsections, and common leukocyte antigen (CD45) was analyzed by \nimmunohistochemistry.\nResults: SBP (mmHg), IF NS: 126 \u00b1 3.1, IF HS: 127 \u00b1 7.1, oVx NS: \n127 \u00b1 3.0, oVx HS: 142 \u00b1 7.3*. \n* p <0.05 oVx HS vs all other groups. CD4 expression of PBL in IF \nHS is lower respect to IF NS (p <0.001), while in oVx HS it is higher \nrespect to oVx NS (p <0.01). CD8 increased in only oVx HS respect \nto the other groups (p <0.05). The presence of CD45 was found only \nin the renal cortex of oVx HS rats.\nThe increase in CD4 and CD8 could indicate an activation and prolif -\neration of IS in HSS promoting the infiltration of cells in key tissues. \nThe response of the IS to the HS diet is different according to the \nhormonal context, which is a key point to understand the progres -\nsion of the disease.\n381.

Hospital Misericordia, C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina.\nWe have previously reported that during an inflammatory or infec -\ntious stimulus, cells sense the hypoxic environment and release to the extracellular milieu large amounts of ATP, which functions as a \npro-inflammatory metabolite driving the nature of the immune re -\nsponse. The purinergic ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73, metabolize \nextracellular ATP into adenosine, an anti-inflammatory mediator. \nThese purinergic pathways have been studied in the context of met -\nabolic diseases related to kidney damage, but their role in the type \nII diabetes mellitus (T2DM) nephropathy have not been completely \nestablished.\nThe objective of the present work was to study the role of CD73 \nin the development of diabetic nephropathy employing mice devoid \nof CD73 activity (CD73KO) and controls B6 (WT). To this aim, we \ndeveloped two murine models of T2DM, feeding the mice with me -\ndium fat diet (17%) and water 20% fructose (model A) and high fat \ndiet (60%) (model B) for 22 weeks, combined with a single dose of \nstreptozotocin (65-100mg/kg). \nIn both models, at the end of treatment, blood glucose levels were \nhigher than 190mg/dl; but, in model A KO animals gained signifi -\ncantly less weight compared to the WT (p=0,0043). In model A, both \nmouse strains showed comparable renal damage parameters, such \nas a decrease in diuresis and a loss of more than 50% of glomerular \nfiltration rate as well as significantly higher values of microalbumin -\nuria (pWT=0,0327, pKO=0,0500), and plasma creatinine (pWT=0,0159, \npKO=0,0159). In contrast, in model B, diabetic KO mice show signs \nof improvement with a significant correction of diuresis (p=0.0346), \nalbuminuria (p=0.0303) and proteinuria (p=0.0043) compared to di -\nabetic WT. Furthermore, plasma and urinary creatinine from diabetic \nKO mice did not show significant differences respect to healthy KO \n(p=0.556, p=0.9667). In conclusion, the results suggest that CD73 \nactivity could have a protective role in the development of diabetic \nnephropathy in a diet dependent manner.\n382.

Facultad Medicina, UBA.\nShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli  causes acute renal failure \nand Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome. We have previously shown that \nan intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a sublethal dose of Shiga toxin 2 \n(Stx2) produced polyuria, increase in serum creatinine, renal necro -\nsis and induced tubular cell proliferation in female rats with water ad \nlibitum . Vimentin, is expressed in metanephric mesenchyme but not \nin tubules of mature kidneys, and it is reexpressed in renal epithelial \ncells during recovery from acute injury. The aim of our work was to \nstudy the effects of a sublethal dose of Stx2 on renal function, urine \noutput, and tubular epithelial regeneration in female Sprague-Daw -\nley rats. Rats (250g) were i.p. inoculated with 0.5ng Stx2/g body \nweight (bw) (St) or diluent (Ct). At 4 days post-injection (dpi), rats \nwere placed in metabolic cages during 16 h under water deprivation. \nBlood and urine samples were collected to determine urinary flow \n(Uv), serum creatinine (SCr) and serum urea (Surea). Rats were then \neuthanized and kidneys were removed to evaluate vimentin and \nKi67 (proliferation marker) expressions by immunofluorescence. St \nrats showed a significant increase in Uv (9 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5l/min x 100g bw), \nSCr (8.9 \u00b1 0.68 mg/l) and Surea (54.5\u00b1 2.84 mg/dl), compared with Ct \nrats (Uv:  3 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5l/min x 100g bw; SCr: 6.5 \u00b1 0.69 mg/L; Surea: 36.5 \u00b1 \n2,64 mg/dl) (p<0.01). A significant increase in Ki67 and vimentin ex -\npression was observed in renal medulla tubular cells of St rats with \nrespect to Ct rats (p<0.01). About 18% of vimentin positive tubular \nepithelial cells colocalized with Ki67. In conclusion, Stx2 sublethal \ndose produced alterations on renal function and polyuria, similar to \nwhat we have previously observed in rats with water ad libitum  at 4 \ndpi. On the other hand, vimentin and Ki67 expression suggest the \nreparation of the tubular epithelia after moderate damage caused \nby Stx2. \nNEUROCIENCIAS\n383.

Ipsilateral EZ \nshowed lower GMRV values comparing contralateral structures in \nTLE and FLE patients (p<0.05). In TLE, impulsivity positively cor -\nrelated with GMRV in ipsilateral entorhinal cortex (EC) (p<0.05). \nHigher BDI-II scores positively correlated with GMRV in EC, fusiform \ngyrus (p<0.05).\nIn ELF, impulsivity correlated positively with GMRV in both amyg -\ndalas and contralateral transverse temporal gyrus and rectus gyrus \n(p<0.05).

Jun\u00edn 956, 2do piso, \n(C1113AAD) Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nBinge-drinking is the most common alcohol-related disorder whose \ndirect consequence is known as alcohol hangover (AH). This one \nis defined as a combination of mental and physical symptoms ex -\nperienced the day after a single episode of heavy drinking, start -\ning when blood alcohol concentration (BAC) approaches zero. We \ndemonstrated that AH induced strong oxidative stress, mitochondrial \ndysfunction and alterations in nitric oxide (NO) metabolism through \nthe impairment of NMDAR/PSD-95/nNOS pathway in brain cortex \nsynapses. \nThe aim of the present work was to study apoptotic signaling path -\nways in brain cortex at the onset of AH. Swiss male mice received \nan i.p. injection of ethanol (3.8 g/kg body weight, AH group) or saline \n(control group) and were sacrificed 6h afterwards (BAC=0). Deter -\nminations were conducted in mitochondria and lysates from brain \ncortex. \nImpairment of calcium handling and MPT induction were observed \nin AH mitochondria (p<0.05) together with a 21% increase and 18% \ndecrease in Bax and Bcl-2 protein expression (p<0.05) respectively. \nMoreover, a 4-fold decrease in cytochrome c mitochondria/cytosol \nratio was found due to AH (p<0.01). In addition, citrate synthase, a \nmitochondrial enzyme marker, was 40% decreased in AH mitochon -\ndria (p<0.05). Interestingly, AIF protein expression was unchanged \nby AH. Caspase 3 and 9 activity and expression were increased by \napproximately 30% and 18-19% respectively (p<0.05) in brain cor -\ntex lysates from AH. In addition, although non-significant, p53 was \nfound 14% increased in AH brain cortex (p=0.057). Lastly, SIRT-1, a \nhistone deacetylase which promotes mitochondrial biogenesis was \n63% decreased (p<0.01). \nIn conclusion, alcohol after-effects could result in the activation of \nintrinsic apoptotic pathways due to mitochondrial dysfunction and \noxidative stress. Also, non-mitochondrial apoptotic processes can \nbe triggered during AH due to the blockage of calcium entry at syn -\napses after disruption of NMDAR/PSD-95/nNOS pathway. \n386.

(056) MODULATION OF INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS OF \nMATERNAL IMMUNE ACTIVATION BY RESVERATROL\nJulia Ticchi, Fernando Correa \nCONICET, Laboratorio de Neuroinmunolog\u00eda, CEFyBO, Fa -\ncultad de Medicina, UBA\nMaternal immune activation (MIA) produces structural, metabolic \nand epigenetic changes in the fetus associated with increased risk \nfor various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. \nThe hallmark of brain neuroinflammation is the activation of microg -\nlia, one of the main effectors of the innate immune response in the \nCNS. Excessive microglial activation leads to CNS damage due to \nexcessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators, like interleuk -\nins, MMP, PGE2, NO and ROS.\nIt has been demonstrated that resveratrol has anti-inflammatory, \nantioxidant and epigenetics properties that translate into neuropro -\ntective effects in adults.\nObjectives : To study the possible neuroprotective effects of resver -\natrol in the fetal CNS in a model of MIA induced by bacterial lipopoly -saccharide (LPS) and to determine the pro-inflammatory mediators \ninvolved in the modulation of the response.\nResveratrol was administered to Balb/c females on gestational day \n15, which were then exposed or not to LPS. After LPS administra -\ntion, amniotic liquid was collected to evaluate activity of MMP2 and \nMMP9. Additionally the brain of the offspring were collected to eval -\nuate the expression of two inducible enzymatic pathways (COX-2 \nand iNOS) that produce mediators (prostaglandins and nitric oxide) \nknown to cause inflammation and to evaluate the acetylation of H3 \nand H4 since DNA acetylation is associated with the regulation of \ninflammatory gene expression.\nResults: \nPreliminary results show that the LPS-triggered MIA induces COX2 \nexpression in the fetal brains (p <0.05 respectively) while resveratrol \nprevents this effect. Regardless to the activation of iNOS and the \nacetylation of H3 and H4 we couldn\u2019t see any significant variation \nbetween the different treatments.\nOn the other hand, LPS we observed that LPS decreases MMP2 \nwhile Resveratrol induces MMP9 in the amniotic fluid.\nConclusion:  Maternal immune activation increases COX2 expres -\nsion in fetal brains.\n389. (082) GENISTEIN AMELIORATES NEUROINFLAMMA -\nTION IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS OF MALE SPONTANEOUS -\nLY HYPERTENSIVE RAT (SHR)  \nSantiago Ronchetti 1, Florencia Labombarda 1,2, Paulina Roig \n1, Alejandro F.

Facultad de Medicina UBA\n \nHippocampal neuropathology is a recognized feature of the sponta -\nneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Previous studies have found abnor -\nmalities in the hippocampus of SHR consisting of decreased neu -\nrogenesis and increased astroglial and microglial reactivity. These \nabnormalities are reversed by exogenous administration of estra -\ndiol, an active neuroprotective and hypotensive factor. Also, these \nhippocampal alterations are associated with cognitive impairment. \nGenistein (GEN) is a phytoestrogen which binds to ER\u03b2 and GPER \nand it is known to have neuroprotective actions. We have recently \ndemonstrated that GEN exerts neuroprotective actions,  increases \nneurogenesis, decreases astrogliosis and also improves hippocam -\npal dependent memory.\nTo further investigate if this phytoestrogen exerts neuroprotective \neffects in hypertensive encephalopathy, we focused on neuroinflam -\nmation. We treated 5 month old SHR (BP>180 mm Hg) during 2 \nweeks with 10mg/kg daily s.c injections of GEN. We measured the \nexpression of IBA1+ microglia in the CA1 region and hilus of the hip -\npocampus by immunocytochemistry and classified microglia accord -\ning to its morphology. Furthermore, we evaluated the expression of \npro-inflammatory (COX-2) and anti-inflammatory (TGF\u03b2) factors by \nreal-time PCR. We found that while ramified microglia predominat -\ned in normotensive rats, SHR presented an increased proportion \nof the hypertrophied phenotype. GEN produced a shift in microglial \nphenotypes towards a ramified type. Furthermore, GEN treatment \ndecreased expression of the pro-inflammatory factor COX-2 and in -\ncreased the expression of the anti-inflammatory factor TGF\u03b2\nOur results indicate that GEN was able to exert direct neuroprotec -\ntive actions ameliorating neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of \nSHR. These data, along with previous data of GEN improvements \non neurogenesis, astrogliosis and memory deficits, opens an inter -\nesting possibility for proposing this phytoestrogen as an alternative \ntherapy in hypertensive encephalopathy.  \n390. (088) NEUROGENESIS IS REGULATED THROUGH THE \nCLASSICAL PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR DURING \nAGEING. \nJuli\u00e1n Del Core1, Ignacio Jure1, Alejandro F De Nicola1,2 and \nFlorencia Labombarda1,2\n1 Laboratorio de Bioquimica Neuroendocrina, Instituto de \nBiolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental-CONICET, 2 Departamen -\nto de Bioqu\u00edmica Humana, Facultad de Medicina, UBA. ABSTRACTS197\nA new role has emerged for progesterone after discovering its po -\ntent actions away from reproduction in both the central and the pe -\nripheral nervous system. Progesterone effects beyond reproduction \ninclude myelin formation, neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory ac -\ntions and neurogenesis regulation. Despite the fact that the precise \nmechanism of Progesterone actions is controversial, most studies \nsupport a role of the progesterone classical receptor (PR) in those \nactions. Given that during ageing hippocampal neurogenesis de -\ncreases, oligondendrocytes die and neuroinflammation is enhanced \ndue to reactive gliosis, we decided to study whether progesterone \ncan regulate these parameters in the aged PR knock out mouse \n(PRKO). This strain is depleted of both PR isoforms (PRA and PRB), \nas shown by postnatal genotyping. Five month, one and two year \nold PRKO and wild type mice (WT) were analysed by immunohis -\ntochemistry. Neurogenesis was assayed by identifying doublecortin \n(DCX) positive immature neurons in the subgranular zone of the \ndentate gyrus of the hippocampus using stereologic methods. In the \ncourse of the time analysed, neurogenesis decreased as expected \ntherefore, the lowest number of DCX + cells were found in the 2 \nyear old mouse (p<0.0001, 2 year vs 1 year and 5 month old mice). \nRegarding the PR receptor, there was a decrease in the production \nof new neurons in the PRKO mouse at all ages analysed (p<0.05 \nPRKO vs WT for 5 month, p<0.001 PRKO vs WT for 1 and 2 year \nold mice). Our results suggest that Progesterone is required during \nadulthood and ageing to support an age-dependent level of neu -\nrogenesis. Furthermore, Progesterone effects on this parameter is \nacting through its classic nuclear receptor. \n391.

It was also demonstrat -\ned that 2-AG metabolism can be modulated by its own receptors. \nMoreover, phytocannabinoids (PC) present in Cannabis extracts \n(CE), have been proposed as neuroprotective agents and are be -\ning used in several studies to treat neurodegenerative processes. \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate if THC present in CE could \nmodulate 2-AG hydrolysis by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). To \nthis end, delta-9-tetrahydrolcannabinol (THC) enriched CE were ob -\ntained from Cannabis Y Griega female flowers, previously grinded \nand heated 115\u00b0C for 40 min. Extractions were performed by add -\ning 5% (w/v) ethanol, vortexed, sonicated and agitated. The mixture \nwas centrifuged and the supernatant was evaporated under stream \nof N2. THC, cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabinol (CBN) were quan -\ntified by HPLC. CC syn from adult (4-6 months) and aged (24-26 \nmonths) rats were isolated by differential centrifugation and purified \nin ficoll gradients. MAGL activity was assessed by incubating syn \nwith either THC enriched CE (10-3-50 \u03bcM THC) or 1 \u03bcM pure THC, \nand [3H]-MAG, simultaneously. It was observed that CE containing \n1 \u03bcM THC decreased MAGL activity in aged (p=0.0166) but not in \nadult syn (p>0.05). However, 1 \u03bcM pure THC failed to modulate \n2-AG hydrolysis (p>0.05). This findings, could suggest that THC \nenriched CE could attenuate the deregulation of 2-AG metabolism \nobserved in aging, and that this effect could only be generated when \nsyn are exposed to the PC in the presence of the entire CE.\n392.

Besides, outer hair cells (OHC) excit -\nability is under control of the efferent neurons of the Medial Olivo -\ncochlear (MOC) system. In response to overstimulation, MOC cho -\nlinergic neurons activate the calcium-induced K+ channels BK and \nSK2, which extrude K+ out of the cell repolarizing the membrane. In -\ntracellular accumulation of K+ leads to  a chronic depolarization that \nmay damage hair cells causing hearing loss (HL). KCNQ4 activity \nimpairment  is the main cause of DFNA2, a non-syndromic progres -\nsive HL.  Using a mouse model lacking Kcnq4 ( Kcnq4-/- ), we report -\ned that OHC death begins at the basal turn progressing to the apex  \nin 3-6-week-old (W) animals. We hypothesized that the KCNQ4 ab -\nsence  causes MOC chronic overstimulation leading to activation of \ndeath pathways.  Using immunofluorescence (IF), we evaluated the \nMOC terminals and observed  a lower synaptic density and mislo -\ncalization of the efferent terminals  contacting OHC in 4W Kcnq4-/- \nmice. In addition, we analyzed by qPCR the gene expression of the \nefferent components located in the MOC terminals. We detected a \n~3.5-fold decrease in the mRNA expression of the nicotinic recep -\ntor \u03b110 subunit with no changes in the \u03b19 subunit, and a ~8-fold \ndecrease in the mRNA expression of BK and SK2 in 4W Kcnq4-/- \nanimals. Finally, we studied the possible pathways involved in  OHC \ndeath. By IF, we found an increase of cleaved-caspase  3 expression \nin the OHC at the basal turn and  gene expression analysis by qPCR \nrevealed that the pro-apoptotic Bax transcript was upregulated while \nanti-apoptotic Bcl2 was downregulated in Kcnq4 -/- mice. These  re -\nsults  demonstrate an alteration of the efferent transmission in OHC \nthat could contribute to the activation of the apoptotic pathway driv -\ning to OHC death.\n393.

Astrocyte pathological con -\nversion with a pro-inflammatory gain of function involves dramatic \nand stable transcriptomic changes, probably following activation of \ntranscription factor NF-kB. NF-kB interacts with chromatin remodel -\nling enzymes and recruits them to regulatory regions of target genes \npromoting epigenetic changes in other cell types.\nWe aim to address the epigenetic mechanisms that are associated \nwith NF-kB activation in reactive astrocytes that might lead to the \nestablishment of an astrocyte pathological identity.  \nUsing immunofluorescence microscopy and PCR analysis in pri -\nmary cultures of mouse cortical astrocytes with different microglia \nabundance and exposed to pro-inflammatory stimulus LPS (Lipo -\npolysaccharide), we observed that LPS significantly promoted: 1) \nSequential NF-kB activation in microglia>>astrocytes together with \nmorphological and transcriptional changes, 2) A variable intensity of \ninitial NF-kB activation in astrocytes depending on microglial abun -\ndance and the release of microglial soluble factors and 3) A microgli -\nal-dependent increase in gene activating histone marks H3K9K14ac \nand H3K27ac and a decrease in the repressive mark H3K9me3. In \nvivo brain ischemia recapitulated the increase in H3K27ac specifi -\ncally in reactive astrocytes from ischemic penumbra and inhibition of \nhistone deacetylases exacerbated astrogliosis and brain damage.\nOur results showing changes in histone mark abundance are high -\nly indicative of chromatin remodeling events in a subpopulation of \npro-inflammatory reactive astrocytes. Such epigenetic mechanisms \nmay represent plausible therapeutic targets to reduce astrocyte \npro-inflammatory phenotype, neuroinflammation and neuronal loss \nafter brain injury.MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Using the lithium-pilocarpine rat model of TLE \nwe previously showed that neurodegeneration, reactive gliosis and \nmacrophages brain infiltration occur during the LP and that early \ninterventions limiting immune activation during the LP increase epi -\nleptic threshold during the chronic phase (Rossi et al., 2013; 2017). \nThe model consists of the administration of lithium-pilocarpine (127 \nmg/kg /30 mg/kg, 20h apart) to male Wistar rats. Animals develop \nStatus Epilepticus (SE) that mimics human IPE and SE is limited \nto 20 min by 20 mg/kg i.p. diazepam. In this work, we have found \nmorphological evidence of early spleen white pulp activation 1 day \npost SE (DPSE), while increased CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocytes in \nthe choroid plexus, without changes in the gut-associated lymphoid \ntissue (GALT), followed by a decreased abundance of na\u00efve lym -\nphocytes in blood and spleen smears were found at 2-3DPSE.\nIn order to evaluate the relevance of the spleen-brain inflammato -\nry coupling in the LP that follows pilocarpine-induced SE, we per -\nformed splenectomy (n=6) to 210-220 g male Wistar rats anesthe -\ntized with ketamine-xylazine (90 mg/kg/10 mg/kg) 1 week before the \nlithium-pilocarpine treatment. Sham animals were used as controls. \nOur loss of function studies showed that splenectomy decreased as -\ntrogliosis, neuroinflammation and deep cervical lymph nodes size at \n7DPSE.

However, reactive as -\ntrocytes can suffer a pathological remodeling that is detrimental for \nneuronal survival. We have previously shown that Toll-like recep -\ntors (TLR) pathway play a key role in the astroglial proinflammatory \nphenotype induced by LPS. However; the spatio-temporal clues, \nthe localization of pathologically remodeled astrocytes and wheth -\ner the TLR/NFkB pathway is involved, are unknown facts. Using a \nmodel of traumatic brain injury (TBI) by performing a cortical stab-\nwound lesion (2 mm posterior and lateral to Bregma; 1 mm depth) \nin C57BL/6 mice; we evaluated the spatio-temporal distribution of \nsix GFAP+ astroglial phenotypes described by Sholl analysis. At \n1DPI astrocytes were similar to the non-injured hemisphere (type \n0, resting astrocytes), while highly hypertrophied astrocytes (type \nV) significantly increased at 3-7DPI and were surrounded by degen -\nerating neurons with altered NeuN distribution. At longer recovery \ntimes (14-28DPI) type V population was reduced concomitantly with \nreduction of altered neurons. Microgliosis was also present, starting \nat 1DPI and peaking at 7DPI. Interestingly, decreased expression of \nhomeostatic AQP4 channel was determined at 7DPI compared to \n3DPI. Also, we observed a decreased exploratory activity by open \nfield assay at 7DPI compared to 3DPI. Stimulation of TLR pathway \nby administering LPS (5 mg/Kg i.p) resulted in a larger number of type V astrocytes with a population of proinflammatory C3+ astro -\ncytes, increased microgliosis associated with a decreased survival \nneuronal at 7DPI. Loss of function achieved by administration of the \nchemical NFkB blocker sulfasalazine (150 mg/kg i.p) significantly \nreduced astrogliosis, microgliosis, and neuronal death at 7DPI. We \nconclude that an exacerbated astrogliosis is associated with neuro -\nnal impairment and behavioral deficit and the TLR/NFkB pathway \nis involved in this pathological astroglial conversion.

Rat pups (10-11 days old) were placed in a glass \nchamber, and their core temperature was raised by a regulated \nstream of heated air (39-42\u00b0C). Body temperature was measure at \nbaseline, seizure onset and every 2 min during the seizures. Hy -\nperthermic temperatures (39.5-42\u00b0C) were maintained for 30 min. \nThe seizures onset was monitored behaviorally, and consisted of \nan acute sudden arrest of hyperthermia-induced tonic freeze pos -\ntures and occasional oral automatism (biting and chewing) and often \nbody flexion. Rats were then placed on a cool surface, monitored \nfor 5 min before being returned to their mothers. At 35 days old rats \nwere deeply anesthetized, fixed and brains and spleen processed \nfor histological techniques, immunohistochemistry and morphomet -\nrical studies. We observed that there was a significant increase in \nthe proinflammatory phenotypes of Iba-1+ microglia in males while \nfemales showed a decrease in the area occupied by Iba-1+ cells. \nCortical neurons presented altered NeuN+ profiles in layer II of CP, \nbeing more prominent in females. Both sexes showed an activation \nof the white pulp, evidenced by an intense disorganization of Mal -\npighi corpuscles. Our results strongly suggest that males are more \nsusceptible to HS exposure and this could be related to their future \nsusceptibility to develop epilepsy.

We previously determined that \nhighly complex astroglial phenotypes are associated with neuro -\ntoxic-proinflammatory astrocytes. Using the AD rat model McGill-R-\nThy1-APP that expresses the human amyloid-beta precursor protein \n(AbetaPP) with Swedish and Indiana mutations, we studied by im -\nmunohistochemistry the progression of reactive astrogliosis and the \naccumulation of human Abeta (hAbeta) in male and female hetero -\nzygous transgenic rats of 7 and 13 months old (7mo; 13mo). Ex-vivo \ncultures of transgenic or wild type hippocampal explants were also \nused. Our results showed that transgenic rats have intracellular hA -\nbeta accumulation at 7mo, while extracellular hAbeta plaques occur \nat 13mo. Significant differences in hAbeta accumulation between \nmales and females were not observed. Interestingly, reactive astro -\ncytes were present in the 7mo animals and image analysis showed ABSTRACTS199\nstatistically significant increased area of astrocytes, which persisted \ninto the 13mo group. The reactive gliosis induction at 7mo animals \nwas confirmed in the ex-vivo cultures that showed a significant in -\ncrease in stellated GFAP+ astrocytes. Sholl analysis showed that \nastroglial profiles are not statistically different between transgenic \nand wild type males or females at 7mo. However, at 13mo Sholl \nanalysis defined three different astroglial cell populations in male \ntransgenic rats, with increasing complexity determined by their lo -\ncalization: plaque astrocytes>periplaque>distant. Interestingly, dis -\ntant astrocytes recapitulated Sholl profiles of wild type animals and \nmales showed increased complexity and size in their astrocytes. \nWe conclude that the three different astroglial phenotypes may rep -\nresent different cell populations and further studies will attempt to \ncharacterize the gene expression profile in these groups. \nSupported by PUE 2018 (IBCN), UBACYT and PICT 2019-0851      \n398.

Is the leading \ncause of non-traumatic neurological disability among young adults \nand there is no definitive treatment for it. Its etiology is not abso -\nlutely clear, but Herpesvirus  infection, Epstein Bar virus (EBV) in \nparticular , has been suggested as an environmental factor associat -\ned with MS risk and severity. We sought to compare antibody (Ab) \ntiters against EBV, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Varicella Zoster \nvirus (VZV) between MS patients and healthy controls (HC) from \nArgentina and to characterize EBV polymorphisms associated with \ndisease risk.\nSerology was assessed in 146 MS patients and 129 HC by indirect \nELISA (Vircell).\nIn a subset of MS cases, EBV EBNA-2 and vIL-10 genes were am -\nplified and Sanger sequenced and RNAseq was performed in EBV+ \nand EBV- sorted B cells.\nAll MS patient and HC were IgG positive for EBV and VZV, while \n60% of the HC and 71% of the MS patient were seropositive for \nCMV. A significant difference was found between HC and MS pa -\ntients for EBV-VCA titer (P<0.01) and CMV Ab titer (P< 0.05). RNA -\nseq of cell-sorted EBV+ B cells showed down-regulation in IQGAP1 \nmRNA, a B cell proliferation regulator molecule, in comparison to \nEBV- B cells. Sequencing of EBNA-2  revealed  a CTC insertion at \nnucleotide position 633 in 5/8 MS samples but not in HC (0/4). No \nMS specific polymorphisms were found in vIL-10 gene (12 MS sam -\nples vs 8 HC).\nMS is a complex disease with strong interaction between genetic \nand environmental factors, and different Herpesviruses may have \nan effect on MS pathology, as suggested by differences in titers for \nEBV-VCA and CMV Ab, RNAseq results and an EBV EBNA-2 gene \nvariant potentially linked to MS patients. Further work is needed to \nvalidate sequencing results and confirm this association. \n399. (192) DICER ACTIVATION REDUCES LPS-INDUCED \nPROINFLAMMATORY PATHOLOGICAL REMODELING \nOF ASTROCYTES IN VITRO\nSoledad Donna, Alejandro Villarreal, Veronica Murta, Alberto \nJavier Ramos\nIBCN UBA-CONICET, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de \nBuenos Aires\nAstrocytes undergo molecular and morphological changes in re -\nsponse to acute injury or chronic pathologies of the Central Ner -\nvous System (CNS) in a process called reactive gliosis. Reactive astrocytes may suffer a pathological remodeling with proinflamma -\ntory gain-of-function that facilitates neurodegeneration. Strategies to \nprevent this conversion are important to prevent secondary neuronal \ndeath in different CNS pathologies. Repurposed drugs such as Met -\nformin and Enoxacin have shown neuroprotective effects in different \nexperimental models and, although their mechanisms of action are \nvery different, they share the ability to induce miRNA processing \nenzyme Dicer. Here, we pre-incubated primary glial mixed cultures \ncontaining astrocytes and microglia for 24 h with Metformin (MET, \n10-30 mM) or Enoxacin (ENO, 50 \u00b5M), and then we exposed them \nto 25 ng/ml Lipopolissacharide (LPS), a molecule that is a power -\nful inducer of astroglial pathological remodeling. Astroglial and mi -\ncroglial morphology were analyzed at 6 and 24 h using immuno -\nfluorescence microscopy and Image analysis. Nuclear localization \nof the p65 NFKB subunit was evaluated as a parameter of NFKB \nactivation by immunostaining (p65/GFAP/DAPI or p65/Iba-1/DAPI). \nOur results showed that 30 mM MET or 50 \u00b5M ENO significantly \ndecreased LPS-induced NFKB activation and reduced reactive gli -\nosis in this in vitro paradigm. Although the effect was significative in \nboth astrocytes and microglia, astrocytes showed a trend to be more \nsensitive to MET and ENO effects. Expression of proinflammato -\nry cytokines (IL-1B, TNFa) was also significantly reduced by MET \ntreatment. Although the detailed molecular mechanisms involved \nhave not been elucidated yet, we speculate increased Dicer activity \nis probably expanding the repertoire of astroglial anti-inflammatory \nmiRNA and future work will attempt to identify these miRNA expand -\ned by MET and ENO treatments.

Commonly, patients suffer a worsening in \ntheir pathological condition as a consequence of neuroinflamma -\ntion, a cellular response in which astrocytes and microglia are major \nplayers. Astrocytes respond to injury through a phenomenon known \nas reactive astrogliosis showing functional and phenotypic changes \nthat are stable in time. We have recently shown that pro-inflamma -\ntory stimulus with lipopolysaccharide leads to increased levels of \nacetylated histone 3 in astrocytes suggesting that chromatin remod -\neling events might modulate reactive pro-inflammatory phenotype. \nIn this work we aim to study possible changes in histone modifi -\ncations at early time points after brain ischemia since such events \nmay \u201cprime\u201d astrocytes for acquisition of specific reactive pro-in -\nflammatory phenotype. We exposed Wistar male adult rats to a \nunilateral ischemic brain injury by cortical devascularization and \nanalyzed abundance of histone modifications in astrocytes using \nfluorescence microscopy and labelling with specific antibodies to \ndetect astrocytes (anti-GFAP) and acetylated histone 3 (anti-H3ac). \nWe observed a significant decrease of acetylated histone 3 in the \nischemic \u201ccore\u201d region. A similar result was observed in immuno -\nblots from primary cultures of astrocytes exposed to oxygen and \nglucose deprivation. Contrarily, penumbral astrocytes surrounding \nthe ischemic core showed increased levels of histone 3 acetylation. \nInterestingly, broad histone deacetylase inhibition with valproic acid, \nimmediately after onset of injury, promoted exacerbated astrogliosis \nand neuronal death at longer time points.   \nOur results indicate that reactive astrocyte epigenetic changes after \nbrain focal ischemia are regionally-dependent and that overriding \nthat fine tunned control with hyperacetylation by VPA increases neu -\nroinflammation and expands neuronal death.  \nGrants: UBACYT, FONCYT, ISN-CAEN, APBIOTECH\n401.

Leukoaraiosis (L) is related to the small cerebral vessel \ndisease and mainly associated with aging, dementia, hypertension, \ncognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease (AD). The aim of this \nresearch is to evaluate whether OS and OD are associated with \ninflammatory response in L and AD patients. Biomarkers of OS, \nOD and inflammation were evaluated in 33 ageing patients: 17 with \ndiagnosis of L (magnetic resonance imaging and brain computed \ntomography) and 16 with AD (neurological and cognitive tests), and \nhealthy subjects (controls, n=17). The following parameters were \nassessed in plasma: protein oxidation measured as carbonyl groups \n(CO), phospholipid oxidation, measured as the content of thiobar -\nbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), interleukin 6 (IL-6), total \nantioxidant (TRAP) and protein content; and in red cells: protein \ncontent, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. A 100% in -\ncrease of TBARS was observed in L (p<0.001) and AD (p<0.01), \nwhereas CO was increased 60% (p<0.05) and IL-6 (52%, p<0.05) in \nAD. Total hydrosoluble antioxidants (TRAP) and proteins were not \naffected in plasma. In red cells, the antioxidant enzyme activities of \nSOD was increased in both L (3-fold, p<0.001) and AD (2.5-fold, \np<0.01), while in L catalase increased 3-fold (p<0.05) and protein \ncontent decreased 24% (p<0.01). These results indicate that in age -\ning patients, with differential diagnosis of dementia and cognitive im -\npairment, lipid oxidation and activation of the antioxidant response \nfor the detoxification of the superoxide anion are common mecha -\nnisms in L and AD. In L, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposition \nis associated with a decrease in the content of total proteins in red \nblood cells, while in AD, the excess of H2O2 cannot be degraded and \nwould be responsible for lipid and protein oxidation associated with \ninflammatory response.\n402. (214) STABLE CHANGES IN GLOBAL DNA METHYLA -\nTION IN REACTIVE ASTROCYTES FROM ANIMALS EX -\nPOSED TO EXPERIMENTAL TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEP -\nSY (TLE)\nGomez DD1, Rossi A1, , Murta V1, D\u00b4Alessio L, Ramos AJ1\n1. IBCN UBA-CONICET, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad \nde Buenos Aires\nNeuron-centric literature considers epilepsy as the result of an al -\nteration of excitatory/inhibitory balance; however a growing body of \nevidence shows the glial role in this disease. Usually, TLE patients \nrefer a initial precipitating event (IPE), followed by a silent period of \nlatency before initiating chronic seizures. We hypothesize that IPE \nreleases DAMP that produce the alteration of astroglial proinflam -\nmatory and homeostatic genes during the latency period, and that \nlong lasting effects are due to epigenetic cues. In the present work \nwe used the Lithium-Pilocarpine model of TLE (Li-Pi Model) in male \nWistar rats that were analyzed at 3, 7, 21 or 35 days post-status \nepilepticus (DPSE). Status epilepticus mimics the IPE events in hu -\nmans. In vitro, astrocyte enriched culture were exposed to DAMP \n(HMGB-1) or PAMP (LPS) to induce a proinflammatory burst that \nimitates an in vivo IPE. Using immunohistochemistry, quantitative \nimage analysis and RT- PCR, we observed that animals present -\ned a long-lasting increase in global methylation in astrocytes (from \n7 to 35DPSE) and coexisted with an increase in the DNMT3a/\nDNMT1 mRNA expression. A concomitant reduction of homeostat -\nic astroglial Kir4.1 and glutamine synthetase (GS) expression were \nalso observed during the latency period. In vitro, acute exposure \nto DAMP or PAMP was able to recapitulate the in  vivo profile, by \nproducing long- lasting increased global methylation, reactive gliosis and decreased expression of homeostatic genes in the astroglial \ncultures. The increased global methylation in astrocytes was also \nconfirmed in hippocampal sections resected from TLE patients. We \nconclude that long-lasting astroglial alterations during the latency \nperiod induce a profound disbalance in neuronal homeostasis and \nK+ buffering that contributes to  increased neuronal excitability. The \naltered pro-epileptogenic astroglial profile is sustained  by increased \nglobal methylation of these genes. Supported by PICT  2017-2203 \nand 2019- 0851.\n403.

Among other effects, \nApoE4 has been associated with alterations in mitochondrial dynam -\nics. In order to learn about the effects of ApoE4 on neuronal cells, we \naimed at purifying the recombinant protein expressed in E. coli  and \nassaying it on mitochondria of a neuronal clonal cell line, CNh. E. coli  \nBL21 strain expressing the ApoE4 (pET32-E43C, containing His and \nTrx-tags) and 3C-protease were grown in LB medium and induced \nwith 1 mM of IPTG for 1.5 and 4 h at 37 and 30C\u00ba, respectively. \nCrude soluble ApoE was purified by affinity chromatography using a \nNi-NTA resin. The 3C-protease was purified by FPLC (Superose-12 \nsize exclusion). ApoE4 and 3C-protease were incubated at 4\u00baC in a \n25:1 ratio to release the His-Trx tag. ApoE4 was next purified by size \nexclusion chromatography, with a yield of ~5 mg/L without dena -\nturing/renaturing steps and no apparent contaminant bands in SDS \npolyacrylamide gels. We next studied mitochondrial morphology in \nneuronal CNh cells using confocal fluorescence microscopy.

Mitochondrial morphology \nwas analyzed with the Mitochondrial Network Analysis plugin for Fiji. \nIndividual counts (<1 branch), network counts (>1 branch), network \nlength and mitochondrial footprint (area covered) were quantified. \nApoE4 induced an increase in mitochondrial footprint (p<0.001) and \nmitochondrial network (p<0.001) indicating an ApoE4-induced in -\ncrease in mitochondrial proliferation.\n404.

The inci -\ndence is higher in boys, and girls present different type and grade of \nsymptoms. As microglia show sex-dependent features and reactive \nmicrogliosis has been reported both in patients and animal models \nof ASD, they are proposed to play a key role in ASD sex-differences. \nThe experimental model of ASD by prenatal exposure to valproic \nacid (VPA) mimics the main behavioral and neuroanatomical alter -\nations found in patients. The aim of this work was to study microglia \nfeatures in male and female VPA rats in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) \nand the hippocampus (HP). Microglia were immunostained for Iba1 \non tissue slices of juvenile control and VPA rats of both sexes. The \nPFC of both male and female VPA rats showed microgliosis charac -\nterized by a higher proportion of iba1 (+) unramified cells. However, \nin the HP, microgliosis was only evident in female VPA rats. To eval -\nuate microglia reactivity and response to different stimuli we per -\nformed microglia primary cultures from control and VPA neonates. ABSTRACTS201\nMicroglia were immunolabeled for Iba1 to study morphology under \nbasal conditions and after exposure either to a pro-inflammatory (li -\npopolysaccharide) or a phagocytic (synaptosomes) stimulus. While \ncortical microglia from male VPA animals showed a pro-inflamma -\ntory profile and an intrinsic resistance to phagocytic stimuli, hippo -\ncampal microglia from male VPA animals matched microglia from \ncontrols under basal condition and showed a preserved response \nto pro-inflammatory and phagocytic stimuli. In the case of microglia \nisolated from females, both cortical and hippocampal microglia from \nVPA rats evidenced morphological changes under basal conditions \nbut both were able to respond to pro-inflammatory and phagocytic \nstimuli. To sum up, microglia from male and female VPA rats show \nsex-dependent changes which may contribute to sex-differences in \nASD.\n405.

Besides, its deregulation is linked with neurodegenerative pathol -\nogies such as Alzheimer Disease and Parkinson Disease. For that \nreason, we generated a deficitary CDK5 genetic model in neurons \nderived from human pluripotent stem cells. For this purpose, we \nused CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate human embryonic and \ninduced pluripotent stem cells (hESCs and hiPSCs, respectively) \nKO-CDK5 lines. CDK5 protein expression levels were analyzed by \nwestern blot in samples obtained from  clones where indels caused \nby CRISPR/Cas9 editing were detected by  DNA sequencing. We \nobtained CDK5-/- clones for H9 hESCs and FN2.1 hiPSCs lines \nand a CDK5+/- clone for H9  hESCs line. Then, neural stem cells \n(NSC) were derived from  the CDK5 KO clones using a commercial \nneural induction medium  and their phenotype was validated by im -\nmunofluorescence staining using antibodies  that recognize specific \nlineage markers (SOX-1, SOX-2, NESTIN and PAX-6).  Finally, NSC \nobtained from the heterozygous CDK5+/- KO H9 hESCs clone were \ndifferentiated into neurons using a 2D-based protocol and  their phe -\nnotype was validated by immunofluorescence staining of neuronal \nspecific markers (TUJ-1 and MAP2). In conclusion, we managed to \nobtain NSC-neurons from CDK5-/- and CDK5+/- clones, determin -\ning that CDK5 is not essential for NSC generation. Besides, neuro -\nnal differentiation was achieved for H9 CDK5+/- clone, indicating \nthat the CDK5 deficiency does  not impair the generation of NSC-de -\nrived neurons. This result allows  us to account with a CDK5-defi -\ncient model to further study  its participation in neuronal homeostasis \ndysfunctions.\n406.

However, it is not clear whether \nthere is a causal link between these factors, which one appears \nearlier in the pathology or if either one of them is triggered by the \nincreasing circulating levels of A\u03b2 or amyloid deposits in early AD. \nOur objective was to study the metabolic and inflammatory status \nof a model of AD, the PDAPP-J20 mouse at the age of 8 months. \nWe also treated a WT group with a high fat diet (HFD) as a positive \ncontrol for IR.  Our hypothesis was that in early stages of AD, the brain develops IR with astrocytes showing reactivity and impaired \ninsulin signaling. Final body weight, glycemia and insulinemia were \nnot affected by genotype or HFD. The open-field test showed an \nanxious-like behavior in transgenic and in HFD-fed mice. Insulin \nsignaling measured by pAkt/Akt ratio was decreased in the hippo -\ncampus of AD mice (p<0.05) but not in the hypothalamus or the \nliver. Pancreatic IL1\u03b2 and COX2 levels were unchanged. Insulin re -\nceptor puncta colocalizing with GFAP+ cells in the hippocampus by \nfluorescent immunolabeling showed a decreasing tendency in trans -\ngenic animals while astrocytic reactivity markers GFAP and S100b \nwere increased (p<0.05). Finally, we evaluated the effect of fibrillar \nA\u03b2 or palmitate on C6 astrocytes in vitro. Astrocytes exposed to A\u03b2 \nshowed increased nuclear translocation of NFkB and decreased \nAKT phosphorylation (p<0.05), suggesting inflammatory activation \nand impaired insulin signaling, respectively. Our results show that \ninflammation and insulin signaling impairment in the hippocampus \nare found in an early stage of experimental AD. The inflammatory \ncontext triggered by increased circulating A\u03b2 or amyloid deposits in \nthe brain could affect astrocytic insulin receptors, hence decreasing \ninsulin signaling and affecting their neuroprotective capacity.\n407.

Dietary \nrestriction is a multitarget strategy that has been linked to several \nbenefits, inducing autophagy flux, decreasing oxidative stress and \ninflammation, and improving metabolism. These effects establish di -\netary restriction as a possible approach to delay physiological aging \nand to prevent or treat aging-related diseases. In a previous work, \nwe evaluated a protocol of periodic dietary restriction (PDR) in an \nanimal model of familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Now, we have stud -\nied the effects of this strategy on aged female mice (16 month-old), \nevaluating metabolic, cognitive, and neuroinflammatory changes.\nPDR involved 5 days of dietary restriction (DR) alternated with 9 \ndays of ad libitum (AL) food intake for 7 weeks. During the DR peri -\nod, mice ate 60% of their habitual intake. \nAnimals under PDR showed similar body weight and glycemia to \nAL mice. During DR periods, circulating ketone bodies increased \n(1WAnova-Sidak, basal vs DR p<0.001) suggesting a fasting-like \neffect. Additionally, we evaluated cognitive performance by the nov -\nel object location recognition test. No changes were observed be -\ntween AL and DR animals, but both groups\u2019 performance was worse \nthan that of 5 month-old mice, evidencing an age-related cognitive \ndecline. We assayed S100b/GFAP by immunofluorescence in the \nhippocampus and analyzed morphological astrocytic parameters. \nS100b, an astrocytic pro-inflammatory marker, was diminished in \nDR mice (vs AL). However, GFAP immunoreactivity was unchanged. \nThese preliminary results evidenced fasting-like effects in mice ex -\nposed to DR. Further, cognitive impairment in aged mice was cor -\nroborated, and a possible modulation of the pro-inflammatory S100b \nwith DR. Future perspectives point to evaluating glial morphology in \ndepth, and autophagy as a possible main mechanism for DR. \n408.

The Wobbler (WR) mouse, a \nrecognized model of ALS, shows a selective loss of motoneurons, \nastrocytosis and microgliosis in cervical spinal cord (CSC). ALS \npresents in men at younger ages than women, but increases after \nmenopause. Testosterone (T) exerts its effects via androgen (AR), \nor estrogen receptors after bioconversion into several metabolites. \nPrevious work has shown that T reduces gliosis and improves clini -\ncal score in male WRs. Now, we investigated the effects of cotreat -\nment of T + anastrazole, an aromatase inhibitor (AI), on: 1) mRNA \nexpression of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and pro -\nteolipid protein (PLP)- 2) CD11B mRNA, a marker of microglia, 3) \n% AR-immunoreactive (IR) cells in ventral horn. T was implanted \nin 10mm silastic tubes for 2 months. AI was given in DMSO 10% \nby Alzet osmotic pumps (1mg/kg/day) s.c. starting 1 week before T. \nFour groups were prepared: a) WRs or (b) controls receiving empty \nsilastic tubes + vehicle-pumps, c) WR+T (silastic tubes filled with T) \n+ vehicle-pumps and d) WR+T+AI. Pituitary weight, a gland sensi -\ntive to estradiol, is greater in WRs (p<0.05 vs. control) and smaller \nin WR+T+AI (p<0.05 vs WR). MOG mRNA rose in WR+T (p<0.05 \nvs WR) but not PLP. However, both myelin genes were significantly \nreduced in WR+T+AI (p <0.01 vs. WR+T). CD11B was reduced by \nT in WRs (p<0.05 vs. WR), but WRs and WR+T+AI showed higher \nexpression (p<0.05 vs. controls or WR+T). The % AR-IR cells were \nlow in WRs and WRs+T+AI (p<0.01 vs. controls), but increased \nin WR+T (p<0.01 vs WR). The mRNA for the steroidogenic acute \nregulatory protein (StAR) increased in WRs (p<0.05 vs control) and \nwas still higher in WR+T and WR+T+AI (p <0.05; p <0.01 vs WRs). \nThese data support that estrogen-derived aromatase may play a \nrole in androgen neuroprotection. \n409.

In addition, long-term mea -\nsurements have not been performed. Therefore, the aim of the \npresent work was to investigate the effects of noise exposure \nin the hippocampus (HC) of adolescent female and male rats \non biochemical parameters evaluated at short and long-term.  \nMale and females PND28 Wistar rats were separated into different \ncages and at PND 33 a subgroup was exposed to noise (2h, 95-\n97 dB). HC was dissected at short (PND 33) and long-term (PND \n39) to assess reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and catalase \nactivity (CAT). Results showed an increase in ROS levels in fe -\nmales (sham: 0.004\u00b10.001; noise: 0.123\u00b10.005) and males (sham: \n0.019\u00b10.004; noise: 0.054\u00b10.003) and an increase in CAT activity \nonly in males (sham: 0.0004\u00b10,0002 noise: 0.001\u00b10.0001) when \nevaluated at short term. In contrast, long-term results showed a \ndecrease in CAT activity in females (sham: 0.001\u00b10.0004; noise: \n0.0003\u00b10.0007), whereas no significant differences were found in \nmales. No differences were found in either group in ROS levels.  \nThese results suggest that noise exposure may induce short-term \nchanges in oxidative markers that seem to disappear at long-term \nand to be sex-specific. In conclusion, adolescence seems to be a \nperiod of vulnerability to different stimuli capable of generating oxi -\ndative imbalance in the hippocampus, which could underlie some of \nthe behavioral changes previously observed.\n410.

Different factors have been associated with \nincreased alcohol consumption (AC), such as personality, alcohol \nexpectancies and  social isolation (e.g. COVID-19 lockdown). Thus, \nthe aim of this work was to evaluate the AC pattern and the potential \ninfluence of personality, alcohol  expectancies and lockdown in stu -\ndents from the University of Buenos Aires.\nA sample of 1776  US completed an online survey that assessed \nthe amount and frequency of  AC before and during the first year of \nCOVID-19 pandemic. In addition, US responded to the BIG-5 and \nCEA-A questionnaires to assess personality  traits and alcohol ex -\npectancies.\nResults showed that students\u2019 AC was highly prevalent both before \nand during the lockdown. In addition, men consumed significantly \nmore alcohol than women per occasion (F1,3523=12.83) and month \n(F1,3523=21.10), but women had more episodes of heavy drinking \n(\u03c72=40.68). When comparing both time periods, the amount and \nfrequency of AC decreased during lockdown (F3,3523= 36,67 and \nF3,3523=  14,15). Moreover, positive and significant correlations \nwere observed between AC and personality traits  such as agree -\nableness (rs= 0.08 to 0.11) and responsibility (rs=\n0.06 to 0.13) in women, and extraversion (rs= 0.13) and agreeable -\nness (rs= 0.16 to 0.21) in men. Finally, results showed positive and \nsignificant correlations  between AC and all alcohol expectancies \nevaluated (positive and negative), in both sexes  (rs= 0.11 to 0.37).\nIn conclusion, this study suggests that AC is highly prevalent in US, \nwhich is worrying given the negative consequences associated with  \nit. Furthermore, factors such as personality and alcohol expectan -\ncies could promote AC, whereas lockdown decreased it. Finally, the \nknowledge about risk and protective factors for AC is important for \nthe development of interventions aimed at preventing and reducing \nAC.\n411.

Folate  depletion with hyperhomocystein -\nemia are related with immune activation; however, the  association \nbetween folate (vitamin B9) and the immune system in  PD requires \nfurther research. Aim: To evaluate the effect of  folate-producing and \nimmunomodulatory lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in PD models.  Meth -\nods: Streptococcus thermophilus (St.) CRL808 (folate producer ABSTRACTS203\nstrain), and  St. CRL807 (immunomodulatory strain) were evaluated \nindividually using in vitro  and in vivo PD models. N2a neuronal cells \nwere differentiated  to dopaminergic neurons with di-butyryl cyclic \nAMP and then exposed to the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridin -\nium (MPP+) in presence of intracellular extracts from LAB or the \ncommercial vitamin B9. Cell viability, IL-6 production and reactive \noxygen species (ROS) were determined. In vivo , LAB were  admin -\nistered to mice injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro -\npyridine (MPTP). Motor capacity, tyrosine  hydroxylase (TH) in brain, \nand cytokines in serum were evaluated.  Results: Neurotoxic effect \nof MPP+ decreased in cells cultured with  both LAB intracellular ex -\ntracts. This result was related with significant  (p<0.05) decrease of \nROS formation and IL-6 release by the  neurons. Mice given LAB \nimproved motor skills altered by MPTP and significantly (p<0.05) \nincreased the number of TH+ neurons in the brain. The LAB effect \nwas associated to decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines such  as \nIL-6 and TNF-alpha and increased levels of IL-10 in  the serum of \nthe mice. Conclusions: LAB selected as folate producers and as \nimmunomodulators have the potential to be used as  adjuvants in \nPD, improving both vitamin deficiency and the inflammatory  state \nassociated with this pathology, which translates into less loss  of do -\npaminergic neurons and better motor skills.\n412. (290) GLUN2A REDUCED EXPRESSION CHANGES MO -\nLECULAR COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF SYN -\nAPSES WHICH WOULD BE RELATED TO CERTAIN \nTYPES OF EPILEPSIES\nMar\u00eda Ver\u00f3nica Baez 1,2\n1.

UBA.\nFor several years, NMDA receptors (NMDAR) have been involved \nin memory  and learning processes as well as in a wide range  of \nneurodevelopmental disorders, as epilepsies. NMDAR are hetero -\ntetramers composed by  two GluN1 obligatory subunits and two reg -\nulatory subunits, being GluN2A  and GluN2B the most expressed in \nhippocampus and other cognitive related  structures. During devel -\nopment and synaptic maturation, there is a shift  in GluN2A/GluN2B \nexpression ratio. This change was called the developmental  switch \nand modifications in this relationship were associated to learning  \nand memory as well as to different pathologies. Recently, grin2a  (the \ngene that codifies for GluN2A) mutations were related to  complex \nsyndromes that include the development of seizures and or  epilep -\nsy. In this work, we induced a knockdown in GluN2A  expression \n(GluN2A-KD) after developmental switch in vitro and in vivo . Results \nshowed that NMDAR total amount and GluN2A/GluN2B ratio was  \ndecreased in GLuN2A- KD cultures. Moreover, downregulation of \nGluN2A in vitro increased dendritic branching and the number of \ndendritic spines,  which in consequence, rise neuronal excitability. \nOn the other hand,  in vivo, GluN2A silenced expression in hippo -\ncampus, induced an impairment  in contextual fear conditioning \nmemory and a change in spatial-exploration.  In addition, rats where \nGluN2A hippocampal expression were silenced, showed  increased \nseizure susceptibility, both in time and intensity. Altogether, these  \nresults led us to conclude that the decrease in GluN2A expression \nwould be related to epileptogenic mechanisms.\n413.

Med.-UBA; \nParaguay 2155, CABA. *Equal contributions. \nIn previous reports we found that  chronic mild stress (CMS) expo -\nsure induces a decrease in learning  and memory in female BALB/c \nmice. This cognitive deficit correlated  with a decrease in CD4+C -\nD25+FOXP3+ and an increase  in CD4+CD25-FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in CMS mice spleen. No differences in the CD4+C -\nD25+FOXP3+ and  CD4+CD25-FOXP3+ Tregs were found in lymph \nnodes in stressed mice. Tregs have an important role in maintaining \nself-tolerance through the inhibition of effector T cells. The main \ncytokines involved in this mechanism are IL- 10 and TGF-\u03b2, both \nreleased by Treg cells. Moreover, glatiramer acetate (GA) (synthetic \namino acid polymer that can safely simulate the protective and re -\nparative effects of autoreactive T cells) reverted the behavior and the \nneuroimmune alterations induced by CMS. In this context, the aim of \nthis work was to evaluate the GA effect on the Treg cells in spleen \nand ARNm levels of TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 in hippocampus of CMS mice. \nHere, we show that CMS mice presented a poor learning perfor -\nmance in Y-maze and open field test. The Treg were evaluated by \nflow cytometry. The decrease of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ (control-PBS \nvs. CMS-PBS:  p<0.05) and the increase of CD4+CD25-FoxP3+ \n(control-PBS vs. CMS-PBS: p<0.01) cells in spleen of CMS mice \nwere reverted by GA treatment (CMS-PBS vs. CMS-GA: p<0.05 \nand CD4+CD25-FoxP3+= CMS-PBS vs. CMS-GA: p<0.01, respec -\ntively). The mRNA expression by qRT-PCR indicated an increase in \nthe mRNA levels of TGF-\u03b2 in hippocampus in CMS mice respect to \ncontrol mice (p<0.05). This levels were reverted by GA in CMS mice \n(p<0.05). No differences in the mRNA levels of IL-10 were found in \nhippocampus of stressed mice. Our findings indicate that GA revert \nthe chronic stress effects on the immune system through a mecha -\nnism that involves Treg cells possibly by the release of TGF-\u03b2. This \nsuggests Treg cells participation in the cognitive deficit observed in \nchronic stressed female mice and this can be reverted  by GA.\n414.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is specially vulnerable to oxi -\ndative damage and Base Excision Repair (BER) is the main mtDNA \nrepair mechanism. Ovarian hormone loss during natural or induced \nreproductive senescence is associated with mitochondrial alter -\nations, synaptic decline and increased risk of age-related diseases.\nThe aim of this work was to assess whether hormone-replacement \ntreatments affect the expression of BER enzymes to explain pre -\nvious results regarding the differential activity of such enzymes in \nthe hippocampus (Hp) and cerebral cortex (Cc) of hormone-treated \novariectomized (OVX) rats. \nTo this aim, adult OVX or sham-operated (SHAM) rats were s.c. with \nempty or containing estradiol (E) and/or progesterone (P) silastic \ncapsules. After 12 weeks, cDNA was obtained from total RNA ex -\ntracted from the Hp and Cc and amplified by qPCR using specific \nprimers for BER enzymes.\nThe expression of DNA glycosylases was either lower o similar to \nSHAM group in both Hp and Cc of OVX rats (NEIL1 p<0,01; NEIL2 \np<0,05; UNG1 p<0,01; OGG1 ns; Student\u00b4s t test). Similar results \nwere obtained for the rest of the enzymes of the pathway (AP en -\ndonuclease1, \u03b3-polymerase and lygase3 p<0,05, Student\u00b4s t test). \nHormone treatments did not affect the expression of OGG1, NEIL2 \nor UNG1 in any brain region, but increased the expression of NEIL1 \nonly in the Hp (E+P p<0,05; ANOVA). On the other hand, P alone \nor combined with E, increased the expression of the rest of the en -\nzymes of the pathway in both brain regions (p<0,05; ANOVA).\nOur results show that OVX decreases the expression of BER en -MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021204\nzymes in both brain regions and that there is no association between \nARNm levels and the activity of such enzymes in hormone-treated \nrats. Thus, hormones exert their regional differential action on BER \npathway through a mechanism not involving gene regulation.\n415.

AD hallmarks include aberrant Amyloid-\u03b2 and \nTau accumulation in the brain, the presence of chronic neuroinflam -\nmation and alterations in brain metabolism. Evidence suggest a \npossible shared pathophysiology between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n(T2D) and AD, as impaired insulin signaling. Some therapeutic strat -\negies employed on T2D subjects could be beneficial on AD patients. \nHere, we evaluated the effect of the antidiabetic drug metformin on \npatients enrolled in ADNI, an observational and longitudinal study \nincluding patients from all around the world. We employed data from \npatients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD \nand we performed a principal component analysis focusing on bio -\nmarkers associated to AD measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). \nWe concluded that MCI metformin-treated patients were globally \ncharacterized as subjects with a better CSF biomarkers profile than \nthe mean population of MCI patients (p<0.05). On the other hand, \ncontrol subjects and T2D patients were paired by age, gender, ApoE \nallele and years of education, defining three groups: MCI, MCI+T2D \nand MCI+T2D+metformin. We evaluated the effect of T2D and met -\nformin treatment employing the PACC score, and composites de -\nfined from standardized ADNI variables to evaluate the memory and \nlearning function. We found that MCI+T2D patients have a worse \ncognitive performance than MCI patients (p<0.01), but this deleteri -\nous effect was not observed in MCI+T2D+metformin patients. These \ncognitive variations were associated with changes in cortical thick -\nness and hippocampal volume obtained from Magnetic Resonance \nImages (p<0.001). To summary, our study shows a beneficial effect \nof metformin treatment on cognitive performance, CSF biomarkers \nprofile and neuroanatomical measures in MCI due to AD patients.\n416. (419) PLASMA BIOMARKERS FOR THE EARLY DETEC -\nTION OF ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE USING A MACHINE \nLEARNING BASED LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL\nJessica L Presa*, Gustavo E Juantorena*, Laouen Belloli*.\n*authors with equal contribution.\nAlzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. \nClinical and basic research hope for early interventions to cure or \nstop the progression of the disease. However, patients seeking help \nmostly present mild to advanced cognitive decline. While it would be \nhelpful to look for early signs of AD, specific tests are not routine -\nly done and present elevated costs. Notably, evidence shows that \nblood biomarkers are altered through the progression of the disease.\nHere, we used patients\u2019 plasma biomarkers data available from Alz-\nheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) from healthy con -\ntrols (HC), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD to develop an automated classifier. The total of patients selected was \n544 (55 HC, 379 MCI, 110 AD) all having associated demographic \nand cognitive information. We used a total of 146 routine blood tests \nresults, such as transferrin and CRP, and d id not include AB, Tau \nof=r pT au.\nThere was no difference in representativity of females, age, educa -\ntion level or ethnia between groups. We separated the data into a \ntrain set and a hold-out set. We performed cross validation with the \ntrain sets with 5 folds and a grid search for hyper parameters optimi -\nzation to train a logistic regression model. Employing the train set, \nour model presented a  ROC curve with an AUC for HC prediction \nof 0.86, MCI\n0.81 and  AD 0.79. When tested with the hold-out, the AUC of the \nROC curves were HC: 0.81, MCI: 0.77 and AD: 0.77. Only 2%  of \nMCI patients were misclassified as HC, and none AD patient was \nclassified in the HC group. Feature importance analysis showed \npregnancy associated plasma protein as the most relevant param -\neter, in accordance with literature. While the number of patients be -\ntween groups is unbalanced, our classifier has a very good predic -\ntive power and successfully minimizes type 2 errors. In the future, it \nwould be important to increase the number of subjects to train and \ntest the model with balanced groups.\n417.

This membrane \nacts as an insulator increasing the speed of stimulus transmission. \nMyelination is a continuous process that begins when axons reach \na diameter of approximately 1 \u00b5m and follows a structural sequence \nwith a caudo-rostral, dorso-ventral and center-to-periphery progres -\nsion which varies between species. The aim of this study was to \nanalyze the myelination process during the embryogenesis of the \nSouth America plains vizcacha, Lagostomus maximus , an hystrico -\nmorph rodent native from Argentina, and to compare it with this pro -\ncess in rat, mouse and guinea pig. Brains of 24 embryos, distributed \nbetween 51 embryonic days (e.d.) and 2 days postnatal, were used \nand studied by Kl\u00fcver-Barrera histological technique. The onset of \nthe myelination process was observed around mid-pregnancy. In -\nside the brain, the myelination process began around 72 e.d. up to \n118 e.d. in the cortex; at the same time, the myelination extended \ntowards connection fibers beginning in the external cingulate at 106 \ne.d. and gradually progressing towards the internal cingulate from \n112 e.d. onwards. At 124 e.d., the internal and external capsule, \nand optic chiasm were myelinated. After that, striosomes of the cor -\npus striatum and the fornix columns were myelinated at 133 e.d. At \nbirth time (155 e.d.), all the intra-hemispheric white matter structures \nwere myelinated, but the inter-hemispheric connections of the cor -\npus callosum and the anterior commissure were not myelinated yet. \nThese results show that both the onset of the myelination process \nand its progression during embryonic development are framed in \nthe precocial character of L. maximus. The onset of this process \nin vizcacha agreed with that in guinea pig, and was in contrast to \nthe postnatal onset in rat and mouse. Grant: Fundaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica \nFelipe Fiorellino.\n418.

Hospital Neuropsiqui\u00e1trico Braulio A. Moyano\nMood Disorder (MD) affects more than 300 million people globally, \nand its etiology is unknown. In recently published data, MD has been \ncorrelated with the inflammation and the immune system. This study \naims to determine if there is a specific activation profile of mono -\ncyte-macrophage in patients with an MD that differentiates them \nfrom healthy control (HC), and to analyze if this activation profile in \npatients with MD is present only during a clinical episode of active \ndepression (AD) or during no clinically active depression (NAD).\nPatients and HC were recruited and evaluated by psychiatrists us -\ning the International Psychiatry Interview MINI to diagnose the MD \nand the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HADRS) to define the 3 \ngroups: AD, NAD, or HC. Blood samples were obtained and directly \nstained in 100 uL with the following cocktail of antibodies CD11b, \nHLA-DR, CD86, CD14, and CD16. IRB approved the study; each \nparticipant gave written consent. MD sample was 23% male, 77% \nfemale with a 25-62-year age range. \nCirculating monocytes and the proportion of the three subtypes were \nanalyzed by flow cytometry based on CD16negCD14++ (classical), \nCD16+CD14+ (intermediate) and CD16++CD14neg (non-classical). \nAdditionally, the level of 16 cytokines was measured in plasma em -\nploying two panels of Legend Plex system by flow cytometry. Each \npanel was evaluated in a single sample of 50 uL of plasma. Our \npreliminary analysis shows that patients with MD (n=26) have a sig -\nnificantly reduced proportion of classical monocytes (p=0.02) and \nincreased intermediate (p=0.02), and an upward trend in non-classi -\ncal subsets (p=0.07) compared to the HC group (n=7). Moreover, we \nobserved that patients with MD have higher concentrations of IL-1 b \n(p=0.002), IFN g (p=0.019) and IL-17 (p=0.004) than HC samples. \nAfter segregation of patients in AD (N=17) vs. NAD (N=12), no sig -\nnificant differences were observed yet, showing that some patients \nwith MD have an inflammatory compromise even in remission.\n419.

Ex -\nternal and internal factors guide GnRH neurons migration during \nembryonic development from the olfactory bulb up to the hypo -\nthalamus, specifically at preoptic area (POA) and arcuate nucleus \n(ARC). In the adult South American plains vizcachas, Lagostomus \nmaximus  (Rodentia, Hystricomorpha), GnRH neurons are located in \nPOA, ARC, suprachiasmatic (SCN), and supraoptic (SON) nuclei. \nThis work aimed to characterize the migration of GnRH neurons \nup to their colonization of the hypothalamus in the vizcacha during \nthe embryonic development. Thirty-six vizcachas from 52-embryon -\nic days (ed) up to birth (~155-ed) were used. Complete heads or \nbrains were removed and used for histological and immunohisto -\nchemical localization of GnRH neurons. GnRH cells without dendrit -\nic processes appeared firstly as early as 52-ed outside the CNS, in \nthe olfactory epithelium, with increased number at 60-ed. At 75-ed, \nGnRH cells were found in the olfactory bulb tract within the brain, \nand at 80-ed, they began to colonize the hypothalamus at the POA, \nfollowing a ventro-dorsal migration route from the piriformis area, going through the SCN. Then, at 112-ed, was observed a decrease \nin the number of GnRH neurons in the POA together with an in -\ncrease in the amount of GnRH varicosities. Comparison of GnRH \ncell migration between vizcacha and other rodents, identifies differ -\nences in the migration stages between vizcacha and mouse. The \nmigration of GnRH neurons in vizcacha from the olfactory epithelium \nsupports the extra-CNS origin in Rodentia. This is the first study of \nCentral neurogenesis in Hystricomorpha, with GnRH cells as the \nmain elements. The signaling molecules that participate in the ven -\ntro-dorsal migration to the hypothalamus remain to be described in \nfurther investigations.\n420.

We \nhave previously shown that TBI increases levels of protein (AOPP) \nand lipid (MDA) peroxidation, considered oxidative stress (OS) bio -\nmarkers that persisted over a week. Regardless the research invest -\nment on the development of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective \ntreatments, most pre-clinical studies did not report significant effects, \nprobably because of the limited blood brain barrier permeability of \nclinically available anti-inflammatory drug formulations. Objective:  \nto evaluate the effectiveness of brain selective nanocarriers, loaded \nwith the synthetic glucocorticoid triamcinolone (NA-TA), to prevent \noxidative stress (OS) processes and to reduce the emotional se -\nquelae induced by TBI. Materials and methods : TBI was induced \nin anesthetized adult male Wistar rats, which 15 min and 24 h later \nreceived a dose of NA-TA. Animals were sacrificed 1 or 7 days after \ntreatment to measure AOPP and MDA levels in different brain areas. \nOther groups of animals were exposed to contextual fear condition -\ning 6 days after TBI and treatment.  Twenty-four h (test 1) and 6 days \n(test 2, 12 days after TBI) after conditioning, fear memory expression \nwas evaluated. Results : TBI induced a significant decrease in the % \nfreezing only in test 2 compared to the controls (two-way ANOVA). \nInterestingly, preliminary data suggest that animals treated with NA-\nTA did not show changes in fear memory.  Also, TA prevented incre -\nments in AOPP and MDA levels (one-way ANOVA).  Conclusions:  \nTBI induced neuroinflammatory mediators that could have detrimen -\ntal actions on fear memory retention, probably through emotional \nprocessing alteration. NA-TA administration could be a therapeutic \nalternative for the early treatment of neuroinflammation mediated by \nTBI, that contribute to the emotional sequelae prevention.\n421.

Moyano\nMood Disorders (MD) are highly prevalent psychiatric conditions \noccurring early in life and follow a relapsing and remitting course. \nDuring the last years, emerging literature associated MD with in -\ncreased inflammatory status and unbalanced immune response. \nThis was particularly evident in patients with no response to the \nconventional treatment, giving rise to the inflammatory theory of \ndepression. This study aimed to determine the activation status of \ncirculating CD4 lymphocytes in patients with MD coursing a clinical \nepisode of active depression (AD) or during no clinically active de -\npression (NAD).\nPatients with MD were evaluated by psychiatrists using the Interna -\ntional Psychiatry Interview MINI to diagnose the MD and the Hamil -\nton Depression Rating Scale (HADRS) to define AD (N=8) and NAD \n(N=18) status. MD sample was 26% male and 74% female with a \n25-62 year age range. \nBlood samples were obtained and directly stained using the follow -\ning antibodies against human (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD69, CD44, PD1, \nLAG3 and viability dye) and analyzed by flow cytometry. \nThis preliminary and partial analysis of the current study shows that \npatients with active MD have increased levels of CD69 activation \nmarker on circulating CD4 T cells compared with patients with NAD \n(p<0.01). No significant difference was observed on the other acti -\nvation marker, CD44. When we analyzed the exhaustion markers, \nPD1 and LAG3, we found a significant increase of LAG3 on circu -\nlating CD4 lymphocytes of patients with AD vs. NAD (p<0.05). Fur -\nthermore, most of the circulating CD4 T cells from patients with MD \nshowed increased levels of activation markers compared with CD4 \nT cells from the mononuclear fraction of healthy volunteers.\nThese results clearly show that the lymphocyte compartment of \npatients with MD presents an unbalanced active condition, more \nskewed in patients with AD. It is also interesting that some patients \nwith MD show an inflammatory compromise even in remission of \nclinical symptomatology.\n422. (497) POSITIVE EFFECTS OF ORCHIECTOMY ON SWIM -\nMING BEHAVIOR IN HEMIPARKINSONIAN ANIMALS \nTREATED WITH THE NEUROACTIVE STEROIDS ESTRO -\nGEN AND PROGESTERONE \nNatalia Gonz\u00e1lez1, Ricardo Cabrera1 \n1Instituto de investigaciones biom\u00e9dicas. (INBIOMED)\u2013Uni -\nversidad de Mendoza-IMBECU-CONICET.\nParkinson\u2019s disease is the second most frequent neurodegenerative \npathology after Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with a predominance in men \nover women. Unilateral neurotoxic injury with 6-hydroxydopamine \n(6-OHDA) induces selective dopaminergic neurodegeneration and \nhemiparkinsonism in rats with contralateral predominant motor im -\npairment. The aim was to evaluate whether the decrease in tes -\ntosterone concentration by orchiectomy (ORX) would be a positive \nfactor on the neuroprotective effect induced by estrogen (E) and pro -\ngestrone (P) administration on the motor and depressive-like behav -\nior alterations observed in the injured animals. Male Sprague-Daw -\nley rats (280-320 g) aged 60 days ORX and non-ORX were used. \nAt 10 days post ORX, neurodegeneration was induced by microin -\njection of 6-OHDA into the left striatum. The experimental groups \nwere 1- non-ORX: control (C), E and P-treated control (CEP), hemi -\nparkinsonian (HP), E and P-treated hemiparkinsonian (HPEP) and \n2-ORX: control (CO), E and P-treated control (COEP), hemiparkin -\nsonian (HPO), E and P-treated hemiparkinsonian (HPOEP). Signs \nof motor impairment and hopelessness, were assessed by a forced \nswim test (PNF). Data were expressed as mean+SEM and analyzed \nby ANOVA 2 and Student Newman-Keuls.\nORX induced a significant increase in swimming time in HP ani -\nmals with respect to group C (p<0.0001). This significant increase \nwas increased in the HPOEP group with respect to the COEP group \n(p<0.05). Likewise, the magnitude of the increase was greater in \nHPOEP animals with respect to HPO animals (p<0.0001). We con -\nclude that the decrease of testosterone by ORX is a positive induc -\ning factor on the alterations in the motor and hopelessness signs, at \nthe same time that the administration of E+P potentiates the positive response on the evaluated variables, proposing this combination of \nneuroendocrine modifications as a potential neuroprotective and \nneuroregenerating inducing treatment on neurodegenerative noxas. \n423. (500) OXIDATIVE STRESS IN HUNTINGTON DISEASE \nMODELS: BDNF ANTIOXIDANT EFFECT\nFederico L\u00f3pez Couselo, Julieta Saba, Julieta Bruno, Lila \nCarniglia, Daniela Durand, Mercedes Lasaga, Carla Caruso.\nInstituto de Investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas (INBIOMED) \nUBA-CONICET, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Bue -\nnos Aires.\nHuntington disease (HD) involves oxidative stress and mitochondrial \ndysfunction which can be mimicked by 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP), a \nphenotypic model of HD. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generate \noxidative stress which is associated with neuronal death. Glutathio -\nne (GSH) is an antioxidant molecule secreted by astrocytes that can \nprotect neurons from death by reducing ROS levels. Superoxide \ndismutase 2 (SOD2) is a mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme that re -\nduces ROS levels and its overexpression provides neuroprotection. \nWe have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) redu -\nces ROS levels induced by 3NP in astrocytes and increases intra -\ncellular GSH while 3NP reduces extracellular GSH levels. Now, we \nhave studied BDNF effect on ROS production in cortical astrocytes, \nand GSH levels and SOD2 expression in cortical and striatal astro -\ncytes. We found that BDNF reduces ROS levels induced by 3NP in \ncortical astrocytes (p<0.05 DCFH-DA assay). Intracellular GSH le -\nvels were increased by BDNF in both astrocyte populations (p<0.05 \nNDA assay). 3NP reduced extracellular GSH levels regardless of \nthe presence of BDNF (p<0.05 cortical, p<0.01 striatal astrocytes). \nSOD2 expression, although not modified by BDNF, was increased \nby 3NP in striatal astrocytes (p<0.05). We also evaluated motor \nperformance, ROS and GSH levels in Q175 (HD mice), a knock-in \nmodel of HD which has not been tested for oxidative stress. We ob -\nserved reduced motor performance in the open field test in 4-mon -\nth-old (p<0.05) and 8-month-old (p<0.0001) HD mice compared to \nWT mice. 4-month-old HD mice cortex presented higher ROS levels \n(p<0.05) and 8-month-old HD mice striatum showed lower GSH le -\nvels (p<0.05) than WT mice. In brief, BDNF antioxidant effect could \nbe a protective mechanism for neurodegeneration by reducing ROS \nlevels and increasing intracellular GSH. Q175 mice model of HD \nexhibits signs of oxidative stress as early as 4 months.\n424.

Chronic inflammation and insulin resistance \ncomprise the most relevant shared pathways, promoting alterations \nin the plasticity of limbic structures such as the hippocampus. With \nthe aim to study the impact of metabolic disturbances on the brain \nwe focused on the role of glial cells in two different approaches: in \nvivo, in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice exposed to a  high fat diet \n(HFD) and in vitro , emulating the lipotoxic context with the saturated \nfatty acid palmitate (PA) as an insult to microglia and astrocyte cell \nlines and the role of ceramide pathway.\nWe have previously found that HFD mice exhibited decreased neu -\nrogenesis and structural synaptic alterations, together with spatial \nmemory impairment and neuroinflammation, with increased ex -\npression of hippocampal TNF\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2 cytokines and enlarged \nmicroglia. Here, we show that astrocytes also respond to the inflam -\nmatory status with a trend to increased S100b staining and a high -\ner cell complexity (assessed by GFAP labeling and Sholl analysis \nRM-ANOVA p<0.05). Microglial cells exposed to PA showed induced ABSTRACTS207\nphagocytic ability and the expression of IL1\u03b2, but this effect was pre -\nvented if ceramide synthesis was inhibited  by Cambinol (p<0.05).\nRegarding the interaction between glial cells, while PA  failed to in -\nduce IL1\u03b2 expression in astrocytes, conditioned media (CM)  from \nPA-exposed microglia did (p<0.001) and this effect was absent  \nwhen microglia was pretreated with Cambinol. Interestingly, prelimi -\nnary data showed  that exosomes derived from PA-microglia exerted \nthe same effect as  the complete PA-derived CM, suggesting a rel -\nevant function .\nOur results suggest a role of ceramide pathway in the induction and \npropagation of the inflammatory context induced by PA in glial cells.\n425.

The recent \nchemical characterization of Oe revealed the presence of an antidia -\nbetogenic compound. We have previously reported that Oe produc -\nes beneficial properties on rats with experimental induced diabetes. \nThe sustained sucrose consumption during the early developmental \nstage may cause insulin resistance. Also, we have recently reported \nthat this consumption increases the anxious type behavior in adult -\nhood. Here we studied the preventive effects of Oe on insulin resis -\ntance development and anxiety of rats subjected to sucrose con -\nsumption during the juvenile stage (childhood-adolescence). Male \nrats (SD) received as drinking solution sucrose (10% W/V; group \nSUC) or sucrose + Oe decoction (5% W/V; group SUC+Oe) from \nPND 21 to PND 61. A glucose tolerance test was performed on PND \n62 and the values of the area under curve (AUC) were obtained. \nAn open field test was realized on PND 63 and the recorded ses -\nsions were analyzed using the ANY-maze\u00a9 software. This program \ndetermines the entrance number (EN), the distance traveled (DT) \nand the permanence time (PT) in three zones of the device (central: \nzone 1; intermediate: zone 2; peripheric: zone 3). The AUC levels \nof SUC+Oe were 25% lower than those of SUC (p<0.001). The EN \nand PT the zones 1 and 2 from SUC+Oe animals were higher than \nthose of SUC (p<0.05). Also, the PT in zone 3 of SUC+Oe was lower \nthan that of SUC (p<0.05). These results revealed that rats drinking \nSUC+Oe had lower levels of anxiety than those drinking only SUC. \nThus, the Oe administration may prevent the development of insu -\nlin resistance and reduces the anxious behavior. Additional studies \nare required to propose Oe as a new source of therapeutic phyto -\ncompounds and to extrapolate these effects to humans. (PIP-0243,  \nPICT2019-623).\n426.

However, its clinical use in long-term \nchronic pain treatment is limited by the enormous addictive potential. \nThe co-administration of morphine with other drugs that enhance the \nanalgesic effect and reduce its reinforcing properties, could be an \nalternative in pain treatment with opioids.\nIn the present study, we propose to determine the lower effective \ndose of morphine to ameliorate the nociceptive threshold by using \nthe partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) in male and female Balb/C mice, a widely used model of neuropathic pain. The Von Frey test \n(VFT) was performed in order to evaluate mechanical allodynia by \ncalculating the nociceptive threshold (g). First, mice were habitu -\nated to the environment of the experiment during 4 days. After the \nhabituation period, baseline responses were measured and surgery \nof the right paw was performed in a group of animals with PSNL \n(PSNL group), and surgery without PSNL was executed in another \ngroup (Sham group). On day 9 after surgery, VFT was performed \nafter administration of morphine (1, 3, 9 mg / kg, i.p.) or saline solu -\ntion as vehicle.\nFinally, three-factor ANOVA (sex, surgery, treatment) was applied \nwith Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test, using a p <0.05 as statistically significant.\nOur results showed that morphine (1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg) was able \nto reduce neuropathic pain in male and female mice, respectively \n(p < 0.05). The sexual dimorphism observed herein, confirms the \nlower sensitivity of females compared to males in the antinociceptive \nresponse of morphine.\nThe lower effective doses of morphine determined in male and fe -\nmale mice by a neuropathic pain model, will allow us to continue \nwith our research in order to evaluate potential therapeutic targets \nto enhance the analgesic effect of opiates, reducing or preventing \nthe addictive properties.\n427.

IBYME-CO -\nNICET\nManganese (Mn) intake is essential at physiological concentrations. \nHowever, prolonged exposure produces a neurodegenerative dis -\nease called manganism, whose symptoms are often confused with \nidiopathic Parkinson\u00b4s disease. Even though the harmful effect of \nMn in different cell types has been described, much remains to be \nunderstood regarding the outcomes of glial activation on neuronal \ndeath. Objective: To evaluate the effect of soluble mediators re -\nleased by microglial cells after Mn exposure on neuronal integrity. \nFor this purpose, we first characterized the direct effect of Mn expo -\nsure on neuronal and microglial cells, and then explored the influ -\nence of microglia-conditioned medium (MCM) on neurons viability. \nMethodology: MCMs were generated by BV-2 cells incubation with \n250-1000 \u00b5M Mn for periods of 3 or 6 h, and were used to stimulate \nN27 neuronal cells for 24h; cell viability was assessed using MTT \nreduction assay; the study of ROS production was performed using \nDCFDA; the change in mRNA expression was quantified by RT-qP -\nCR. Results: In N27 neuronal cells, Mn exposure induced a concen -\ntration-dependent decrease in cell viability after 24h (100-1000 \u00b5M, \nP<0.05), which was associated with an increase in ROS production. \nOn the other hand, BV-2 cells increased ROS production after 3 and \n6 h of Mn exposure, with no change in their viability (P<0.05). MCM \nof cells exposed to Mn induced a decrease in N27 viability (P<0.01), \nconsistent with an increase in ROS production and a change in N27 \nmorphology. Finally, we observed a higher expression of IL-1\u03b2 and \nTNF-\u03b1 mRNA in Mn exposed BV-2 cells (6 and 4 fold-increase, re -\nspectively, P<0.001, 750 \u00b5M). Conclusion: In microglial cells, Mn \nexposure induces cytokines expression and ROS generation, prob -\nably responsible for decreasing neuronal viability. The advance in \nthe knowledge of Mn toxicity mechanisms will facilitate its diagnosis \nand the design of effective therapeutic strategies to avoid neurode -\ngeneration.\n428.

IQUI -\nBICEN- CONICET.  \nSanfilippo syndrome type IIIA (Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA; MPSII -\nIA) is a rare intractable disease characterized by an early-onset, se -\nvere, progressive neurodegeneration. It is caused by mutations in \nthe gene encoding for the lysosomal hydrolase N-Sulfoglucosamine \nSulfohydrolase (SGSH), which is crucial in the stepwise degrada -\ntion of the sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) heparan sulfate (HS). \nNowadays, there is a lack of cellular models to explore the mecha -\nnisms of disease in the central nervous system (CNS). In this work, \nwe aimed to develop a novel neuronal model by employing CRISPR/\nCas9 technology. We designed two sgRNAs targeting exon 1 of the \nmouse sgsh  gene and cloned these sequences in the pX330 vector. \nInsert-containing plasmids were amplified and checked by PCR and \nsequencing. HT-22 hippocampal neurons were transfected with PEI, \nand transfected cells were selected with puromycin. Subsequently, \nclones were isolated and amplified. We determined the lack of en -\nzyme activity by employing the fluorogenic substrate 4-MU-GlcNS \nand obtained five putative knock-out cell lines where we tested ly -\nsosomal and mitochondrial integrity. Once confirmed the successful \nknockout by sequencing, these cell lines will constitute reliable re -\nporters of the cellular context of disease and great models to study \ncell-type-specific damage. The strategy used is versatile and will be \nemployed in other cell lineages to study cell-cell interactions of dif -\nferent cell types within the CNS. Further research may lead to the \nidentification of relevant signaling pathways to investigate candidate \ndrugs for novel therapies. \n429.

We recently demon -\nstrated that these cells in the rd1 retinal degeneration mouse have \ndecreased regenerative potential, an excessive number of neurons \ninteracting with MGC, and a notable reduction in their lamellipodia, \nrespective to their wild type ( wt) counterparts. This suggests that ex -\ntracellular matrix (ECM) protein synthesis and/or secretion could be \naltered in rd1, interfering with the substrate adhesion and lamellipo -\ndia extension, and thus   affecting rd1 MGC morphology and function -\nality. The aim of this work was to study rd1 ECM protein expression \nand localization, and determine whether ECM pretreatment could \nrestore the rd1 MGC morphology and functionality. Using mixed \nneuron-glial cultures obtained from postnatal day two rd1 and wt \nmice retinas, we analyzed by immunocytochemistry, osteonectin \nand fibronectin (FN) expression at 6 days in vitro, and we quantified \nfocal adhesions with paxillin. On the other hand, rd1 mixed cultures \nwere seeded on culture dishes previously treated or not with ECM \nenriched conditioned medium (CM). We analyzed rd1 MGC mor -\nphology, proliferation and photoreceptor survival (using BrdU and \nDAPI respectively). Our preliminary results showed a decrease in \nosteonectin expression, an alteration in FN expression, and a de -\ncrease in number and length of focal adhesions in rd1 MGC when \ncompared to the wt condition. Instead, the pretreatment with CM \npromoted rd1 MGC cytoplasmatic extension, increased glial cell \nproliferation, decreased the number of neurons with pyknotic and \nfragmented nuclei, and decreased the Neuron/MGC ratio by 26.9%. \nThese results indicate that rd1 MGC display alterations in EMC pro -\ntein synthesis and/or secretion, and that EMC supplementation im -\nproves MGC morphology and functionality.\n430.

However, its clinical use in long-term \nchronic pain treatment is limited by the enormous addictive potential. \nThe co-administration of morphine with other drugs that enhance the \nanalgesic effect and reduce its reinforcing properties, could be an \nalternative in pain treatment with opioids.\nIn the present study, we propose to determine the lower effective \ndose of morphine to ameliorate the nociceptive threshold by using \nthe partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) in male and female Balb/C \nmice, a widely used model of neuropathic pain. The Von Frey test \n(VFT) was performed in order to evaluate mechanical allodynia by \ncalculating the nociceptive threshold (g). First, mice were habitu -\nated to the environment of the experiment during 4 days. After the \nhabituation period, baseline responses were measured and surgery \nof the right paw was performed in a group of animals with PSNL \n(PSNL group), and surgery without PSNL was executed in another \ngroup (Sham group). On day 9 after surgery, VFT was performed \nafter administration of morphine (1, 3, 9 mg / kg, i.p.) or saline solu -\ntion as vehicle.\nFinally, three-factor ANOVA (sex, surgery, treatment) was applied \nwith Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test, using a p <0.05 as statistically significant.\nOur results showed that morphine (1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg) was able \nto reduce neuropathic pain in male and female mice, respectively \n(p < 0.05). The sexual dimorphism observed herein, confirms the \nlower sensitivity of females compared to males in the antinociceptive \nresponse of morphine.\nThe lower effective doses of morphine determined in male and fe -\nmale mice by a neuropathic pain model, will allow us to continue \nwith our research in order to evaluate potential therapeutic targets \nto enhance the analgesic effect of opiates, reducing or preventing \nthe addictive properties.\n431.

Interestingly, there have not been \nstudies that show whether group dynamics alter the way individuals \nreact to a drug. These dynamics may be highly influential on the \npossibility of an individual becoming addicted to a certain substance.\nNicotine rewarding properties have been assessed in zebrafish us -\ning a biased conditioned place preference (CPP) protocol. In the \npresent study, we aimed to evaluate whether individuals exposed \nto nicotine as a group developed different responses to those of \nindividuals exposed to the substance in isolation (\u201cclassic\u201d CPP) and \nwhether these responses varied in accordance to the concentration \nof nicotine to which they were exposed.\nBy exposing fish to either a grouped or an isolated CPP Protocol \nour preliminary results seem to show that Nicotine elicits a stron -\nger, more robust CPP when being exposed to the drug as a group \n(Nicotine 15mg/L). When Nicotine concentration is raised to 50mg/L, \nhowever, the animals exposed as a group show negative CPP \nscores in comparison to their isolated exposure counterparts. These \nresults may indicate that grouped exposure enhanced the effects of \nnicotine to a point that higher concentrations resulted in an exacer -\nbation of its negative, anxiogenic effects, outweighing it\u2019s reward -\ning, anxiolytic properties. When nicotine exposure was coupled with \nPhenylbutirate, an HDAC inhibitor that has been proven to arrest the \ndevelopment of CPP in isolated animals, blocking the unfolding of \nCPP in a group-enhanced CPP protocol resulted in a positive CPP \nscore at higher concentrations (50mg/L) whereas the isolated CPP ABSTRACTS209\nprotocol still showed negative results regardless of concentration.\nIn conclusion, our results seem to elucidate a novel approach to \nalter nicotine rewarding properties that is neither invasive nor phar -\nmacological but solely through social stimuli.\nONCOLOG\u00cdA\n432.

The methyltransferase \nSMYD2 is an epigenetic modifier frequently upregulated in tumors \nthat has been pointed out as a potential therapeutic target. Our aim \nwas to explore the therapeutic potential of SMYD2 pharmacological \ninhibition in HCC.\nMethods:  SMYD2 expression, its correlation with clinical prognosis \nand transcriptional programs relevant to the disease were explored \nin HCC using TCGA, ICGC and GSE1542 databases. The effect of \nLLY507, an SMYD2 inhibitor, on HCC cells survival, cell cycle and \napoptosis were assessed by standard MTT assay and flow cytom -\netry. RNA-Seq analysis of HuH7 cells treated with LLY507 and their \ncorrelation with HCC datasets were used to characterize the under -\nlying mechanism upon SMYD2 inhibition.\n Results : We observed that SMYD2 is upregulated in the tumoral vs \nnon-tumoral tissue and correlates with a poor prognosis when highly \nexpressed in HCC. Additionally, we found that SMYD2 expression \nnegatively correlates with a set of genes linked to immune-related \nprocesses, apoptosis, and MAPK pathway, and that are downregu -\nlated in HCC. The pharmacological inhibition of SMYD2 by LLY507 \nshowed a potent in vitro antitumoral effect, induced cell cycle arrest \nand apoptosis. Finally, RNA-seq of LLY507-treated HCC cells re -\nvealed the downregulation of aggressive, cell cycle-related genes, \nas well as the upregulation of immune genes that correlate nega -\ntively with SMYD2.\nConclusions:  The bioinformatic analysis of public HCC datasets \nshowed that SMYD2 can be considered a new therapeutic target \nfor HCC. The targeted inhibition of SMYD2 by LLY507 has a potent \nantiproliferative effect on HCC cells and reverts an oncogenic tran -\nscriptional program. These data suggest that inhibition of SMYD2 \nmerits further investigation as a therapeutic target in HCC.\n433.

Novel strategies to control \nit, like radiotherapy as altered fractionation or in combination with \nchemotherapy, are therefore necessary. We have previously shown \nan increase in the DNA damage by the histone deacetylase inhibi -\ntors (HDACi) valproic acid (VA) in irradiated ATC cells. HDACi have emerged recently as promising anticancer agents. Their antitumor \nactivity has been linked to their ability to induce gene expression \nthrough acetylation of histone and nonhistone proteins. DNA dou -\nble-strand breaks (DSBs) are the lethal lesions induced by ioniz -\ning radiation and the majority is repaired by either non-homologous \nend-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). The modu -\nlation of DNA damage repair by HDACi could be one of the under -\nlying mechanisms for the radiosensitizing effect in cancer cell lines. \nObjectives:  To study the mechanism of the radiosensitizing effect \nof valproic acid in an anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line (8505c). \nMethods:  Cells were incubated with 1 mM VA and irradiated with \na source of gamma rays. Radiation response was analyzed by clo -\nnogenic assay. Gene expression was assessed by real time PCR \nat 30 min and 4 hours after irradiation. Results:  A radiosensitizing \neffect was observed with a reduction of survival fraction at 2 Gy \nfrom 0.28 to 0.20 in the treated cells (p<0.05). The expression of \nthe genes of the NHEJ pathway Ku80 (p<0.01), Ku70 (p<0.001) and \nDNA-PKc\u2019s (p<0.01) was downregulated 4 hours after irradiation by \nVA. Moreover, when we studied the expression of the HR\u00b4s genes, \nwe observed a significant downregulation in Mre11 (p<0.01) and \nRPA2 genes (p<0.05). On the contrary, no significant changes were \nobtained for the expression of BRCA2 and Rad51. Conclusion:  Our \nresults suggest that VA could lower the cell\u00b4s capacity to repair radi -\nation-induced DNA damage by affecting the DNA repair pathways, \nNHEJ and HR.\n434.

It has been associated with tumor sup -\npressor mechanisms as well as a resistance mechanism to evade \ntumor eradication. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is part of the secretome of se -\nnescent cells denominated senescence associated secretory phe -\nnotype (SASP). \nIn previous work we demonstrated the relevance of the intracellular \nIL-6 signaling in vitro  and in vivo  in a model of senescent pituitary \ntumor cells. In this work we focus on the characterization of this sig -\nnaling in a natural and therapy-induced senescent model. \nIn MtT/S cells, a naturally senescent pituitary somatotroph cell line, \nto discriminate the effect of intracellular action of IL-6 we inhibited \nsecretory pathway using two independent approaches: a) overex -\npression of a dominant negative form of Rab11 which is a key mol -\necule in anterograde transport, involved in IL-6 associated vesicle \nexocytosis and b) treatment with brefeldin A  (BFA) 100 ng/ml, a drug \nthat blocks intracellular vesicle transport from endoplasmic reticu -\nlum to Golgi.\nIn both cases we observed an increase in the senescent biomarkers \npRb and p16INK4 (measured by western blot) and the activity of se -\nnescence associated \u03b2 galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-Gal) (n=4, p<0.05). To \ninvestigate the subcellular localization of the molecules involved, we \nperformed confocal images of MtT/s cells transfected with fluores -\ncent tagged plasmids of IL-6 and IL-6 receptor and observed spatial \nassociation of both with structures related to anterograde traffic.\nWe next studied another model of senescence, therapy-induced se -\nnescent pulmonary A549 cells treated with doxorubicin (Dox) 132 \nnM. In these cells stimulation and retention of IL-6 (verified by west -\nern blot) with IL-1\u03b2 20 ng/ml and BFA also increases the senescent \nprofile according to the biomarkers: increase in p21Cip1 and decrease \nin pRb.\nWe conclude that IL-6 regulates senescence through a specific in -\ntracellular signaling pathway that could represent a general mecha -MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

(048) DELTA-TOCOTRIENOL ENHANCES THE ANTITU -\nMORAL EFFECTS OF INTERFERON ALPHA THROUGH \nROS PRODUCTION AND ERK PATHWAY IN HEPATOCEL -\nLULAR CARCINOMA CELLS\nLucci A1,2, Vera M2, Comanzo C2, Palma NF2, Ferretti A1, Ce-\nballos MP1,2, Quiroga AD1,2, Alvarez ML1,2, Carrillo MC1,2\n1\u00c1rea Morfolog\u00eda, Facultad de Ciencias Bioqu\u00edmicas y Far -\nmac\u00e9uticas, Universidad Nacional de Rosario y CONICET\n2Instituto de Fisiolog\u00eda Experimental (IFISE), CONICET\nOur group has postulated the supplementation with \u03b4-tocotrienol (E) \nto interferon alpha (IFN) therapy as a strategy to treat liver cancer \nbecause we have shown that the combined treatment inhibits cell \ngrowth and metastatic properties, and increases apoptosis in SK \nHep-1 (SK) and Huh7 hepatocarcinoma (HCC) cell lines.\nIn this work we explored the signaling pathways involved in the stud -\nied processes.\nOur hypothesis is that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Erk ac -\ntivation participate in the effects produced by E supplementation to \nIFN therapy.\nWe treated SK and Huh7 cells with 10000 and 20000 U/I  IFN, re -\nspectively, 25 uM E, or the combination of both drugs (IFN-E-group). \nAlso, we used 4 mM N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a reductor compound, \nand 5 uM PD98059 (PD), an inhibitor of Erk phosphorylation .Treat -\nments were carried out for 72 h. We performed: a) dichlorofluores -\ncein assay to evaluate ROS production, b) western blot studies \nto analyze phospo and total Erk expression, and c) MTT assay to \ndetermine cell viability. Results: IFN-E-group showed a higher in -\ncrease in ROS production in SK (+500%*) and Huh7 (+350%*) cells, \nan increase in phospo Erk/ total Erk ratio (SK: +82%* and Huh7: \n+95%*), and a significant decrease in cell viability (SK:-58%* and \nHuh7:-52%*). The decreases in viability were parcially restored with \nPD (IFN-E-PD-group, SK: -25%#, Huh7: -24%#) and with NAC (IFN-\nE-NAC-group, SK: -27%#, Huh7: -15%#). *p<0.05 vs control; #p<0.05 \nvs IFN-E-group. In summary, we demonstrate that the effects pro -\nduced by the addition of E to IFN therapy are mediated, at least \nin part, by ROS production and Erk pathway. Knowing the mech -\nanisms that operate when cytokines and vitamins are combined to \nreduce tumorigenesis opens potential clinical targets against HCC.\n436.

We performed the MTT assay to determine cell via -\nbility at 72 h, constructing the dose-response curves to calculate the \nIC50 values. Combination index was also calculated (Compusyn). \nBesides, we performed the wound healing assay to determine mi -\ngration at 6 h and invasion assays in transwell chambers at 24 h. The \nresults were tested by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s test (3 \nindependent experiments; n=4 in each one). As expected, IFN-E-\ngroup showed a higher decrease in cell viability (-63%*#) compared to monodrug therapy: IFN-group (-22%*), E-group (-21%*). Combi -\nnation index showed synergism between IFN and E. In the migration \nassay, IFN-E-group did not show a significant decrease (-16 %*) \ncompared to monodrug therapy: IFN-group (-16%*) and E-group \n(-14%*). Finally, IFN-E-group showed a significant diminution in \nthe invasion assay(-96 %* #) compared to monodrug therapy: IFN-\ngroup (-33%*) and E-group (-87%*). * p<0.05 vs C-group; #p<0.05 \nvs monotherapies. In summary, we demonstrate that addition of E to \nIFN therapy reduces proliferation, migration and invasion of human \nEA.hy926 endothelial cells, processes that are necessary for normal \nangiogenesis. In this regard, combined treatment might open a po -\ntential clinical target against angiogenesis in the future.\n \n437.

RhoGT -\nPases switch between on and off states and are regulated by sever -\nal GEFs (activators) and GAPs/RhoGDIs (inactivators).\nThe aim of this work is  to study the role of a particular RhoA-GEF, \nGEF-H1, in  breast cancer (BC) progression. We observed by im -\nmunostaining a significant  increase in GEF-H1 protein expression \nin BC human biopsies compared  with non-tumoral tissue (n=76, \np=0.0287). In addition, GEF-H1 expression correlated  with the inva -\nsive potential of human and murine BC cell  lines. To further study the \nrole of GEF-H1 in tumor  development, we generated GEF-H1- knock \nout (KO) BC cells using  CRISPR/Cas9 technology. A decrease in \nproliferation, migration, invasion and anchorage-independent  colony \nformation rates was observed in GEF-H1-KO cells compared to  wild \ntype (WT) cells (p<0.001). These results correlated with reduced  \nfocal adhesion formation and its downstream signalling. Further -\nmore, BALB/c mice  were subcutaneously inoculated with GEF-H1 \nKO cells, showing a significant  delay in tumor formation (p<0.01) \nand lung metastasis development compared  with mice inoculated \nwith WT cells.\nThese results demonstrate that GEF-H1-RhoA activation mediates \nthe signalling pathways involved in controlling cell proliferation, mi -\ngration and invasion of BC cells. In vivo assays and human biopsies \nstudies suggest that GEF-H1 expression in BC cells might indeed \ncontribute to tumor progression.\n438.

Cisplatin has been \neffective for the treatment of different solid tumors, including OS. \nHowever, cisplatin treatment often results in the development of \nchemoresistance and several side effects, leading to therapeutic \nfailure. In this sense, copper compounds have shown to be poten -\ntially effective as antitumor agents, attracting increasing interest as \nalternatives to usually employed platinum derived drugs.\nThe aim of this work is to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo  antitumor -\nal activity against MG-63 cells of the nitrate salt of a novel Cu(II) \ncationic complex containing a tridentate hydrazone ligand, Cu(HL) ABSTRACTS211\nfor short.\nCytotoxic activity on MG-63 cell line was evaluated in 2D (mono -\nlayer) and 3D (spheroids) models. Cu(HL) significantly reduced cell \nviability after 24 h treatment in both models (IC50 2D: 1.98 \u00b1 0.51 \n\u00b5M; 3D: 9.05 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b5M) (p<0.001). Further studies demonstrated \nthat Cu(HL) inhibits cell proliferation and conveys cells to apoptosis, \ndetermined by flow cytometry. Cu(HL) showed a great genotoxicity, \nevaluated by comet assay. \nFinally, we assessed in vivo  anticancer activity in animals bearing \ngrowing OS s.c. xenografts. Treatment during 4 weeks with Cu(HL) \n(2 mg/kg i.p. three times per week) markedly impaired tumor pro -\ngression, enhancing necrosis and reducing tumor growth rate and \nmitotic index (p<0.01). Treatment with an equivalent low dose of \nreference metallodrug cisplatin (2 mg/kg i.p. three times per week) \nfailed to inhibit tumor growth. \nTaken together, these results show that Cu(HL) has a promising an -\nticancer activity against in vitro  and in vivo  OS models. \n439.

Additional genetic lesions \nled to the most recent WHO classification that allows stratification \nin four tumor entities, mIDH gliomas [Oligodendrogliomas (OD) and \nAstrocytomas (AA)], and wtIDH gliomas: [Glioblastoma (GBM)-like \nand GBM]. While mIDH clearly correlates with better prognosis, the \nrole of this mutation in antitumor immunity remains controversial. \nFirst, we predicted the level of infiltrating immune and stroma cells \nby ESTIMATE scores and both were significantly lower in mIDH \npatients. We also found reduced expression of immunoregulatory \ngenes (PD-LI, PD-1, CTLA-4, IDO1, IL-10, LAG3 and TIM3) in mIDH \nbiopsies (p<0.05, vs. wtIDH). Moreover, PD-L1 exhibited a strong \nnegative correlation with mIDH1 in the whole set of mIDH gliomas \n(p<0.05). However, within this group, this correlation is completely \nlost in AA (Spearman r: 0.06) in comparison with OD (Spearman r: \n-0.46, p<0.05). The analysis of gene signatures of tumor-infiltrating \nimmune cells indicated that lymphocyte populations and antigen \npresenting cells were downregulated in mIDH tumors (p<0.05, vs. \nwtIDH). However, once again, we found differences within the mIDH \ngroup, suggesting that OD exhibit an even colder immunophenotype \nthan AA. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between the expres -\nsion of IDH1 and MGMT or ATM, DNA repair enzymes that affect \nchemo- and radio-resistance, respectively. We found a significantly \nnegative correlation between IDH1 and MGMT that is lost in GBM bi -\nopsies. In contrast, IDH1 exhibited a significantly positive correlation \nwith ATM in mIDH gliomas but a negative one in GBM. Our observa -\ntions suggest that the immune landscape of gliomas not only differs \ndue to mIDH status, but also within glioma subtypes, supporting the \nidea that the overall effect of this genetic lesion depends on the cel -\nlular context.\n440.

In view of the thera -\npeutic challenge associated with PDAC, we set out to search and \ncharacterize approved drugs that inhibit cAMP transport with the \ngoal of establishing a repositioning strategy. Based on the results \nof this screening, we selected the Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs) as an interesting pharmacological family to inquire \nfor rational drug repositioning. NSAIDs have been tested in the past \nas co-adjuvants in the therapy of various types of cancer, in many \ncases with positive results. Although their effects that depend on \ncyclooxygenase-2 inhibition are well described, the effects that are \nindependent of this inhibition are far for being clear. We hypothesize \nthat MRP4 inhibition could be a missing link in the overall action on \ntumor progression of these compounds. In this work, we measure \nthe intracellular cAMP response upon treatment with 13 different \nNSAIDs using a technique developed in our laboratory in which \nwe use HEK-293T cells stably transfected with the EPAC-SH187 \nsensor. Ibuprofen, acetyilsalicylic acid, Naproxen, Indomethacin, \nDiclofenac, Dexketoprofen and Ketorolac have shown to increase \nintracellular cAMP concentrations upon treatment ( p<0.01). The \nconcomitant significant reduction of extracellular cAMP upon treat -\nment with these NSAIDs was also measured using a Radio-Binding \nProtein assay (RBP), which confirmed cAMP transport inhibition as \none of the mechanisms that triggers intracellular cAMP increment \n(p<0.05). On the other hand, Celecoxib, Acetaminophen, Dipyrone, \nPhenacetin, Meloxicam and Piroxicam failed to increase intracellu -\nlar cAMP upon treatment. These emerging results, together with an \nexhaustive literature search will allow us to select our repositioning \ncandidates to continue with its characterization regarding its thera -\npeutic potential in PDAC.\n441.

Roffo, \nUniversidad de Buenos Aires.\nIntroduction: Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most common and ag -\ngressive brain tumors. Despite the traditional chemotherapy with \ntemozolomide (TMZ) and radiotherapy, patients\u2019 survival does not \nexceed 2 years. It has been suggested that the selective inhibition \nof inducible nitric oxide synthase isoform (iNOS) enzyme is related \nto a decreased proliferation of GBM cells.\nObjective:  Evaluate the effect of iNOS specific inhibitor, S-methyli -\nsothiourea (SMT), alone or in combination with TMZ, on GBM stem \ncell (GSC) niche (spheres) and on more differentiated cells (mono -\nlayer and spheroids).\nMethodology:  Human GBM cell lines LN229, U251 and U87 were \nseeded in monolayer, as spheroides (hanging drop aggregation \nassay) and under sphere conditions (low adhesion and high dilu -\ntion). Viability in 2D was determined by MTS. For spheroids\u2019 growth \nmonitoring, they were measured in their diameter every week using \nimageJ. The number of GSC was established by sphere forming \nefficiency (SFE) in relation to the seeded cells, and the diameter of \nthe spheres was also measured.\nResults:  In monolayer and in spheroids, SMT (50 \u00b5M) marginally \nreduced LN229 cell line growth (20-5% inhibition); however, in GSC \nniche, it decreased significantly the SFE in the three lines (inhibition, \nLN229 42%; U251 61%; U87 48%) and their diameters (inhibition, \n33%, 17% and 28%, respectively). The combination of SMT (50 \u00b5M) \nwith TMZ (250 \u00b5M), further inhibited SFE (LN229 57%, U251 70%, \nU87 50%) compared to SMT or TMZ alone.\nConclusion:   iNOS inhibitor in combination with TMZ therapy, could \nbe useful in reducing GSC growth . Further studies on mechanisms \nof action will establish the differences observed between different \nGBM cell lines.MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021212\n442.

Their \nclassification into low (LGG) or high grade gliomas (HGG) may re -\nflect survival odds. Molecular techniques enable more accurate di-\nagnostic results and risk stratification. Molecular alterations in BRAF \ngene and histone 3 genes (H3) were evaluated by FISH, IHC and \nSanger sequencing, in 102 pediatric glial and glioneuronal tumors. \nBRAF and/or H3 were assessed in LGG or HGG according to WHO \nrecommendations. Results were correlated with clinical and histo -\nlogical findings to evaluate them as diagnostic and prognostic tools.\nThe KIAA1549-BRAF gene fusion was relevant as a diagnostic tool \nfor Pilocytic astrocytoma, a LGG,(43/64 cases), but was not related \nto progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (Kaplan \nMeier, Log-rank\n(Mantel-Cox) Test; P>0.05). This fusion showed no association with \ndifferent age groups (10\n< years old \u2265 10, Fisher\u2019s exact test; P>0.05), but was more preva -\nlent in the cerebellum (Chi square test; P=0.04). The BRAFV600E \nmutation occurred preferentially in the brain hemispheres 7/10 cas -\nes (Fisher\u00b4s exact test; P=0.004) and was associated with a shorter \nOS (P=0.0082), but not with a decreased PFS (P=0.14) in LGG. \nWhen only considering Pilocytic astrocytomas, it was associated \nwith a decreased OS and PFS (P<0.0001 and P=0.0135, respec -\ntively). All HGG of the midline were positive for H3K27M mutation, \nwhile the H3G34R mutant cases were located in brain hemispheres. \nThe H3K27M mutation in HGG was associated with decreased PFS \nand OS (P=0.0124 and P=0.006, respectively).\nAssessing druggable molecular markers with prognostic value is of \nparamount importance particularly in those cases where complete \nresection or further radiation therapy is not possible due to critical-lo -\ncation of the tumor.\n443.

Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (CONI -\nCET), Argentina. \nOsteosarcoma (OS) is considered a clinical challenge due to its \nrapid progression and limited response to therapy. Despite being a \nfirst-line therapeutic strategy for OS, methotrexate (MTX), specially \nat high doses, can cause significant toxicity, including myelosup -\npression, nephro- and hepatotoxicity. In this context, the addition of \ncost-effective repurposed agents such as the non-selective \u03b2-block -er propranolol (PPN) or the antiparasitic drug ivermectin (IVM), \ncould potentiate the therapeutic anticancer activity of MTX in OS, at \nlower and better tolerated doses.\nThe aim of this work was to evaluate the in vitro  antitumoral activity \nof MTX in combination with PPN or IVM on highly aggressive MG-63 \nand U-2OS human OS cells.  \nSensitivity to PPN, IVM and MTX was assessed obtaining IC50 val -\nues of 45.6 \u00b5M, 8.3 \u00b5M and 8.6 nM for MG-63 and 47 \u00b5M, 12.8 \n\u00b5M, and 58.6 nM for U-2OS cells, respectively. After 72h treatments, \nexponential growth of OS cells was significantly abrogated after \ncombining different optimal and suboptimal concentrations of both \nPPN or IVM plus MTX. However, stronger synergistic cytostatic ef -\nfects (CI<1) and consistency among experimental OS models were \nobserved after the addition of PPN to MTX. Furthermore, a potent \ninhibitory effect on MG-63 cell chemotaxis was observed combining \nPPN (50 \u00b5M) with MTX (10 nM), reducing migratory capacity by 50% \nin comparison to vehicle-treated cells ( p<0,0001). At a metabolic lev -\nel, lactate production rates were also inhibited, reducing final lactate \nconcentration by nearly 30% after a 24h treatment using PPN+MTX \n(p<0,0001). Finally, by using suboptimal concentrations of PPN (10 \n\u00b5M) with MTX (1 nM), colony-forming ability and clonogenic growth \nwere inhibited by 30% and 60%, respectively ( p<0,0001). \nThese preliminary studies show synergistic activity of MTX plus IVM \nor specially PPN in OS human cells. Further preclinical research \nevaluating different dosing schemes in vivo  is warranted.  \n444.

In particular, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is \ncharacterized by high cellular and molecular heterogeneity. Recent \nresearch has reported that AHCYL1 (adenosylhomocysteinase-like \n1) protein could be involved in the regulation of autophagy and tu -\nmor cell proliferation processes. We have previously shown that \nAHCYL1-depleted cells have higher tumorigenic capacity; however, \nthe expression and the potential role of AHCYL1 in lung cancer re -\nmain unclear. We explored the expression of AHCYL1 and Ki67 (a \ncell proliferation marker and indicator for poor prognosis in many \ncancers) in patients with NSCLC by immunohistochemical analysis; \nalong with transcriptomic data analysis of public databases. RNA-\nseq data revealed that AHCYL1 is expressed in all stages of lung \ncancer, and notably, it shows an inverse correlation with the ex -\npression of stemness-related genes. Proliferation marker Ki67 also \nshowed an inverse correlation with AHCYL1 (p<0.0001). At the pro -\ntein level, the examination of 26 primary NSCLCs samples, mainly \nadenocarcinomas, revealed that AHCYL1 expression was inversely \ncorrelated with the histologic tumor grade score (p=0.011) and Ki67 \nexpression (p=0.002). These results indicate that AHCYL1 is mainly \nexpressed in low-grade and less proliferative tumors. Future investi -\ngation of the role of AHCYL1 will give an insight as a potential thera -\npeutic target for the treatment of lung adenocarcinomas.\n445.

Con -\nsidering that half of the patient\u2019s exhibit the BRAFV600E mutation, \ntherapies with BRAF and MEK inhibitors (BRAFi/MEKi) showed  an \nimpressive success rate. Unfortunately, treatments are marginally \neffective since  tumors quickly become resistant. In that regard, ac -\ncumulating evidence supports  that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) \nis linked to multiple mechanisms leading to  cancer progression and \nresistance. Thus, the aim of this study  was to evaluate how vemu -\nrafenib (BRAFi) resistance affects the expression  of sphingosine ki -\nnases (SphK) and S1P receptors (S1PR) in melanoma.  To this end, \nwe generated vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells by continuous  \nexposure of parental sensitive cells to increasing concentrations \n(0,01\u00b5M \u2013  1\u00b5M) of the drug for 3 months. Previously, we showed  \nthat vemurafenib-resistant Lu1205 melanoma cell (Lu1205R) exhibit \nhigher IC50 and  pERK levels than their sensitive parents (Lu1205S). \nHere, we extended  those studies to A375 melanoma cells. Certain -\nly, A375R cells also  showed increased resistance and pERK, but \nnot pAKT levels. Expression  of SphK and S1PR in both cells lines \nwas evaluated  by RT-qPCR. Surprisingly, the modulation of SphK1, \nS1PR1 and S1PR3  expression differ in Lu1205R and A375R cells. \nIn addition, a  bioinformatic analysis was performed using the public \nGene Expression Omnibus  (GEO) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.\nnih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE24862). This study  showed \na differential gene expression pattern in other cell lines, including \nA375, supporting the concept that melanoma heterogeneity may \ntrigger different mechanisms of resistance to BRAFi therapy. In sum-\nmary, although our results indicate that S1P signaling may have a \nrole in vemurafenib resistance, further studies will be necessary to \nelucidate its importance.\n446.

Here, we sought to identify key met -\nabolic genes that fuel prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastasis. By \nan indirect transwell co-culture system of PCa (PC3) and bone pro -\ngenitor cells (MC3T3 or Raw264.7) we assessed the transcriptomic \nprofile of PC3 cells modulated by soluble factors released from bone \nprecursors. Strong activation of lipid metabolic pathways including \nPPAR and PI3K-Akt (P<0.05) was observed in PC3 cells. Next, we \nselected the altered metabolic genes for an unsupervised cluster -\ning analysis using transcriptomic data from human PCa and bone \nmetastasic samples (GSE74685). Interestingly, those genes could \ncluster PCa patients in two defined groups: primary PCa and bone \nmetastasis, highlighting that the early transcriptional metabolic alter -\nations triggered in our co-culture model could discriminate primary \ntumors from bone metastatic samples. Further, the expression levels \nof four lipid associated genes ( VDR , PPARA , SLC16A1  and GPX1 ) \ncould be independent risk-predictors of death (HR: 4.96, 2.85, 3.93 \nand 3.67, respectively; P<0.05), and that the combined expression \nof these four genes correlates with a worst outcome in metastatic patients (HR: 2.65, P<0.05) (SU2C-PCF data set). Further, we iden -\ntified PKA as a master regulator of this lipid-associated signature \n(Ingenuity Pathway Analysis). Secretome analysis (ESI MS/MS) of \nconditioned media from these co-cultures revealed critical soluble \nfactors secreted by bone progenitors (Col1a2, Fn1 and Cacna2d1) \nwhich could regulate PKA activity to promote the metabolic rewiring \nof PCa cells. Overall, we identified a novel lipid gene signature trig -\ngered during the communication between PCa and bone cells that \nappears to be critical for survival in PCa patients, pointing out to new \nattractive druggable targets for the disease.\n447.

In \nthis work, we comparatively examined its mechanism of action in \nmurine B16-F0 and human A375 melanoma cells. We first studied \nthe contribution of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response \nto the apoptotic effect induced by the derivative. To this end, the \nexpression levels of different ER stress-related proteins were eval -\nuated by Western blot assays in both melanoma cell lines. A signifi -\ncant increase in the amount of ATF4 (\u22481.5-2 fold), GADD153/CHOP \n(\u22481.5-2.5 fold), Calnexin (\u22482 fold) and GRP78/BIP (\u22482-3.5 fold) was \nobserved after incubating B16-F0 cells for 3 h or 6 h with a 20 \u00b5M \nconcentration of TAP7f (p<0.05). A similar effect was observed in \nA375 cells for some of these ER markers. It was also demonstrat -\ned that TAP7f-induced activation of p38, JNK and PI3K-I/Akt sig -\nnaling pathways occurred downstream ER stress. Based on the \neffectiveness of combined therapies for cancer treatment, we de -\ncided to investigate the in vitro  antiproliferative effect of TAP7f with \nthapsigargin, a well-known ER stress activator. The simultaneous \nincubation of different concentrations of the two compounds showed \na higher inhibition of cell growth with respect to the effect of each in -\ndividual agent, both in B16-F0 and A375 melanoma cells. The quan -\ntitative analysis of dose-effect curves obtained by using Compusyn \nsoftware rendered combination indexes lower than 1 (0.48-0.59 for \nB16-F0 and 0.41-0.76 for A375), indicating synergism (p<0.01). In \nconclusion, we showed that induction of ER stress and activation of \np38, JNK and PI3K-I/Akt pathways are involved in the antitumor ef -\nfect induced by TAP7f in melanoma cells. The efficacy of the combi -\nnation of TAP7f with thapsigargin suggested that this therapy could \nbe considered an auspicious tool for melanoma treatment.\n448.

Multiplicity of in -\nfection (MOI) ranging from 100 to 750 was used. 6 h after virus in -\nfection, cells were incubated with complete media for 24-48 h.

Several studies have discussed the fact that a \ndietary restriction, such as in ketogenic diets (KD), impairs tumor \ngrowth rate, however, the intricacy of metabolic pathways associated \nwith PCa progression remains elusive. Here, using PCa patient-de -\nrived xenografts (PDXs) mimicking the response of the human do -\nnor to ADT, we performed a comprehensive metabolomic analysis \nof PCa PDXs that relapsed following castration. We discovered a \nmetabolic shift from high glycolytic activity to exacerbated ketone \nbody (KB) metabolism. These results indicated that a subpopulation \nof CRPCs that progresses with partial or complete loss of AR depen -\ndence are fueled by KB. We confirmed (IHC) that the expression of \ncritical ketolytic enzymes ( ACAT1 , OXCT1 , BDH)  was significantly \naugmented after castration-resistant progression in both the PDX \ntumor and its human donor tissue (P<0.05). Further, in an in silico  \napproach (n=986), increased expression of ketolytic enzymes was \nalso observed for a subset of PCa patients that relapsed with low \nAR and ERG expression. Moreover, expression of these factors was \nalso associated with decreased time to biochemical relapse and de -\ncreased progression-free survival.\nIn summary, our studies reveal KB as key metabolites fueling castra -\ntion resistant progression in the context of a partial or complete loss \nof AR dependence. This subpopulation of PCas with high ketolytic enzymes may influence the effectiveness of a KD. Thus, assessing \nin combination both, the KB content and the expression levels of \nthese enzymes, may be crucial in stratifying PCa patients for which \na KD may prove unsuccessful to halt disease progression.\n450.

Preclinical data show \nthat compound triggers cytostatic mechanisms in malignant cells, \nimpairing angiogenesis and metastatic progression. It is known that \ntriple-negative breast  cancer  (TNBC)  is  associated  to  poor  prog -\nnosis due to limited response to therapy and metastatic relapse. \nConsidering the unsatisfied clinical needs of TNBC, we evaluated \nthe antitumoral activity of dDAVP on aggressive preclinical models \nof TNBC alone or in addition to chemotherapy. For that purpose, \nwe used human (MDA-MB-231; MDA-MB-468) and murine (F3II) \nTNBC cells. MCF-7 cells were used as a hormonedependent less \naggressive model.\nIn vitro , dDAVP significantly reduced clonogenic and 3D growth, via -\nbility and chemotaxis of AVPR2-expressing TNBC. Cytostatic effects \nof dDAVP were associat-ed to altered  actin cytoskeleton dynamics \nand differen-tial expression of migration, angiogenesis  and  me -\ntastasis-related  genes.  In  the  MCF-7  cell  line  we  ob-tained \nequivalent results. \nIn silico , we demonstrated a positive prognostic impact of AVPR2 \nexpression in Basallike BC and we assessed the AVPR2 target \nexpression in TNBC xenografts and clinical BC samples.  Using \nsyngenic and xenogenic animal models synergistic effects were ob -\nserved after combining dDAVP with taxane or alkylating therapy. In \nmice bearing TNBC tumors combined therapy resulted in greater \ninhibition of tumor progression, reduction of skin infiltration and met -\nastatic spread to lungs. Statistical analyses were performed using \nthe PRISM8, T-test or ANOVA, p<0.05\nIn conclusion, agonist activation of AVPR2 using dDAVP represents \nan achievable and interesting therapeutic approach to modulate \nTNBC aggressiveness. dDAVP could be used as a coadyuvant \nagent for treating this disease, not only in combination with chemo -\ntherapy but also administered during the perioperative setting.\n \n451. (113) IN VITRO EXPLORATION OF DIFFERENT REPUR -\nPOSED AGENTS FOR COLORECTAL CANCER TREAT -\nMENT: SYNERGISTIC COMBINATIONS AS POTENTIAL \nCO-ADJUVANT STRATEGIES\nSobol NT1;2;3, Solern\u00f3 L1;2;3, Gottardo MF1;2;3, Segatori VI1;2;3, \nYonamine K3;4, Curvale C3;4, Matan\u00f3 R4, Saenz J3;5, Vogel E3;5, \nTassi V5, Alonso DF1;2;3, Garona J1;2;3\n1Centro de Oncolog\u00eda Molecular y Traslacional, Universidad \nNacional de Quilmes, 2CONICET,3Centro de Medicina Tras -\nlacional (Unidad 6), Hospital de Alta Complejidad \u201cEl Cruce\u201d. \n4Servicio de Gastroenterolog\u00eda; Hospital de Alta Complejidad \n\u201cEl Cruce\u201d, 5Servicio de Anotom\u00eda Patol\u00f3gica; Hospital de \nAlta Complejidad \u201cEl Cruce\u201d.\nMetastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) still stands as a challenge for \npublic health. In this setting, repurposed drugs arise as cost-effec -\ntive co-adjuvants strategies to the standard chemotherapy regimens \nfor mCRC. Considering the wide variety of therapeutic benefits pre -\nviously reported for other tumor types, we aimed at exploring the \nantitumor activity of five rationally selected repurposing drugs; iv -\nermectin (IVM), atorvastatin (ATV), benznidazole (BDZ), propran -ABSTRACTS215\nolol and losartan in aggressive CRC CT-26 cells. In vitro  sensitivity \nto the selected compounds was assessed on rapidly growing cell \ncultures finding heterogenous IC50 values ranging between 10-800 \n\u00b5M. Combinational studies were carried out with IVM, ATV and BDZ \nbased on their clinically-relevant IC50 values and their known impact \non drug resistance reversal, immune modulation and hypoxia-acti -\nvated cytotoxicity. The addition of IVM to ATV, exerted a synergic \ninhibitory effect ( combination index  <1, Compusyn software) over \nthe proliferation of CRC cells, while combined treatment of IVM and \nBDZ in a hypoxic setting did not provide further therapeutic benefit. \nCombined concentrations of IVM and ATV at a low \u00b5M range were \nalso found to reduce 75% of transwell cell migration, to completely \nabrogate low-density cell growth, as well as significantly decrease \nglucose uptake and lactate production. IVM (1 \u00b5M) plus ATV (5 \u00b5M) \ndramatically impaired clonogenic growth, alone or combined with \noxaliplatin (1 \u00b5M), improving the cytotoxic monotherapy by nearly \n25% (ANOVA, p<0.05) On a preliminary safety protocol in Balb/c \nmice, the administration of concomitant i.p. IVM (10 \u00b5g/kg) and ATV \n(20 \u00b5g/kg) thrice-weekly, was well tolerated and no signs of toxicity \nwere observed. As a conclusion, IVM and ATV are interesting candi -\ndates for further in vivo preclinical exploration as co-adjuvant agents \nfor CRC management, focusing their potential to modulate the tumor \nstroma and metastatic spread.\n452. (114) NICOTINIC MODULATION OF THE RESPONSE TO \nPACLITAXEL IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER \nCELLS \nYamila Sanchez, Agustina Salem, Jaqueline Obreg\u00f3n, Mar\u00eda \nElena Sales, Alejandro Espa\u00f1ol\nCEFYBO-CONICET-UBA, CABA, Argentina.\nPrevious evidences pointed to the participation of nicotinic acetyl -\ncholine receptors (nAChRs) in the effect of paclitaxel (PX) as an \nantitumor agent in lung cancer. However, less knowledge is avail -\nable regarding the actions of PX on nAChRs in nearby organs such \nas those of the breasts. The addition of nicotine (NIC) confirmed \nthe presence of functional nAChRs in mammary cells which me -\ndiated an increment in cell viability measured by MTT assay. This \neffect was more potent in MDA-MB231 triple negative tumor cells \n(189\u00b12%) than in MCF-10A non-tumor cells (145\u00b17%; p<0.001) and \nwas blunted by nicotinic antagonists (10-6M). We also confirmed that \nPX triggers tumor breast cell death in a concentration dependent \nmanner, but the presence of NIC (10-10M) totally reverted the ac -\ntion of PX CE50 (4x10-7M) (p<0.001).  The effect of NIC was also \nreduced by the presence of non-selective nicotinic antagonist, or \n\u03b17 and \u03b19 selective nicotinic antagonists, and also by the inhibi -\ntion of protein kinase C, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 or NF-kB pathways linked \nto nAChRs (p<0.05). Apoptosis contributes in part to death action \nof PX on tumor cells. By flow cytometry we confirmed that PX in -\ncreased apoptosis (control:6.1\u00b10.7%, PX:16.7\u00b11.4%; p<0.05) in \nMDA-MB231 cells which was significantly reduced by NIC treat -\nment (10.3\u00b11.6%; p<0.05). In conclusion, the activation of nAChRs \nincreases breast cell proliferation and could be responsible either \nof tumorigenesis or malignization; it should be considered that NIC \nreduces PX effectiveness in tumor treatment probably due to an in -\ncrement in the resistance to chemotherapy. \n453. (127) INHIBITION OF HO-1 ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY IM -\nPAIRS HEAD AND NECK CANCER CELL SURVIVAL\nMascar\u00f3 M1, Alonso EG1, Schweitzer K1, Fernandez Chavez \nL1, Ferronato MJ1, Ibarra A1, Col\u00f3 GP1, Giorgi G2, Curino AC1, \nFacchinetti MM1\n1Laboratorio de Biolog\u00eda del C\u00e1ncer, Instituto de Investiga -\nciones Bioqu\u00edmicas Bah\u00eda Blanca (INIBIBB), Universidad Na -\ncional del Sur (UNS)-CONICET, Departamento de Biolog\u00eda, \nBioqu\u00edmica y Farmacia (UNS), Bah\u00eda Blanca , Argentina.\n2Laboratorio de Fisiolog\u00eda Humana, Departamento de Biolo -\ng\u00eda, Bioqu\u00edmica y Farmacia, Universidad Nacional del Sur, \nBah\u00eda Blanca, Argentina.\nWe have previously reported that, in human HNSCC samples, \nhemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA expression is up-regulated and it \nis associated with worst survival. We also reported an up-regulation of HO-1 protein levels and that it is localized in the cytoplasmic and \nnuclear compartments. Moreover, we demonstrated that pharma -\ncological activation of HO-1 by hemin and genetic full-length HO-1 \n(FL-HO-1) overexpression increases HN13 cells survival and cell \ncycle progression, suggesting a protumor role of HO-1 in HNSCC. \nHowever, whether byproducts of HO-1 enzymatic activity are in -\nvolved in FL-HO-1 mediated-effects remains unknown. In this study, \nwe aimed to elucidate if inhibition of HO-1 enzymatic activity impacts \non head and neck cancer cells behavior. To that end, HO-1 activity \nwas inhibited pharmacologically using ZnPP and an enzymatically \ninactive FL-H25A-HO1-overexpressing HN13 cell line was estab -\nlished. We evaluated HO-1 expression by western blot and indirect \nimmunofluorescence, cell viability by crystal violet, cell proliferation \nby manual cell counting, cell cycle progression by propidium iodide \nstaining and flow cytometry, and cell migration by wound healing \nassay. We found that 10 \u00b5M ZnPP impaired cell viability (p<0,001 vs \nDMSO) at 48h and 72h as well as it diminished cell number at 72h \n(p<0,01 vs DMSO). Also, in such conditions, ZnPP induces overex -\npression of HO-1, which is localized in the cytoplasm. In line with \nthe previously mentioned, we found that FL-H25A-HO1 HN13 cells \nhave a lower growth rate (p<0,001) than FL-HO1 HN13 cells. We \nalso found that the population of FL-H25A-HO1 HN13 cells have an \nincrease in Go/G1 phase (p<0,01) and a decrease in G2/M phase \n(p<0,05) compared with FL-HO1 HN13 cells. Related to cell migra -\ntion, FL-H25A-HO1 failed to alter migratory capacity (p>0,05 vs FL-\nHO1). In conclusion, our results show that the enzymatic activity \nof HO-1 plays a role in the FL-HO-1-mediated effects on head and \nneck cancer cell survival. \n454. (130) ROLE OF RACOTUMOMAB IMMUNOTHERAPY AND \nN-GLYCOLYLNEURAMINIC ACID (NEUGC)-RICH DIET \nIN CYTIDINE MONOPHOSPHO-N-ACETYLNEURAMINIC \nACID HYDROXILASE (CMAH) KNOCKOUT HUMANIZED \nMICE BEARING LUNG CANCER TUMORS\nValeria In\u00e9s Segatori1, Carla Sabrina Capobianco1, Cynthia \nAntonella Gulino1, Ignacio Demarco2, Gabriel Fern\u00e1ndez \nGra\u00f1a3, Geraldine Schlapp3, Mariano Rolando Gabri1, Mar -\ntina Crispo3, Daniel Fernando Alonso1\n1Centro de Oncolog\u00eda Molecular y Traslacional y Plataforma \nde Servicios Biotecnol\u00f3gicos, Universidad Nacional de Quil -\nmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina; 2MabXience, Gar\u00edn, Argenti -\nna; 3Unidad de Biotecnolog\u00eda en Animales de Laboratorio, \nInstitut Pasteur de Montevideo, Uruguay.\nNeuGc is a sialic acid molecule found in animal cell membranes \nas terminal components of glycoproteins and glycolipids. In most \nmammals including mice and apes, NeuGc synthesis is catalyzed by \nCMAH. However, humans lack such enzyme due to gene inactiva -\ntion, being NeuGc obtained from dietary sources. Although healthy \nhuman tissues contain negligible levels, tumor cells are able to incor -\nporate large amounts of NeuGc. Aggressive human neoplasms such \nas non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can express NeuGc-contain -\ning gangliosides as cell surface neoantigens. The anti-NeuGc an -\nti-idiotype monoclonal antibody racotumomab is approved for switch \nmaintenance immunotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. We \nused CMAH knockout (CMAH-/-) mice to study the antitumor activity \nof racotumomab in the context of a humanized model and to further \nanalyze the role of NeuGc-rich diet. CMAH-/- female mice were in -\noculated i.v. with 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma cells (105 cells/mouse) \nand surface lung nodules were counted 25 days later. Therapeutic \nimmunization with weekly s.c. doses of racotumomab at 200 \u03bcg/\ndose formulated in aluminum hydroxide (racotumomab-alum) exhib -\nited a significant antitumor activity against lung tumor nodules (Con -\ntrol: 14 \u00b1 7 versus Racotumomab-alum: 6.5 \u00b1 2.5, median lung nod -\nules per mouse \u00b1 interquartile range; p<0.01, Mann-Whitney test) in \nCMAH-/- mice fed ad libitum with a NeuGc-rich diet, containing beef \nfat and cattle meat bone powder. On the contrary, no significant anti -\ntumor effects of racotumomab-alum immunization were observed in \nanimals receiving a standard rodent chow with low NeuGc content. \nThe present data suggest the importance of dietary intake of Neu -\nGc-rich foods in the effectiveness of racotumomab immunotherapy \nusing a humanized mouse model of NSCLC.MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Now, \nwe aim to study the role of HO-1 in thyroid cancer (TC) biology. To \nthat end, we evaluated HO-1 expression by indirect immunofluores -\ncence, cell viability by crystal violet method, cell cycle progression \nby propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry, and cell migration \nby wound healing assay. We found that pharmacological activa -\ntion of HO-1 using 80\u03bcM hemin increased cell viability in TPC-1 \n(p<0.001) and 8505c (p<0.001) cell lines at 72h. In TPC-1, we found \nthat hemin increased cell number in S- (p<0,05) and G2/M (p<0,001) \nphases and diminished cell number in Go/G1 phase (p<0,001) at \n48h. In 8505c, hemin increased cell number in S- (p<0,001) phase \nand diminished cell number in Go/G1 (p<0,01) and G2/M (p<0,001) \nphases at 48h. In Nthy-Ori-3-1, a normal thyroid cell line, we found \nthat 80\u03bcM hemin decreased (p<0.001) cell viability at 72h. Also, we \nfound that 80\u03bcM hemin increased cell migration (p<0.001) in TPC-1 \nand 8505c cell lines. On the contrary, inhibition of HO-1 activity using \n16\u03bcM ZnPP decreased cell viability in TPC-1 (p<0.001) and 8505c \n(p<0.001) cell lines at 72h while no differences were observed in \nNthy-Ori-3-1 cells. In TPC-1, ZnPP diminished cell number in Go/\nG1 phase (p<0,01) and increased cell number in G2/M (p<0,05) at \n48h. However, in 8505c, cell cycle progression remained unaltered \nafter ZnPP treatment. Also, 16\u03bcM ZnPP reduced TPC-1 cell migra -\ntion (p<0.001), but in 8505c ZnPP failed to alter migratory capacity. \nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that HO-1 plays a protumoral \nrole in TC cells by altering cell survival, cell cycle progression and \ncell migration. \n456. (133) ORAL TONGUE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMAS \nCAN BE DIFFERENTIATED BY TWO PATHWAY- SPECIFIC \nSIGNATURES THROUGH GENOMIC DATABASES ANAL -\nYSIS \nDiGaudio A, Ayre M, Belforte JE1, Raimondi AR.\nIFIBYNE, UBA-CONICET. 1-IFIBIO-HOUSSAY, UBA-CONI -\nCET.\nHead and neck (HN) SCC show variations in aetiology, incidence \nrates, clinical progression and prognosis based on the anatomical \nsite affected. Oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) is one \nof the most common malignant tumors of the oral cavity and have \na significantly worse prognosis than other sites. Recently we have \nreported that two stemness factors, KLF4 and SOX2, exhibit op -\nposite expression profiles in oral SCC. We found that KLF4 has a \ndifferential expression pattern within OTSCC that depends on the \nsubsite location of the SCC. Most high-throughput omic studies \nhave consider OTSCC as a homogenous group. Aiming to identify \nputative subtypes of OTSSC based on differential activated signal -\ning pathways we first performed an unsupervised cluster classifi -\ncation using TCGA-HNSC database (Firehose Legacy, 522 cases). \nUsing the MD Anderson NG-CHM we inspected the RNA expression \nvs sample heatmap. 4 statistically different clusters were identified \n(1-4). Cluster 1 (168 cases) represents over 60% of the non-oral \ncases in the dataset. Only 7.7% OTSCC mapped in cluster 1, re -\nmaing ones are distributed on clusters 2, 3 and 4 (30, 70 and 17%). \nNext, OTSCC were grouped by cluster assignment and analyzed independently. Cluster assignment cannot be attributed to patient \nage, tobacco or alcohol consumption or any other clinical features \n(cBioPortal). OTSCC from clusters 2, 3 and 4 significantly differ in \nhistologic grade (Chi-squared test, q-value <0.05). We selected all \nDEG with q-value <0.05. Three independent GO analyses were per -\nformed using Reactome Pathway Finder for DEG overexpressed \nin each cluster. DEG highly expressed on cluster 2 (1756 genes) \nare significantly enriched on keratinization pathway while cluster 3 \n(3752) fit to PD-1 signaling. DEG highly expressed on cluster 4 were \nnot significantly integrated on a GO pathway. In summary, our study \nhas identified 2 putative OTSCC subtypes based on differential acti -\nvation of PD-1 and keratinization signaling pathways. \n457. (134) IMPACT OF HPV-16 E6/E7 SELECTIVE OVEREX -\nPRESSION IN THE ANAL SQUAMOUS EPITHELIA OVER \nTHE ANAL CARCINOGENESIS\nAyre M1, Di Gaudio A1, Fernadez Ugazio G2, Jaroslavsky MJ2, \nCoso OA1, Raimondi A R1. \n1 IFIBYNE (CONICET-UBA), 2 Hospital Pirovano\nAnal SCC is a rare malignancy of the lower gastrointestinal tract. \nHowever, it is one of the most common reported malignancy among \npeople with HIV infection. Moreover, infection with human papillo -\nmavirus (HPV) has been demonstrated to be the primary causative \nagent in the development of SCC of the anogenital tract, including \nother cancers. HPV infection has been reported to be associated \nwith 75% to 90% of anal SCC. The exact pathogenesis of anal SCC \nremains unknown. Previously, we have validated the K14CreERTAM \ndriver mouse line to target the anal mucosa. Aimed to selectively \nexplore the role of HPV-related oncoproteins in anal carcinogene -\nsis, without HPV virus infection, we developed a specific HPV-16 \nE6/E7 genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) by crossing \nthe K14CreERTAM mice with the linker line Rosa26-rtTA-IRES-EG -\nFP-rtTAflox and then with Tet-E6/E7 mice (E6/E7-GEM). In this mod -\nel expression is achieved, in a Cre-dependent manner, only after \ndoxycycline (DOX) administration. Up to 2 months after induction \nof the system E6/E7-GEM (N=8) and their control littermates (N=8) \ndid not present any overt phenotype without significant differences \nin survival. However, histological evaluation revealed an abnormal \nanal epithelium as well as tongue and vaginal mucosa changes. The \nanal epithelium developed hyperplasia with hyperorthokeratosis, \nacanthosis and increased proliferative activity in the basal layers. \nDOX withdrawal reverts the above mentioned proliferative pheno -\ntype. Also, we confirmed the expression of EGFP specifically in the \nanal mucosa targeted by this system upon tamoxifen treatment as \nwell as E6 expression by immunohistochemistry in E6/E7-GEM. In \naddition, the increase in basal proliferation was confirmed through \nlabeling with bromodeoxyuridine. We conclude that this GEMM can \nbe further combined with pathway-specific manipulations to unveil \nthe contribution of different regulatory elements involved in the anal \ncarcinogenesis. \n458.

High fat diet (HFD) and metabolic syndrome (MeS) \nincrease PCa risk and aggressiveness. MiRNAs are small non-cod -\ning RNA molecules that regulate gene expression and can be se -\ncreted by tumor cells into the bloodstream. Our aim was to identify \nmiRNAs-based biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of PCa as -\nsociated with MeS. NSG mice chronically fed with HFD or control \ndiet (CD) were s.c. inoculated with PC3 cell line. After tumor growth, \nmice were sacrificed, plasma and tumors were collected. PC3 xe -\nnograft from HFD-fed mice significantly increased the expression \nof hsa-miR-19b-3p,-320a-5p,-101-3p,-3613-3p,-1207-5p,-5095 and \n-2277-5p compared to CD-fed mice. Using DIANA-miRPath v3 ABSTRACTS217\nand DIANA-TarBase v7 tools we found that these miRNAs modu -\nlate specific metabolic and cancer related pathways and more than \n1,100 validated targets involved in proteoglycans in cancer and \nfatty acid biosynthesis. Furthermore, using bioinformatic tools and \nhuman datasets we demonstrated that these 2 miRNAs were sig -\nnificantly increased in the bloodstream of PCa patients compared \nto non-PCa volunteers, in prostate tumors compared to normal ad -\njacent tissues (NAT) and in tumors of metastatic patients compared \nto tumors of non-metastatic patients. In addition, miR-101-3p was \nincreased in exosomes isolated from blood of PCa patients. Final -\nly, we established that 6 target genes that negatively correlate with \nmiR-19b-3p in prostate tumor samples from patients were involved \nin Proteoglycan in cancer and Focal adhesion pathways and were \ndown-regulated in tumors compared to NAT. No significant changes \nin the expression of miR-101-3p target genes were found in tumor \ncompared with NAT. In summary, we propose miR-19b-3p and miR-\n101-3p as oncomiRs at tumor and metastatic site level, respectively, \nthat can be useful as prognosis and diagnosis biomarkers. \n459.

Instituto de Qu\u00edmi -\nca Biol\u00f3gica de la Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales \n(IQUIBICEN), Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nWithin prostate cancer (PCa) tumors, there is a sub-population of \ncancer stem cells (CSCs) that enhances the tumor\u2019s capacity to pro -\nliferate and metastasize. Thus, stemness represents a therapeutic \nchallenge in PCa. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), the rate-limiting en -\nzyme in heme degradation, is an essential player in cellular respons -\nes to pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory insults. We have reported \nHO-1 strong anti-tumoral effect in vivo  and in vitro , but its associa -\ntion with metastasis-stemness (M-S) is still poorly elucidated. In this \nwork, we aimed at describing the effects of HO-1 overexpression \non M-S processes in PCa. Clonogenic assays were performed to \nevaluate the effect of HO-1 induction on the stem properties of PCa \ncells. Results showed a significant reduction in colony formation \nafter HO-1 pharmacological induction with hemin. RNA-Seq anal -\nysis was performed to assess differential gene expression of 144 \nM-S associated genes in PC3 hemin vs. PC3 control. We found a \nsignificant modulation of 32 markers related to these processes un -\nder HO-1 induction. We assessed the clinical significance of these \ngenes through integrative bioinformatics analyses using public data \nrepositories. The Oncomine database showed that 15/32 signifi -\ncantly HO-1-modulated genes were differentially expressed in pros -\ntate adenocarcinoma vs. normal prostate gland. Hemin treatment \nreverted the expression profile observed in PCa tumors. The TC -\nGA-PRAD dataset revealed that ADAM15, BCL2L1, LTBR, MBNL2 \nand SPINT1 showed the same expression profile as Oncomine. \nMoreover, PCa patients with high MBNL2 expression  showed a sig -\nnificant increase in the disease progression free interval, which is \ninteresting as it is upregulated in PC3 overexpressing HO-1. This \nwas validated by RT-qPCR. This study may cast a new light on PCa \ntreatment, highlighting a multifaceted role for HO-1 in altering these \nprocesses by modulating cell plasticity, thus supporting it as a poten -\ntial therapeutic target for the disease.\n460. (147) CHARACTERIZATION OF THE TUMOR MICROEN -\nVIRONMENT (TME) OF A TRIPLE NEGATIVE MAMMARY \nADENOCARCINOMA, GROWING IN ANIMALS WITH DIF -\nFERENT GENOTYPES\nFusini, Mat\u00edas E.1; Capitani, Mar\u00eda C.1; Del Gi\u00fadice, Antonela \n1,2; Mainetti, Leandro E.1; Scharovsky, O.

The TME plays a critical role in tumor growth, invasion and metas -\ntasis. One of its components are the cancer associated fibroblasts \n(CAF). The type I collagen, secreted by CAF regulates tumor sensi -\ntivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Solid tumors progress in a hypoxic \nenvironment, inducing the hypoxic inducible factor (HIF-1\u03b1) which \nactivates genes related to cell survival, angiogenesis and metasta -\nsis. The CBi- mice line was selected by artificial selection from the \nCBi line. M-406 is a triple negative (ER-,PR-,HER2-) mammary ade -\nnocarcinoma which grew spontaneously in a CBi female mouse and \nit is maintained in vivo  by i.p. injections. It grows and kills 100% of \nCBi mice. On the contrary, in CBi- mice, it grows briefly in all the an -\nimals, and then, the tumor is rejected in 100% of the mice. Our aim \nwas to characterize the M-406 TME when growing in CBi mice and \nin the F1 generation of the parental lines CBi (susceptible) and CBi- \n(resistant). Mice were challenged s/c with M-406, and tumor volume \nevolution and lung metastasis N\u00b0 were determined. At the end of \nthe experiment it was evaluated the CAF presence through the % of \ntumor collagen (Picro-Sirius Red) and \u03b1-SMA+ (marker CAF) (IHQ) \nareas and, also, the N\u00b0 of HIF-1\u03b1+ cells (IHQ). The tumors behaved \nas seen previously, growing exponentially in CBi and F1 mice. While \nCBi mice did not develop metastasis, 36/37 of F1 mice did. The % \nof collagen area was lower (P<0.0001) and of \u03b1-SMA+ area was \nhigher (P<0.01), and the N\u00b0 of HIF-1\u03b1+ cells was lower (P<0.0001) \nin CBi growing tumors compared to those growing in F1 mice. Con -\nclusions: 1) M-406 shows a different TME when grows in genetically \ndifferent hosts; 2) Only F1 mice developed metastasis; 3) F1 mice \ntumors showed more HIF-1\u03b1+ cells and less % of collagen and % of \n\u03b1-SMA+ areas, than CBi mice; 4) In F1 mice, the dynamic interaction \nbetween tumor cells and their environment led to more aggressive \ntumors, shown by the extremely high % of animals developing lung \nmetastasis.\n461.

At present, treatment decisions should be based on the under -\nlying molecular pathways and biological mechanisms. P-Rex1 is a \nRac-GEF essential for Rac1 activation that plays an important role \nin regulating cell migration. It has been reported that P-Rex1 is over -\nexpressed in luminal breast tumors and, when silenced, the migra -\ntion of cancer cells is inhibited. We evaluated the levels of P-Rex1 \nand its association with clinical- histopathological parameters in \nArgentine patients with breast cancer at the Marie Curie Oncology \nHospital. We analyzed the expression of P-Rex1 in biopsy material \nand in tumors and their corresponding healthy adjacent tissues from \npatients not subjected to neoadjuvant therapy. P-REX1 mRNA ex -\npression was analyzed by quantitative PCR (Q- PCR), and protein \nby Western blot (WB) or immunohistochemistry (IHC). These data \nwere validated by an in silico analysis made from public access da -\ntabases (Metabric, GEO repository of NCBI and UCSC Xena).\nP-REX1 mRNA levels were significantly overexpressed (p<0.05) in MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Moreover,  50%  of TNBC  Argentine patients over -\nexpressed P-REX1\nThe P-Rex1 protein in TNBC was also significantly increased (ob -\nserved by WB and IHC), showing specific staining exclusively in tu -\nmor cells. These new findings add relevance to the field of cancer \ntherapies, as the TNBC subpopulation could benefit from P-Rex1 \ninhibition therapy.\nWe found significant correlations (p <0.05) of P-Rex1 with: estrogen \nand progesterone receptors, tumor size, Ki67 proliferation marker, \nage, histological subtype, clinical stage, number of regional lymph \nnodes affected, menopausal status, histological grade, ethnicity, im -\nmunological subtype, and disease recurrence. Overall, our results \ncontribute to establish that PREX1 represent a possible therapeutic \ntarget for TNBC that exhibit PREX1 overexpression.\n462.

These data reinforce the hypothesis that KS may de -\nrive from KSHV-infected MSCs migrating into an inflammatory and \nangiogenic site enhancing the reprograming and transformation \ncapacity of KSHV. Aim:  uncover specific mechanisms and condi -\ntions involved in KSHV-induced transformation and reprograming of \nhMSCs. Methods:  We carried out KSHV infection of hMSCs then \nsubjected to MEM or KS-like pro-angiogenic culture conditions. \nThree days after infection, we performed RNA-sequencing and \npathway analysis of the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) \nbetween these different environmental conditions. Results:  We \nfound that differentially regulated pathways related to Extracellular \nMatrix Organization, Cytokine Activity and Cell Cycle showed twice \nthe amount of DEGs (LogFC>1.5, p<0.001) in KS-like compared to \nMEM conditions. Differential pathways (q < 0.05) like MAPK cas -\ncade, PI3K-Akt and Angiogenesis appear to be activated only in \nhMSCs infected in a KS-like environment with increased expression \nof endothelial markers such as: PECAM1, VEGFR1, ROBO4, XDH \nand ESM1. These correlates with increased expression of KSHV \nlytic genes and highlights the importance of this condition in KSHV \nreprograming of hMSC towards endothelial differentiation and trans -\nformation. Using a KS gene signature and data from 24 KS patients \nand contralateral control skin, we showed that infection of hMSC in \nKS-like conditions reprograms hMSC closer to KS lesions compared \nto infection in MEM conditions, which cluster with normal skin. Con-\nclusion:  This analysis shows that KSHV infection in KS-like condi -\ntions reprograms hMSC closer to KS expression profiles reinforcing \nthe notion of these cells as most likely KS precursors. \n463.

Miami, Florida, USA.\nIntroduction: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common tumor in wom -\nen and a significant cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality \nworldwide. The standard treatment depends on several factors in -\ncluding stage, histology, and molecular markers expression. Che -\nmotherapy (CT) is a widely approach used many times as concom -\nitant neoadjuvant therapy with radio, endocrine or immunotherapy. \nCT is widely used for cancer treatment as a neoadjuvant therapy to \nreduce tumor volume prior to surgery and as a post-surgical adju -\nvant. However, in some cases tumors do not respond to treatment. \nCancer Stem Cells (CSC) are a minority tumor cell population, as -\nsociated to chemoresistance. Thus, the development of an in vitro \nsphere-forming assay that can predict CSC treatment response, \nis an important issue for these patients. Microfluidic devices (MD) \nhave surged in the last decade, as a powerful tool for cell individual \nstudy, with the benefit of using a low amount of biological samples. \nObjective: Evaluate CSC response post-treatment with CT drugs \nlike doxorubicin (Doxo) and paclitaxel (Ptx) using a murine BC \nmixed cell line (LM38-LP) in conventional culture conditions and in \nMicrofluidic approach. Results: Cancer sphere forming assay, was \ncarried out with or without Doxo or Ptx in both culture support. CT \ndecreased the number of CSCs, measured as sphere formation ef -\nficiency (p<0,005), spheres size in 40% (p<0,005) and decreased \nthe remaining survived cells by 65% with Doxo and 35% with Ptx (p \n<0,005). Also, CT induced an increase of pluripotent markers Oct4, \nSox2, Nanog and CD44 determined by qPCR (p<0,0001 vs control) \nand immunofluorescence. Conclusion: Both CT drugs inhibited the \nnumber and survival rate of CSC but increases pluripotent capacity \nin remanent cells. The use of MD provides the additional advantage \nof evaluating small samples with statistic relevance and a transla -\ntional possibility for therapeutic prediction in patients. \n464.

To elucidate the mechanisms that synchro -\nnize these functions, we investigated the role of glycosylation-de -\npendent, galectin-1 (Gal1)-driven circuits in coupling immunoregu -\nlatory and pro-angiogenic activities of MDSCs. Flow cytometry and \nHPLC-HILIC/WAX revealed an activation-dependent glycan profile \nin monocytic and polymorphonuclear MDSCs (p=0.03) that contro -\nlled Gal1 binding and was more prominent in tumor microenviron -\nments. Exposure to Gal1 led to concomitant activation of immuno -\nsuppression and angiogenesis programs in bone marrow derived \nMDSCs. Flow cytometry of Gal1-conditioned MDSCs showed higher \nexpression of immune checkpoint molecules, including programmed \ndeath ligand-1 (PD-L1) (p=0.005) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygena -\nse (IDO) (p=0.037) and greater production of reactive oxygen spe -\ncies (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) (p=0.02) . In vitro, Gal1-conditio -\nned MDSCs showed greater T-cell suppressive capacity (p=0.03) \nand higher IL-10 (p=0.04) and IL-27 (p=0.003) secretion. These \neffects were accompanied by enhanced endothelial cell migration, \ntube formation, 3D-sprouting and vascularization (p<0.05). In vivo , \nGal1-conditioned MDSCs accelerated tumor growth (p=0.001) and \nfostered immune evasion and vascularization programs in Gal1-de -\nficient colorectal tumors. Mechanistically, mass spectrometry, im -\nmunoblot and blocking assays identified the CD18/CD11b/CD177 \ncomplex as a bona fide Gal1 receptor and STAT3 as a key signaling \npathway coupling these functions. Accordingly, a combined algori -\nthm that integrates Gal1 expression and MDSC phenotype, showed \ncritical prognostic value by delineating the immune landscape and \nclinical outcome of human cancers. Thus, glycosylation-dependent \nGal1-driven circuits favor tumor progression by coupling immuno -\nregulatory and pro-angiogenic programs of MDSCs via CD18- and \nSTAT3-dependent pathways.\n465.

However, the effects of Kf on endometrial and cervi -\ncal carcinoma remain unknown. Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is a \nheterodimeric enzyme constituted by two subunits, alpha1 (a1) and \nbeta1. We showed that a1 overexpression increases proliferation, \nmigration and survival in cervical (HeLa) and endometrial (ECC-1) \ncancer cells. High levels of a1 correlate with worse survival in cer -\nvical cancer. Our aim was to study the effects of Kf on ECC-1 and \nHeLa cells overexpressing a1. \na1 was overexpressed by using an adenoviral vector carrying the \ncomplete sequence of a1 (a1-myc) or empty virus as control.

We have previous -\nly described (Buenos Aires Breast Cancer Symposium 2020) that \nsome miRNAs that bind to ADRA2A can predict better disease-free \nsurvival (DFS). The present work aimed to find some miRNAs that \nbind to one or more of the 4 adrenergic receptors expressed in \nbreast cancer and predict 100% DFS in the different breast cancer \nsubtypes (luminal A, LA, luminal B, LB, HER2-enriched H and bas -\nal-like, B). \nWe interrogated in the public TCGA database the expression of ma -\nture miRNAs able to bind to the receptor 3\u00b4UTR. The cutoff points \nfor disease-free survival (DFS) were selected using Evaluate Cut -\npoint. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier and log-\nrank (Mantel-Cox).\nWe first analyzed all the miRNAs that bind ADRA2A, ADRA2B, \nADRA2C and ADRB2, the adrenergic receptors expressed in breast \ncancer. We found more than 40 miRNAs whose high or low expres -\nsion significantly predicted better DFS in some tumor subtypes. \nFrom them, we selected those in which a high or low expression \nwas associated with 100% DFS. Those miRNAs are shown for the \nspecific subtype in which the association was found. The p-value for \nDFS between high and low expression is also shown. The miRNA \nwhose high expression showed 100% DFS were for LA: miR-30e-\n5p, p=0.0175; for LB: let-7b-3p, p=0.0138; let-7d-3p, p=0.0221; let-\n7i-3p, p=0.0322; miR-33a-5p, p=0.0393; miR-30c-5p, p=0.0314 and \nfor H: miR-30d-5p, p=0.0415. The miRNA which a low expression \npredicts 100% survival were for LA: miR-15a-5p, p=0.0298; miR-\n16-1-3p, p=0.0156; miR-23b-5p, p=0.0240; miR-145-5p, p=0.0148; \nmiR-497-3p, p=0.0124; for LB: miR-30c-5p, p=0.0384 and for H: \nmiR-195-5p, p=0.0126. None was found for B tumors.\nThese miRNAs, through the several proteins whose expression they \nregulate, might be selectively used as prognostic biomarkers in the \ndifferent BC subtypes.\n467.

We have previously reported that the \nnon-canonical NF-kB pathway (NCP) plays a key role in human cHL \ncells survival, being NIK stabilization responsible for its constitutive \nsignaling. Also, we have shown that BCL-2 sustained expression is MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021220\npartially a consequence of this mechanism and should be considered \nas a prognosis biomarker. The aim of this work was to explore the \nmechanism underlying the anti-tumor effects of the NCP and BCL-2 \ninhibition after treatment with 4H-isoquinoline-1,3-dione (iNIK) and \nvenetoclax (VTX), respectively, or their combination in human cHL \ncell lines from R/R patients. Trypan blue exclusion and MTS assays \nshowed that treatment with iNIK decreased cell growth in all cell \nlines (p<0.05), but only increased the % of PI+ cells in UH01 and \nL1236 cells (p<0.05) in FDA/PI staining assay by FC. Treatment with \nVTX induced cell death in all three cell lines (p<0.01). Interestingly, \niNIK+VTX treatment increased % of PI+ cells as compared to each \ndrug alone (p <0.05) in all cell lines, inducing cell death at doses that \ndid not do so as single treatments. Searching for signaling pathways \nthat could explain the anti-tumor mechanisms, we re-visited our pre -\nvious expression array data of the inhibition of the NCP in UH01 \ncells (GSE109803) using InnateDB. NCP inhibition was associated \nwith \u201cApoptotic process\u201d (p=0.0006), \u201cB cell proliferation\u201d (p=0.026) \nand \u201cBH3-only proteins associate with anti-apoptotic BCL-2 mem -\nbers signaling pathway\u201d (p=0.006). In view of this, we performed WB \nanalysis for proteins involved in those processes after treatment with \niNIK or VTX. We found that both treatments were able to modulate \nthe expression of Bcl-XL, Bad, LC3, Beclin-1 and p-Akt/Akt. Our re -\nsults led us to conclude that inhibition of the NCP and BCL-2 should \nbe considered as potential targets in R/R cHL treatment.\n468.

FGF/FGFR alterations are frequent \nin breast cancer patients, and for this reason, FGFR inhibitors are \nbeing evaluated to overcome endocrine resistance. In addition, a \npositive loop between FGF2 and RUNX2 has been shown in bone \ntissue. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the interplay between FGFR2 \nand RUNX2 in luminal human breast cancer models in response \nto endocrine or FGFR-targeted therapies. We stably transfected \nMCF7 and T47D cells with a constitutively active FGFR2 (R2CA), \na RUNX2 expression plasmid, or an empty vector (Control). R2CA \nand RUNX2 cells grow in vivo  without hormone supply. R2CA cells \nshow phosphorylated estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors \n(PR) and higher RUNX2 levels as compared with control cells. \nRUNX2 cells express lower levels of estrogen receptor (ER) and \nhigher levels of FGFR2 as compared with control cells. Both, R2CA \nand RUNX2 tumors give rise to lung metastasis, absent in control \nmice. The antiestrogen Fulvestrant (p<0.001), or the antiprogestin \nmifepristone (p<0.05) decreased R2CA tumor growth compared to \ncontrols while RUNX2 tumors were unresponsive, suggesting that \nRUNX2 overexpression bypasses the hormone receptor-associated \npathways. Then, we evaluated if RUNX2 tumors were sensitive to \nthe FGFRs inhibitor PD173074 taking advantage of the higher lev -\nels of FGFR2 expressed by this model. RUNX2 tumors exhibited \nPD173074 resistance showing even a more aggressive phenotype \nthan control tumors. We conclude that FGFR2 and RUNX2 promote \ntumor progression and hormone-independent growth. However, \nRUNX2 seems to be more important for the acquisition of endocrine \nresistance. Our results emphasize a) the evaluation of RUNX2 be -\nfore initiating an FGFR2 directed therapy and b) the possible use of \nRUNX2 inhibitors in combination with standard therapy in selected \nbreast cancer patients.\n469.

In contrast, ceefourin-1 induced apopto -\nsis of AML cells, determined by caspase-3 cleavage and annexin \nV-FITC (p<0.05), and co-stimulation with HIST potentiated this effect \n(p<0.05). Since until today, there are no reports of ceefourin-1 ad -\nministration in vivo, we assessed its potential subacute toxic effects \nin BALB/c mice (ip, 10mg/kg, 3 times/week, 2 weeks). Blood param -\neters, as well as hepatic and renal functions, showed no alterations \nupon treatment with ceefourin-1. We then evaluated the impact of \nceefourin-1 (ip, 10mg/kg daily) and its combination with HIST (sc, \n5mg/kg daily) in U937 xenografts in NGS mice treated for 2 weeks. \nAlthough tumor growth was unaltered, a significant decrease in the \nmitotic index and an increase in the apoptotic index was observed \nin ceefourin-1-treated tumors, with or without HIST, compared to ve -\nhicle or HIST groups. Taken together, our results contribute to the \nrational basis of a polypharmacological approach in AML using HIST \nand MRP4 inhibitors that needs to be studied further.\n470.

To estimate the impact on cancer populations in popular \nneighborhoods, a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional preva -\nlence study was started in that population.\nAn oncological population in a neighborhood called Los Hornos \n(LH), was selected based on socio-sanitary data collected door by \ndoor during 2020. For the impact study, people were relinked by \ntelephone or by a home visit. Type of cancer and its evolution, co -\nmorbidities and their life context in the pandemic were investigated \nthrough individual interviews. Routine biochemical determinations, ABSTRACTS221\ntumor markers and COVID-19 antibodies, were analyzed in blood \nsamples. Also, clinical parameters (blood pressure, blood oxygen \nsaturation, capillary glycemia) were registered.\nIn 65 blocks surveyed in 2020, 364 dwellings (1,274 inhabitants) \nwere surveyed and 53 people declared oncological disease as co -\nmorbidity. It was able to relink and interview 22 of them and 9 were \nalso included in the protocol. During 2020, the 25% of the people \ncould continue monitoring their disease and comorbidities, but the \n66% had to discontinue it. Also, 42% of the people did not need on -\ncological medication during 2020, but from the remaining 58%, 25% \ncould not access the medication. From clinical evaluations, 57% of \npeople had one or more altered parameters, several classified as \nrisk factors for arterial hypertension and diabetes. The COVID-19 \nserology was (+) for 89% of the analyzed people, with a positivi -\nty index (PI) range between 4.97 <PI <18.37. A single person, not \nvaccinated, had no antibodies. We preliminarily identify difficulties \nin adherence to treatment of comorbidities concomitant with onco -\nlogical disease.\nHaving scientific evidence of the health status of vulnerable popula -\ntions allows the generation of community actions aimed at assisting \nand linking the institutions and their community.\n471.

Thus, we \nconducted a pre-surgical window of opportunity trial to test the ef -\nfect of  mifepristone (MFP; 200 mg, PO,  QD, 14 days) in 20 breast \ncancer patients selected by  their  high PRA/PRB isoform ratio (MIP -\nRA; NCT02651844).  The primary endpoint was to compare  the \nKi67 levels of biopsies and the  post-therapy surgical specimens. A \n49.62% decrease in the median was  registered in all surgical speci -\nmens compared to baseline (p=0.0003).  RNA-seq analysis showed \nthat MFP upregulated genes related to the immune system and ma -\ntrix remodeling, and downregulated genes involved in cell-cycle and \nproliferative pathways. Now we report data regarding the PR and es -\ntrogen receptor alpha (ER) regulation by MFP and plasma levels  of \nMFP and 20 steroid hormones (LC-MS/MS). In western blot studies \nan enrichment of the PR isoforms in the nuclear compartment with \nupshifted bands was observed in MFP-treated samples (p = 0.002, \nWilcoxon). Immunohistochemical studies comparing pre- and post- \ntreatment samples suggested a decrease in PR, ER, pSer294PR \nand pSer118ER after treatment. MFP plasma levels were 683.6 +/- \n28.6 nM at day  7, and 757.5 +/- 41.7 nM at day 14 after treatment \ninitiation. An expected increase in cortisol levels (p < 0.001) and \nother steroids was observed in MFP-treated plasma from patients. \nOur results suggest that MFP is playing an active role regulating \ntarget genes in  MFP-treated patients. The decrease in pSer294 PR \nsuggest an inhibition  in MAPK-mediated activation of PR. Since in \na MFP-sensitive mouse  model plasma levels of 20 nM are effective \ninducing tumor regression it may be suggested that lower MFP dos -\nes may exert similar therapeutic effects with less antiglucocorticoid \nside effects.\n472.

This  situation \nmust be considered when choosing a correct cancer treatment.  \nOur aim was to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of  MCT with \nCY+LOS in mice with MetS bearing a mammary  adenocarcinoma, \nand its effect on the tumor micro environment (TME).  CBi female \nmice (5 weeks) were fed with a diet  with 40% calories of fat (HFD) \nthroughout the experiment. At 20 weeks, the development of MetS \nwas confirmed by biochemical and morphological parameters. Once \nthe MetS features were settled, mice were challenged orthotopical -\nly with M-406 tumor (day 0); when the tumor was palpable, mice \nwere distributed into 4 groups, GI: Control, with no treatment; GII: \nCy 25mg/kg/day in the drinking water; GIII: Los 150mg/kg/day  in the \ndrinking water; GIV: Treated as GII + GIII.  Mice were weighted and \ntumor volume measured 3 times/week. When  tumors were expo -\nnentially growing, mice were euthanized, tumors excised and  used \nfor immunohistochemistry (IHC). On day 19, GIV showed tumor  \ngrowth inhibition compared to GI (P<0.01); on day 21 tumor  volume \nwas lower in GIV and GIII vs GI (P<0.01; P<0.05). GIII and GIV \nshowed weight loss since day 11. IHC analysis showed lower N\u00b0 of \nKi67+ cells in GIV vs  GI (P<0.001). The TME showed lower \u03b1SMA+ \ncells and collagen production and less HIF-1\u03b1+ cells in GIV vs GI \n(P<0.01; P<0.05; P<0.05). These results indicate that MCT with \nCY+LOS  inhibit the growth of M-406 in a similar way that in mice  \nfeed with normal diet, as shown previously. GIII  and GIV showed \nweight loss at the end of the  experiment, a sign of toxicity caused \nby LOS. The therapeutic  effect may be achieved, at least in part, by \ndiminishing:  cancer cell proliferation, cancer associated fibroblasts, \ncollagen production and hypoxia.  The efficacy of the therapeutic \nschedule herein utilized indicates the  convenience of its clinical \ntranslation for patients with breast cancer  and MetS.\n473. (307) ROLE OF C-FOS IN AUTOPHAGY REGULATION IN \nGLIOBLASTOMA\nSu\u00e1rez T , Caputto BL, Prucca CG\nDpto. de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica Ranwel Caputto, CIQUIBIC (CO -\nNICET), FCQ-UNC\nc-Fos is a proto-oncoprotein belonging to the AP-1 family of tran -\nscription factors; in addition to its genomic activity, it associates with \ncomponents of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and activates the \nsynthesis of phospholipids and glycolipids by a mechanism inde -\npendent of its transcriptional activity. AP-1 proteins have been in -\nvolved in several pathologies and in developing different types of \ncancer where their activity is often dysregulated, contributing to cell \ntransformation, tumor progression, aggressiveness, and resistance \nto treatment. Autophagy is a process of degradation of cellular com -\nponents and has currently been postulated as a novel therapeutic \ntarget for the treatment of tumors, playing both an anti-tumor and \na pro-tumor role. Our work aims to characterize the participation of \nc-Fos in the regulation of autophagy and its importance in the biolo -\ngy of glioblastomas. We observed high levels of c-Fos expression in \ndifferent tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS), contrasting \nwith an absent or almost undetectable expression in healthy tissues. \nIn addition, the correlation between the degree of malignancy and \nthe level of c-Fos expression highlights the potential of this protein \nas a therapeutic target. We also observed that c-Fos overexpression \npromotes the accumulation of the autophagy marker LC3II in CHO \nK-1 and T98G cells under nutrient-deficient conditions, and results \nof an in silico  analysis reveal that c-Fos has a putative \u201cLIR motif \nsimilar to ATG3\u201d. Viability assays demonstrate that c-Fos overex -\npression does not induce cell death under starving conditions, and MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021222\nthe overexpression of different c-Fos deletion mutants does not in -\nduce an increase in LC3II under nutrient-deficient conditions similar \nto that observed with full-length c-Fos. Preliminary results suggest \nthat the overexpression of c-Fos in T98G cells induces a greater \nnumber of LC3 positive dotted structures than cells that overexpress \na control vector.\n474.

Breast tumor tissue presents an unique and  diverse mi -\ncrobiota. In order to study the prognostic relevance of  the microbi -\nota in the evolution of early breast cancer, a  study was carried out \nincluding biopsies of fresh breast tumor  tissues from women with \ninvasive ductal breast carcinoma, clinicopathological stage  I/II with \na 5-year follow-up minimum ( Hospital Roffo , n=18).  Samples were \nprocessed and DNA was extracted using the QIAamp-DNA-Mini-Kit.  \nThe bacterial profile was identified studying the 16S rRNA gene.  \nOTUs classification and Alpha and Beta diversity analysis were \nperformed  to study the possible associations with the classic pa -\nrameters of  breast cancer and their tumor progression. Taxonomic \nanalysis of these  samples indicated that Proteobacteria (38%) and \nFirmicutes (28%) were the most representative phylum followed by \nBacteroidota (12%) and Actinobacteriota (6%). We found a signifi -\ncant difference between the tumor microbial community of patients \nwho died and those who did not, presenting differences at 16 genus \nlevel, with Prevotella and Anaerococcus being the most abundants \nin patients who died whereas Escherichia-Shigella and Acineto -\nbacter in patients who did not. Twenty eight statistically significant \nmetabolic pathways from Metacyc database were found (Shannon \nindex p=0.02) between patients who died and those who did not, \nhighlighting those associated with polyamine biosynthesis and hexi -\ntol fermentation to ethanol and acetate. To conclude, our preliminary \nfindings and their concordance with previous studies would allow \nthe establishment of a particular taxonomic and functional profile \nassociated with breast cancer patients who died. Finally, the results \nfound between patients who died and did not, open  up new paths in \nthe development of alternative therapies (with probiotics) to improve  \nthe patients\u2019s life-quality.\n475.

Roffo\u201d-UBA\n2 IBYME-CONICET\n*equal contributors\nWe have suggested that GPC3 acts as a metastasis suppressor \nin breast cancer, reversing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition \n(EMT). To further our research, we performed in silico studies using \nthe TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. We determined \nby bioinformatics analysis that normal breast tissues exhibit high \nGPC3 levels while its expression decreases in tumors (p<0.0001, \nANOVA test), mainly in the basal-like subtype (p<0.05, ANOVA test). \nDifferential gene expression studies revealed that \u201chigh GPC3\u201d \nbreast tumors have 1651 upregulated and 299 downregulated ones \n(FDR<0.05, Log2 fold change>0.5). To investigate the biological \nprocesses associated to these modulated genes, we did gene en -\nrichment analysis. Our results showed that in \u201chigh GPC3\u201d patients \ngene signatures involved in the negative regulation of cell-matrix adhesion (FDR<0.05, NES=1.67 and 1.74) and in the activation of \ncell-cell adhesion (FDR<0.05, NES=2) are upregulated. In associ -\nation, in vitro  assays confirmed that GPC3 overexpressing human \nbreast cancer cells (MDA-MB231-GPC3) have low adherence to \nsubstrates like FN and LN (p<0.01, ANOVA test), and express less \nintegrin \u03b21 and \u03b24. We also investigated the EMT process, finding \nan upregulation of a signature involved in its inhibition \u201chigh GPC3\u201d \npatients (FDR<0.05, NES=1.58). Moreover, signatures related to the \ncanonical Wnt signaling (FDR<0.05, NES=-1.64) and to the TGF-\u03b2 \npathway activation (FDR<0.05, NES=-1.51) were downregulated. In \nagreement, MDA-MB231-GPC3 cells exhibited reduced Smad2/3 \nphosphorylation, suggesting a TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibition. Finally, \nassociated with its anti-metastatic function, here we showed that \n\u201chigh GPC3\u201d patients have a longer disease-free survival time and \na lower probability of relapse (p<0.014, Chi2 test, Mantel-Cox Test; \nHR: 0.6140).\nIn sum, these results reinforce the central role of GPC3 in breast \nonco-pathology and propose its potential usefulness as a prognostic \nbiomarker able to predict patient evolution.\n476.

We have previously showed that heme-ox -\nygenase 1 (HO-1), encoded by the gene HMOX1 , has a strong \nanti-tumoral effect in PCa.  We propose that HO-1  and its interac -\ntors reprogram PCa cells, favoring a less aggressive phenotype. In \nthis work, we undertook a mass spectrometry-based proteomics \nanalysis to identify HO-1 molecular partners which might collabo -\nrate with its modulatory function in PCa. PCa cells were transiently \ntransfected with GSTHO-1 or control and treated with the stressor \nagent H2O2. Immunoprecipitated protein complexes were subjected \nto LC-ESI MS/MS. We identified TRIM28, HNRNPA2B1, HSPB1, \nCBX1, CBX3, MATR3, NPM1, DDB1, HMGA1, 14-3-3\u03b6/\u03b4 and \nZC3HAV1, among the HO-1 interactors with nuclear localization. \nWe next performed correlation analysis using open-access PCa \npatient datasets between HMOX1  and the selected candidates, in \norder to assess their clinical significance. Results show a significant \nand positive Spearman correlation between HMOX1  and 6 of those \ngenes, and an increased relapse-free survival in PCa patients with \nhigh expression of those genes. Alternatively, HMOX1  and YWHAZ  \n(14-3-3\u03b6/\u03b4 encoding gene and a strong predictor of PCa aggres -\nsiveness) showed a significant negative correlation. Moreover, PCa \npatients with high expression of YWHAZ , showed a higher risk of \nrelapse. We then validated our proteomics approach by co-immuno -\nprecipitation analysis, ascertaining HO-1 and 14-3-3\u03b6/\u03b4 interaction. \nImmunofluorescence assays provided evidence that HO-1 and 14-\n3-3\u03b6/\u03b4 co-localize in the cell nuclei under oxidative stress conditions. \nIn summary, we describe a novel protein interaction between HO-1 \nand 14-3-3\u03b6/\u03b4 in PCa and highlight the clinical correlation of these \ntwo proteins pointing out to a potential inhibitory role of HO-1 on 14-\n3-3\u03b6/\u03b4, for future therapeutic avenues.\n477. (318) HSP27 AFFECTS CISPLATIN-INDUCED DNA DAM -\nAGE RESPONSE THROUGH ATR/CHK1 PATHWAY IN HU -\nMAN COLON CANCER CELLS\nNiubys Cayado-Guti\u00e9rrez, Anal\u00eda Lourdes Redondo, Antone -\nlla Lossino, Mariel Andrea Fanelli, Laura Mar\u00eda Vargas-Roig, \nSilvina Beatriz Nadin.\nInstituto de Medicina y Biolog\u00eda Experimental de Cuyo, \nCCT-Mendoza-CONICET, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo.\nAbstract : HSP27 (HSPB1) is overexpressed in many tumor cells ABSTRACTS223\nand has been involved with cancer progression and resistance to \ncancer therapy. Accordingly, HSP27 has become an attractive ther -\napeutic target. Previously, we reported that HSP27 interacts with \nDNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins after cisplatin (cPt) treatment. \nHowever, the role of HSP27 in cPt-induced DNA damage response \n(DDR) through ATR/CHK1 pathway in MMR deficient/proficient tu -\nmor cells remains unknown. Here, human colon cancer cell lines \nHCT116+ch2 (MMR deficient, MMR-) and HCT116+ch3 (MMR pro -\nficient, MMR+) were exposed to 10 \u03bcM of cPt for 24 h. Downregu -\nlation of HSP27 was performed using the antisense oligonucleotide \n(OGX427) and ATR/CHK1 inhibition by VE-821 (VE). Cells were col -\nlected at T0, T3, T9 and T24 (0, 3, 9 and 24 h post-cPt or cPt+VE, re -\nspectively). \u03b3H2AX (DNA double-strand breaks marker), HSP27 and \nphosphorylated CHK1 (pCHK1, Ser345) were analyzed by western \nblot and cell viability by CCK8. HSP27 downregulation significantly \nreduced the expression of \u03b3H2AX and pCHK1 after cPt treatment in \nMMR+ cells (P<0.05). Interestingly, ATR/CHK1 pathway inhibition \nsignificantly decreased HSP27 expression after cPt at T0, T3 and \nT9 in both MMR+/- cell lines (P<0.01), but specially in MMR- cells. \nCHK1 inhibition also decreased \u03b3H2AX levels after 9 hours in recov -\ner media in both cell lines and reduced cell viability (particularly in \nMMR- tumor cells at T0, T3 and T9, P<0.01). Nuclear colocalization \nof HSP27 with pCHK1 and CHK1 was demonstrated by confocal \nmicroscopy in cPt-treated MMR-/+ tumor cells. The Pearson cor -\nrelation coefficient (PCC) was >0.6 and Mander\u2019s overlap coefficient \n(MOC) were: MOC1 >0.6 at T3 and >0.8 at T9; and MOC2 >0.7 at \nT3 and T9. Our data indicate that HSP27 is involved in cPt-induced \nDDR through ATR/CHK1 pathway and could be a promising target \nto enhance tumor chemosensitivity. \n478.

One of its components that is frequently al -\ntered in tumors is Hyaluronan (HA) which has been associated with \nthe aggressiveness of cancer. Also, it has been shown that changes \nin TME can lead to changes in the expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 \ngenes, which have been extensively studied in different tumors.\nAim: The aim of this work was to compare mRNA levels of HA \nmetabolism members and BRCA genes, between tumor (TT) and \nnon-tumor adjacent tissue (NAT) in breast and colorectal cancer, \nand test its correlation with clinical biomarkers (ER, PR, HER2, \nKI67) and patient survival. \nMethods: We compared TT and NAT between HA metabolism mem -\nbers and the DNA repair genes by qPCR, and tested their correlation \nwith biomarkers. We investigated relationship between mRNA ex -\npression and patient survival using the Kaplan\u2013Meier Plotter data -\nbase. The STRING analysis was used to evaluate a protein interac -\ntion networks between HA metabolism members and BRCA genes.\nResults: We show alteration in HA metabolism in colorectal but not \nbreast cancer. We found a decrease in HYAL1 levels in breast but \nnot colorectal cancer. We also show lower HA levels in TT compared \nwith NAT. In both breast and colorectal cancer, CD44 and BRCA2 \nshowed a strong positive correlation. Kaplan\u2013Meier Plotter data \nshowed that the mRNA expression levels of BRCA1 and 2 are high -\ner in cancer than normal tissue and are significantly associated with \nthe relapse-free survival (RFS). HYAL1 levels in breast cancer are higher in normal tissue but don\u2019t influence survival. STRING anal -\nysis showed two clusters: HA metabolism (HAS2, HAS3, HYAL1, \nHYAL2, CD44) and DNA repair and regulation (BRCA1, BRCA2, \nTP53, EP300) with CD44 as a link between these processes.\nConclusion: There is an association between HA metabolism and \nthe DNA repair genes which gives us a new insight in the molecular \nmechanisms of the development and the progression of cancer.\n479.

Here we studied the \nresponse of eight human malignant melanoma cell lines treated at \ndifferent levels of key metabolic pathways to address their vulnera -\nbility and to interpretate their response in terms of the metabolic and \ngenetic background of each cell line. We found that melanoma cells \nexhibited a broad spectrum of sensitivities to bioenergetic modula -\ntors. Based on a previous published work, we defined a concentra -\ntion for each modulator to segregate melanoma cells as sensitive \n(considered as some dependency on this pathway) or non-sensitive. \nAfter that, we found that the order of response to metabolic mod -\nulators was BRAFV600R\u2265BRAFV600E>NRASQ61K. In addition, \nwe found a significant positive correlation between the response to \nDCA (Pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibitor) vs RAD001 (mTORC1 in -\nhibitor) (r=0.87; p<0.0048), DCA  vs oxamate (LDH inhibitor) (r=0.73; \np<0.038) and DCA vs Metrotrexate (MTX, r=0.77; p<0.026). Our re -\nsults suggest that sensitivity to DCA, mTORC1 inhibitor, MTX and \nOxamate is related to the optimization of glucose oxidation by mito -\nchondria. This could be an effective strategy for some specific group \nof melanomas, probably excluding the NRAS mutated subtype. \nHowever, additional experiments are required to validate and better \nunderstand these results.\n480.

The inhibition of PPP key enzymes, including \nglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), strongly affects can -\ncer cell proliferation in vitro, as well as in vivo. We have previous -\nly shown that monolayers of glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines result \nsensitive to PPP inhibition by 6AN. In addition, the combination of \n6AN with metformin (MET, an oral drug for the treatment of T2MD) \nincreases the effectiveness of both monotherapies. Here we inves -\ntigated the impact of 6AN (10 or 25 \u00b5M) alone or in combination \nwith MET (5 mM) on i) clonogenic cells and spheroids (3D) of two \nGBM cell lines (U251 and U373), ii) the AMPK/mTOR/S6 axis (by \nimmunostaining of pACC (an AMPK substrate) and pS6 (a mTOR \npathway effector)) and iii) the presence of senescent cell (by the \nsenescent associated \u03b2-galactosidase enzyme activity).

Media supplementation with 5 mM nicotinamide (NAM, \na precursor of NADPH) or 100 \u00b5M NADPH was able to counteract \nalmost completely (NAM) and partially (NADPH) the effects of 6AN \non clonogenic cells. After 24 h of treatments, we found a decrease \nin pS6 (decreased mTOR signaling) and an increase in pACC im -\nmunostaining (increased AMPK activity) compared to control cells \nwith both monotherapies and combinatory approach. Finally, 7 days \nof treatment with 10 \u00b5M 6AN promoted the presence of \u03b2-galacto -\nsidase positive giant cells probably related with a senescent pro -\ncess. The presence of these cells was prevented by 5 mM NAM. In \nconclusion, our results indicate that the combination of MET/6AN \ndecreases the mTOR pathway signaling affecting 3D cultures and \nclonogenic efficiency of glioblastoma cells. \n481.

Aberrant Rac1 signaling is \nassociated with progression in several tumor types, including breast \ncancer. Previously, our team developed the antitumor compound \n1A-116, a small molecule Rac1 inhibitor, using a rational design ap -\nproach. We have shown that 1A-116 is able to interact with Trp56, a \nkey residue involved in Rac1 activation by different guanine nucle -\notide exchange factors. Such interaction abrogates Rac1 signaling, \nthus generating antitumor effects in vitro  and in vivo . These pre -\nvious evidences supported further preclinical development of 1A-\n116. The aim of this work was to evaluate oral, subcutaneous (SC), \nintravenous (IV) and intraperitoneal (IP) administration routes of an \naqueous formulation of 1A-116. We first analyzed drug effects in \nBalb/c mice implanted in the subcutis with F3II tumors (2 x 105 cells/\nmouse), an aggressive hormone-independent mammary carcinoma \nmodel. Daily IP treatment with 10 mg/kg 1A-116 significantly re -\nduced in vivo  tumor growth and similar results were observed when \nmice were treated once a week with 1 mg/kg IV. We also evaluated \ndrug effects on experimental lung colonization by F3II cells injected \nvia tail vein (105 cells/mouse). IP administration showed a significant \nreduction in the number of metastatic lung nodules, but oral and \nSC 1A-116 administration had no effect. The pharmacokinetic study \nshowed that 1A-116 has a good distribution after IP or IV adminis -\ntration (peak plasma concentrations 0.7-1.4 \u03bcg/ml), and poor oral \nbioavailability with this aqueous formulation. Importantly, 1A-116 \nshowed a favorable acute toxicology profile in mice, with maximum \ntolerated doses of 80 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg for IP and IV routes, re -\nspectively. Our preclinical experiments highlight 1A-116 compound \nas a promising candidate for the treatment of aggressive tumors with \naberrant Rac1 signaling.\n482.

However, a con -\nsiderable proportion of patients remain unresponsive to these ther -\napies. Hence, the development of novel clinical immunotherapeutic \napproaches and/or targets are crucial. In this context, targeting the \nimmune-checkpoint HLA-G/ILT2/ILT4 has caused great interest \nsince it is abnormally expressed in several tumor malignancies \ngenerating a tolerogenic microenvironment. Here, CRISPR/Cas9 \ngene editing system was used to block the HLA-G expression in a \nchoriocarcinoma cell line named JEG-3, which expresses high lev -\nels of this protein. For this purpose, four different single guide-RNA \ntargeting HLA-G exon 1 and 2 were designed (named 1A-, 1B-, 2A- \nand 2B-sgRNA). Then, these sgRNAs were cloned into pSpCas9(B -\nB)-2A-puro(PX459)  vector and were transfected in JEG-3 cells, \neach one separately or all four plasmids simultaneously. The HLA-G \nexpression was measured in the edited JEG-3 cells by western blot -\nting, flow cytometry and RT-qPCR. Genomic DNA was evaluated by \nSanger sequencing to analyse possible modifications. The results \nshowed that HLA-G gene editing was achieved. Downregulation of \nHLA-G was reached to different degrees when JEG-3 cells were \nedited with each one sgRNA separately. Whereas, complete HLA-G \nsilencing was achieved when JEG-3 cells were edited with all sgR -\nNAs simultaneously. Most importantly, the NK degranulation assay \nshowed that edited JEG-3 cells (HLA-G negatives) triggered a high -\ner in vitro  response of NK cells with respect to wild type JEG-3 cells \n(HLA-G positives). Altogether, we demonstrated for the first time the \nHLA-G downregulation through gene editing, with a concomitant ef -\nfect in immune cell activation. This approach would reactivate the \nhost immune system and help to eliminate tumor cells, thus propos -\ning novel cancer immunotherapy. \n483. (348) TISSUE SENESCENCE AND CANCER IN A MURINE \nMODEL OF LIVER CARCINOGENESIS\nDaniela Montagna, Alejandra Duarte, Paula Chiarella, Oscar \nBustuoabad, Ra\u00fal Ruggiero\nIMEX-CONICET, Academia Nacional de Medicina\nPrevious works have described the role of tissular damage and phe -\nnotype associated with tissue senescence as elements that favor \ndevelopment of tumors. However, to date, it is unknown whether \nsenescence, in the context of tissue injury, is a necessary condi -\ntion for carcinogenesis. Herein, we determine whether livers of mice \nthat have received the carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN) show, \nprior to the emergence of the tumor, symptoms of damage and a \ndecreased regenerative capacity. Then we have studied if tumors \nare located preferentially in senescent areas. DEN (5 \u03bcg/gram, in -\ntraperitoneal route) was inoculated into 15-days old C3H male mice \nand, in these conditions, produced liver tumors in about 100% of \nanimals. First tumor foci appeared about 90 days after DEN. Over \ntime their number and size increased progressively and by six \nmonths, displayed the characteristics of trabecular carcinoma. We \nhave observed as functional signs of liver damage an increase in \nalanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alka -\nline phosphatase enzymes post-inoculation of the carcinogen over \ntime (p<0.001 vs inoculation day), which correspond to histological \nchanges compatible with chronic liver inflammation. On the other \nhand, we observed that tumors were placed into or very close to se -ABSTRACTS225\nnescent areas. Senescence was detected by both a reduction of re -\ngenerative ability after partial hepatectomy (day 36: p<0.01; day 78: \np<0.05 and day 180: p<0.001 after DEN inoculation vs control mice) \nand a higher expression of beta-galactosidase in DEN-treated mice \n(p<0.001), an enzyme expressed specifically in senescent cells. \nThese changes preceded in about 40-50 days the first appearance \nof tumors and thereafter they increased progressively. Results sug -\ngest that tumor cells strongly depending on the microenvironment in \nwhich they are placed raising the possibility that manipulation of a \nsenescent microenvironment may be useful to prevent, manage and \neven reverse neoplastic growth.\n484. (354) THYROID HORMONES REGULATE CELL PROLIF -\nERATION AND ANTITUMOR IMMUNITY IN MELANOMA\nHelena Andrea Sterle, Mar\u00eda Florencia Cayrol, Mar\u00eda Merce -\ndes Debernardi, Gonzalo Gonzalez, Graciela Alicia Cremas -\nchi\nInstituto de Investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas (BIOMED) \u2013 UCA - \nCONICET\nMelanoma (ME) is the most severe type of skin cancer and despite \nimmune checkpoint inhibitors provide exceptionally durable re -\nsponses, only a limited number of patients benefit from it, making \ncrucial the study of new compounds for ME treatment. Thyroid hor -\nmones (TH) influence tumor progression by direct actions on cancer \ncells, tumor microenvironment and antitumor immunity. Our first aim \nwas to evaluate TH effect on the proliferation of human (A375 and \nWM35) and mouse (B16F10 and B16F1) ME cells. We found that \nphysiological levels of TH induce 15 to 35% ME cell proliferation \n(p<0.05 vs control). Moreover, cilengitide, a selective inhibitor of the \nTH membrane receptor (mTR) \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin, not only prevents the \nproliferative effect of TH, but also inhibits the basal viability of ME \ncells (*p<0.05 vs vehicle * p<0.05 vs TH). Additionally, the expres -\nsion of both integrins was found to be present on ME patient\u2019s sam -\nples from the TCGA-SKCM project, indicating that the mTR could \nbe a possible target to improve ME therapy. We next evaluated the \neffect of thyroid status on ME cells growing in vivo  in a syngeneic \nmouse model. For this, C57Bl/6 mice were subcutaneously inocu -\nlated with B16F1 cells after the treatment with thyroxine (12mg/l, \n30 days) or propylthiouracil (500mg/l, 15 days) in the drinking water \nto obtain hyperthyroid (hyper) and hypothyroid (hypo) mice. Hyper \nmice showed increased tumor growth rate compared to controls and \nhypo mice (p<0.05). To further analyze the effect of thyroid status \non the anti-ME immune response we evaluated the distribution of \nimmune subsets in secondary lymphoid organs from tumor-bearing \nmice. We observed an increased percentage of NK cells (p<0.05) \nand increased cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity (p<0.05) but also in -\ncreased proportion of MDSC (p<0.05) in spleens from hyper mice. \nOur results suggest that TH positively regulate ME cell proliferation \nthrough \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin and are also involved in the systemic anti-ME \nimmune response. \n485.

In the tumor microenvironment (TME) cancer \nstem cells (CSC), which express CD133, CD44 and CD47 among \nother markers form residual cell niches involved in the recurrence af -\nter treatment. Hyaluronan (HA), a component of the TME, regulates, \nat least in part, the function of CSCs.  We previously demonstrat -\ned that tissue sections from murine Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) \ntumors present high levels of HA and it is higher on isolated LLC CSCs (CD133+) compared with the non-CSCs population (CD133-; \nby FACS). Our analysis of TCGA data from patients with NSLCS \nshowed that HA Synthase (HAS) 3 expression strongly correlates \nwith levels of transcription factors involved in CSC phenotype. We \nmodulated HA with the coumarin 4Mu, detecting an increase in the \nsensibility of LLC cells to paclitaxel (Pa). We aimed to cross-validate \nthe TCGA findings on whole LLC and isolated CD133+ cells after \nexposure to Pa or cisplatin (Cis), alone or in combination with 4Mu. \nWe analyzed the expression of HAS and CSCs genes by qPCR. \nThe expression of HA and their clonogenic and tumor-forming ca -\npability was also evaluated. Pa increases mRNA levels of HAS3 \n(p<0.05) and HAS2 (p<0.01) while LLC treated with Pa+ 0.25 mM \n4Mu showed reduced HAS3 levels(p<0.05). 4Mu also reduced HA \nlevels produced by LLC. CD47 and SOX2 gene expression were \nenhanced by Pa while they decreased with Pa+4Mu (p<0.05). About \n8.53 \u00b1 0.35% of LLC are CD133+, and express more HA compared \nto CD133- (p <0.05). Viability of CD133+ cells decreased when \ntreated with 4Mu+ Qx (Pa: p<0.01, Cis: p<0.05). Remarkably, 4Mu \nreduced the clonogenic (p<0.05) as well as tumor-forming ability of \nLLC CD133+ treated with Pa and Cis (p<0.05). We suggest that \n4Mu improves the efficacy of Qx to inhibit tumor progression and \ncould be implicated in preventing tumor recurrence.\n486.

Here we investigated the role of Gal1 in breast cancer me -\ntastasis. We found at single cell level (scRNAseq) that Gal1 is syn -\nthesized by basal cell lineages and mammary stem cells (SCs) in \nnormal mammary gland, where it promotes epithelial branching (**). \nMoreover, in the MMTV-NeuHER2/transgenic model, Gal1 was in -\nduced in early lesions (EL) compared to primary tumors (PT) (RNA -\nseq). Addition of rGal1 to EL 3D-cultures promoted invasiveness (**) \nand increased epithelial-to- mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers \n(RT-PCR). This effect was confirmed in the aggressive Her2+ hu -\nman cell line JIMT-1, which showed high levels of Gal1 (**, Western) \nand low levels of \u03b12,6 sialyltransferase-1 (ST6Gal1), an enzyme \nthat incorporates \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid and blocks Gal1 binding (***, \nRT-PCR), compared with the HER2+ poorly metastatic cell line BT-\n474. Accordingly, UPLC-HILIC/WAX revealed a Gal1-permissive \nglycan signature in  JIMT1 (***). Treatment of JIMT-1 cells with rGal1, \ninduced a  CD44hi/CD24low cancer stem cell phenotype (***, flow \ncytometry) and enhanced migration (*), mamosphere formation (**) \nand EMT markers (RT-PCR). In vivo , treatment of HER2+PDX with \nrGal1 revealed increased  lung metastasis (*). Bioinformatics analy -\nsis (TCGA) showed that tumors displaying  a Gal- 1hi/ST6GAL1low \nphenotype had the poorest prognosis. Remarkably, these tumors \nupregulated transcripts associated with EMT and downregulated \nthose linked to antitumor immunity (GSEA), as validated by the im-\nmunosuppressive infiltrate (Mixture). Our findings highlight the rele -MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

We  propose that  the Gal1/ST6Gal1 pair might serve \nas a possible biomarker capable of predicting the outcome of breast \ncancer patients and as a therapeutic target of novel anti-metastatic \ntherapies (p<0.05*;p<0.01**;p<0.001***).\n487. (373) EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES IN BREAST CANCER \nMICROENVIRONMENT: THE MECHANISMS UNDERLY -\nING ENDOCRINE RESISTANCE\nRodriguez-Baili MC, Gil GA\nCIQUIBIC-CONICET. Quimica Biologica Ranwel Caputto, \nFCQ.UNC. CP:5000\nAntiestrogen adjuvant treatments are first-line therapies in patients \nwith estrogen receptor-positive (ER +) breast cancer. The treatment \nstrategies need to be improved because most patients eventually \nbecome endocrine resistant and many others are initially refracto -\nry to anti-estrogen treatments. The tumor microenvironment, and \nmainly macrophages, play an essential role in the development and \nprogress of cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying \nthese effects remain poorly understood. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) \nsecreted by tumor cells or by cells from the microenvironment have \nbeen proposed as one of the main forms of cell-cell communication. \nMany reports involve them in processes that are essential for cancer \nprogression such as proliferation, migration, endocrine resistance, \ninvasion, administration of drugs, among others. We proposed that \nEV are one of the most important actors in cell communication and \ncould be one of the responsible for the endocrine resistance that \nwe had observed in our previous work. The first steps for the study \nof these vesicles are the isolation and characterization of EVs from \nour cells of interest, then we evaluate the effect of EVs from mac -\nrophages and activated macrophages on mammary cells (tumor \nand non-tumor). These results suggest that EVs are involved in in -\ncreased proliferation of mammary cells, and this increase depends \non the amount and type of EVs, as well as the recipient cells. This \nand other analyzes will allow us to determine whether EVs are in -\nvolved in communication between tumor-associated macrophages \n(TAMs) and tumor cells, and whether they are responsible for endo -\ncrine resistance in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers.\n488.

While alpha-synuclein (aS) was recently con -\nnected to melanoma development, gamma-synuclein (gS) was \nassociated with a range of tumor types. Our goal was to explore \nthe role aS and gS in melanoma. For that, we worked with mouse \n(B16F0, B16F10) and human (SKMEL28, A375) melanoma cells. \nBy Western Blot (WB) and immunocytochemistry (ICC), we ob -\nserved that both proteins were expressed in these cells. Then, we \nmodulated (by shRNA and expression vectors) aS and gS levels \n(P<0.01 for both proteins by qPCR and WB). Growth studies (cells \ncount and MTT) indicated that reduced expression of aS and gS \nleads to proliferative defects (P<0.05; P<0.01, respectively), while \nincreased expression was associated with cytoskeletal changes, \nmigration and focal adhesions (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively), \nobserved by ICC. Interestingly, melanoma cells were able to uptake \ndifferent exogenous aggregation species of aS. These species, al -\nthough toxic for neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y, P<0.01), failed to trigger \ntoxic effects on melanoma cells, promoting instead proliferation \n(P<0.05), clonogenic capacity (P<0.05), cytoskeletal rearrangement and migration (P<0.01). We confirmed these observations in vivo  \nby two approaches injecting subcutaneously B16-F10 cells (con -\ntrol and incubated with aS fibers) in the right flank in 8-week-old \nfemale C57BL/6 mice (7x104 cells; n=5/group and 2x105 cells; n=6/\ngroup). By the first method, we observed that animals injected with \ntreated cells developed tumors within 4 weeks post-inoculation (no \ntumor was observed in control group at this time). By the second, we \nanalysed melanoma growth measuring tumor volume periodically. \nGrowth kinetics indicated that \u03b1S treatment significantly promoted \ntumor growth (P<0.05).\nAltogether, our results indicate that aS and gS have a role in melano -\nma growth and development. Further studies should be addressed \nto confirm and complement our observations.\n489.

In previous works we explored the role of Vav2 in events \nassociated to melanoma development. We modulated Vav2 expres -\nsion in the mouse-derived melanoma cell line B16-F0 observing that \nVav2 is involved in cellular processes linked to proliferation, migra -\ntion and cytoskeletal rearrangement, promoting melanoma devel -\nopment.\nIn this work, we studied the dependency of these phenotypes on \nRac1 introducing by lipotransfection a fast cycling form of Rac1 \n(Rac1F28L) in Vav2-deficient cells. By MTT based methods we ob -\nserved that defective proliferation and migration associated to re -\nduced levels of Vav2 (P<0.01) were rescued by Rac1 expression. \nWhen cells were subcutaneously injected on C57BL/6 animals \n(n=4), we observed that Rac1 restored the defective tumor growth \nassociated to a decreased in Vav2 (P<0.05). Indeed, defective ex -\npression of the epithelial markers beta-catenin observed by Western \nBlot, was increased by Rac1 (P<0.05) to similar levels observed in \ncatalytically active Vav2 expressing cells.\nAs enhanced nuclear plasticity can promote cell migration during \ninvasive processes, we evaluated the impact of Vav2 modulation \non nuclear shape by DAPI staining, noting that decreased levels of \nVav2 in melanoma cells was associated to an increased percentage \nof rounded nuclei and a lower amount of elongated ones (P<0.01).\nFinally, to analyze the impact of Vav2 on melanoma cytokines \nproduction, we quantify by RT-PCR IL-6 expression, noting that \nVav2-deficient cells expressed reduced levels of IL6 (P<0.05). De -\npendency of these two last phenotypes on Vav2 GEF activity needs \nto be addressed.\nAltogether, our data indicate that Vav2 could participate in different \ncellular processes in melanoma cells through Rac1 activity, promot -\ning tumor development.\n490. (388) CHARACTERIZATION OF A LUMINAL B AND A \nHER2 BREAST CANCER PATIENT-DERIVED XENO -\nGRAFT\nGabriela Pataccini1, Marcela Coianis1, Ramiro Perrotta1, Sil-\nvia I.

Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) are generated by \nimplanting tumor fragments directly from patients into immune-de -\nficient mice. This model reflects more accurately the human tumor ABSTRACTS227\nbiology as compared with cell line xenografts and have potential \napplications in precision medical treatments. We have recently es -\ntablished and genetically characterized 9 PDX (2 luminal, 1 HER2+, \nand 6 TN) derived from BC patients from Hospital Magdalena V. de \nMart\u00ednez . The aim of this study was to characterize one of the lumi -\nnal PDX (707) and the HER2+ PDX (474) in terms of biomarker ex -\npression and treatment response to be used as models of these BC \nsubtypes. PDX707 and the parental tumor are both ER+/PR-/HER2-, \nwhile PDX474 and its parental tumor are ER-/PR-/HER2+. Andro -\ngen receptor (AR) expression was also evaluated being both PDXs \nAR+. PDX707 was treated with tamoxifen (TAM; 5 mg/kg/5 days a \nweek, sc) or testosterone (TESTO; 20 mg pellet , sc) and PDX474 \nwith trastuzumab (TZ) and TZ emtansine (TDM1; 15 mg/kg/3 days \na week, sc). Treatments started when tumors were 25 mm2. TAM \nand TESTO inhibited PDX707 tumor growth (p<0.001) and, TZ and \nTDM1, inhibited PDX 474 tumor growth (p<0.001), being the effect \nof the latter more effective than the former. In conclusion, we have \ndeveloped and characterized one luminal PDX suitable to explore \nthe effect of combined endocrine therapies, and one HER2+ breast \ncancer model sensitive to HER2 inhibitors that may be used to test \nnovel HER2 ligands or combined therapies for personalized medi -\ncine. Our results also highlight the role of AR ligands in ER+PR- tu -\nmors which have earlier recurrence than ER+PR+ tumors.\n491.

When injected \ninto immunodeficient mice, these highly tumorigenic cells can de -\nvelop and propagate brain tumors. GSCs are characterized by their \nself-renewal potential and their differentiation capacity. The use of \nmultiple patient-derived GSCs constitutes a valuable tool to under -\nstand the biology of gliomas in greater detail and to develop trans -\nlational projects that might contribute to personalized therapies. In \nthe past years, many studies have demonstrated that galectins, a \nfamily of highly conserved glycan-binding proteins, play key roles in \ndifferent aspects of cancer biology, including cellular transformation, \nproliferation, and apoptosis. In addition, these lectins contribute to \ntumor progression by favoring angiogenesis, tumor invasion and im -\nmune escape. In this study, we found that patient-derived GSC lines \nexhibit high expression of galectins-1 and -3 and an intermediate \nexpression of galectins-2, -8, and -9. Importantly, by siRNA-mediat -\ned gene silencing, we found that galectins-1 and -3 participate in the \ncontrol of different processes associated with GSCs. By Ki-67 im -\nmunostaining, we determined that decreased levels of these galec -\ntins lead to a reduction in GSC proliferation from 38,8% to 51,6% \n(p<0.05, n=3). Also, propidium iodide staining revealed that down -\nregulation of galectin-1 exacerbates cell death in a cell line-specific \nmanner from 76,7% to 126,6% (p <0.05, n=3), and this effect occurs \nonly when galectin-3 expression is unaltered. Finally, as shown by \ncell spreading migration assays, silencing of these galectins also im -\npairs GSC migration from 17% to 48% (p <0.05, n=3). Thus, involve -\nment of these lectins in multiple processes associated with GSCs \nsuggests their role as potential targets of therapeutic strategies in \nhigh-grade gliomas.\n492. (412) CHARACTERIZING A TUMOR SUPPRESSOR ROLE \nFOR Vav3 IN MELANOMA \nNahuel Cesatti Laluce1,2; Macarena Mamberto1,2; Florencia Malizia1; Mauricio Menacho M\u00e1rquez1,2,3\nInstituto de Inmunolog\u00eda Cl\u00ednica y Experimental de Rosario \n(IDICER, UNR-CONICET); 2CONICET; 3CIPReB (FCM-UNR)\nUniversidad Nacional de Rosario\ncesattilaluce@idicer-conicet.gob.ar\nMelanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer, with globally in -\ncreasing prevalence and mortality. A better understanding of this pa -\nthology at molecular level is a key challenge to improve diagnostic \nand therapy.\nVav proteins are Rho GTPases guanosine nucleotide exchange fac -\ntors (GEFs). They modulate processes associated to tumor deve -\nlopment and metastasis. As GEFS, these proteins were classically \nconsidered as protumoral. \nWe previously characterized the role of Vav2 in melanoma. Now we \ndescribe that Vav3 and Vav2 display antagonistic roles in this tumor \ntype, contrary to what is described in other cancer types (including \nnon-melanoma skin cancers). Through bioinformatic approaches we \nfound that Vav3 expression varies significantly between healthy skin \nand melanoma (P\u22640.01) while this GEF acts like a double agent in \nother tumor types. \nWe modulated Vav3 expression in B16-F0 cells. By MTT assays \nwe observed that Vav3 expression affects proliferation (P\u22640.001). \nWe also found Vav3 levels affect both cell morphology and migra -\ntion capacity; decreased Vav3 promotes a star shape associated \nto greater migratory capacity by wound healing assays (P\u22640.001), \nwhile increased expression induces elongated shape and poor mi -\ngration (P\u22640.001). Indeed, increased expression of Vav3 promotes \napoptosis by starvation.\nBy in vivo  assays with 8-weeks old C57BL/6 female mice (n=6/\ngroup) subcutaneously injected, we demonstrated that Vav3 down -\nmodulation increases tumor growth while high Vav3 levels drastica -\nlly impairs tumor kinetics.\nAltogether our data suggest a new tumor suppressor role for Vav3 \nin melanoma.  \n493.

The 5-year \nsurvival rate of patients is 9%, and this is largely due to the great \nmetastatic potential of this type of tumor.\nDifferent studies have shown that ectopic expression of specific \ntranscription factors can successfully transdifferentiate pancreatic \ntumor cells from the exocrine to the endocrine lineage. Our aim was \nto analyze the effect of the exocrine-endocrine transdifferentiation of \nPDAC in relation to their migratory phenotype, and to develop an in \nvivo model for pancreatic cancer studies.\nWe compared the gene expression profiles of ductal and endocrine \npancreatic cells through the analysis of single cell RNA-seq. We \nidentified 371 genes that are expressed at least twice as much in \nductal as in endocrine pancreatic cells and performed a functional \nanalysis of ontologies and signaling pathways (GO and KEGG). 54 \ngenes were identified by both strategies as potentially related to tu -\nmor aggressiveness through characteristics such as cell migration \nand cell adhesion.\nAdditionally, PANC-1 and SW1990 cells were implanted on the cho -\nrioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chick embryos, and tumor growth \nwas analyzed at different stages. We found significant tumor growth \n10 days after implantation.\nIn order to induce transdifferentiation, PANC-1 cells were treated \nwith BRD7552 for either 4 or 9 days, and migration rates were ana -\nlyzed by wound healing assays. Significant decreases in migration MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021228\nrates were observed, whereas MTT assays showed no significant \ndifferences.\nIn this work we identified genes involved in transdifferentiated cell \nphenotype, we revealed the inhibited migratory potential of trans -\ndifferentiated cells, and we established an alternative in vivo  model \nfor the study of PDAC based on cell implantation on the CAM of the \nchick embryo, well-suited for the in vivo  evaluation of the effects of \ndrugs on tumor growth, invasiveness, and metastatic potential.\n494. (425) PIN1 DELETION DOWNREGULATES TELOMERE \nMAINTENANCE AND REDUCES ONCOGENIC FEATURES \nIN GLIOBLASTOMA CELLS \nJuli\u00e1n Maggio1, Georgina A. Cardama2, Romina G. Arman -\ndo1, Daniel E.

Mengual G\u00f3mez1.\n1 Molecular Oncology Unit - Molecular and Translational On -\ncology Center - Department of Science and Technology - Na -\ntional University of Quilmes.\n2 Biotechnology Services Platform - Molecular and Transla -\ntional Oncology Center - Department of Science and Techno -\nlogy - National University of Quilmes.\nPIN1 is the only isomerase capable to isomerize the phosphory -\nlated Serine/Threonine-Proline motif and regulate diverse cellular \nfunctions. Thus, both PIN1 overexpression and its involvement in \nvarious oncogenic pathways has been reported in several cancer \ntypes, including glioblastoma. This is a lethal disease with limited \ntherapeutic resources so far. Due to the need to develop new thera -\npies, there is an interest in exploring PIN1 role in glioblastoma. For \nthese reasons, in a previous study, our group developed a PIN1 \nknock-out  glioblastoma cell model using LN229 cells. Results re -\nvealed that PIN1 deletion suppressed their malignant phenotype by \nreducing migration, cell cycle progression, and increasing doubling \ntime. The current work focuses on deciphering the molecular mech -\nanisms underlying the less aggressive phenotype of PIN knock-out \nglioma cells. First, the effect of PIN1 deletion on NF-\u03baB pathway ac -\ntivation was studied using an NF-\u03baB-LUC system. Additionally, IL-8 \nand telomerase catalytic subunit (htert) transcription levels, were \nquantified by qPCR. We also carried out a telomerase activity assay \nby RQ-TRAP; determination of relative telomere length by qPCR; \nsenescence study by b-Galactosidase staining and apoptosis acti -\nvation by measuring caspase-3 activity, in both LN PIN1 knock-out \nand LN229 cells.\nResults showed that PIN1 deletion decreased NF-\u03baB activity and \nboth IL-8 and htert expression, a decrease of 55,40% in telomer -\nase activity (p<0,0001) and a consequent telomere shortening of \n45,14% (p<0,0001). Telomere shortening in LN PIN1 knock-out  gen-\nerated an increase in senescent cells and apoptotic cells, raising a \nvalue of 51,48% (p< 0,001) and 55.60% (p< 0,05) in comparison to \nLN229 cells, respectively.\n These results highlight PIN1 implication in tumor progression and \ntelomere maintenance in glioblastoma, suggesting this mechanism \nas a new potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of this \ndisease.\n495. (426) SYNERGISTIC APOPTOTIC EFFECT OF 2\u00b4NITRO -\nFLAVONE COMBINED WITH SAFINGOL IN MURINE \nMAMMARY TUMOR CELLS\nJuan Manuel Anselmi Relats, Leonor Roguin, Mariel Marder, \nJulieta Marino, Viviana Blank \nIn a previous work, we have demonstrated that the synthetic flavo -\nnoid 2\u00b4-nitroflavone (2NF) is a potent and selective antitumor agent \nin vitro  and in vivo  in a murine LM3 breast cancer model. Sphin -\ngosine kinase 1 (SphK1), a lipid kinase overexpressed in some \nmammary tumor cells, regulates the balance between proapoptotic \nceramides and prosurvival sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Fur -\nthermore, safingol, a competitive SphK1 inhibitor, prevents catab -\nolism of ceramides, contributing to tumor cell death. It has been \nreported that certain flavonoids exert antitumor activity through an \nincrement in ceramide levels. Thus, we explored the antiproliferative \neffect of the simultaneous incubation of 2\u00b4NF and safingol in LM3 \ncells and found that they synergistically inhibited cell proliferation. \nBased on these results, we studied the apoptotic effect of 2NF in combination with safingol. When we evaluated the expression of bax \nproapoptotic protein, results obtained by Western blot showed that \neach compound alone did not modify bax expression, but a fivefold \nincrease was observed after cell incubation with both 2NF and saf -\ningol for 24 h (p<0.001). Similarly, results obtained by flow cytom -\netry showed a higher increment in the percentage of hypodiploid \ncells after simultaneous exposure to both compounds (p<0.001, 24h \nand p<0.05, 48 h). As recent reports demonstrated that some flavo -\nnoids inhibit SphK1 activity interacting directly with the kinase, we \nperformed molecular docking analysis with the docking web server \nSwissDock. Results obtained showed that safingol and 2NF would \nbind to different molecular regions of the SphK1.\nBased on the synergistic antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of \n2NF in combination with safingol, we propose that the interaction \nof both molecules with different sites of SphK1 would favor the gen -\neration of apoptotic ceramides by inhibiting the formation of S1P. \nFurther experimental approaches should be performed to confirm a \ndirect interaction of 2NF and SphK1. \n496.

Previously, using MeS NSG male mice injected s.c. with PC3 \nPCa cells, we demonstrated that DNMT1 and SUV39H1 expression \nlevels were repressed, while RIZ1 and GADD45A were increased in \nprostate tumors from MeS mice compared with control. Also, mRNA \nlevels of CDH1 and ZEB1 , two DNMT1 targets, were  repressed and \ninduced, respectively, in these tumors. Our hypothesis is  that aber -\nrant epigenetic changes in PCa favor tumor development and  pro-\ngression. Here we investigated expression and methylation levels \nof several  epigenetic genes in PCa patients using Xena database: \nDNMT1 , SUV39H1 , EZH2 , DNMT3A , DNMT3B , TET2 , TET3 , RIZ1 , \nEP300 , HDAC2, SIRT1 , HBO1 , CDH1 , ZEB1 , GADD45A and CDK -\nN1A. We found that\nGADD45A and CDKN1A mRNA levels were  significantly diminished \nin prostate tumors compared to normal adjacent tissue  (NAT). Ac -\ncordingly, methylation levels of GADD45A and CDKN1A were sig -\nnificantly  increased in comparison with NAT and between Gleason \nScores. Moreover, expression and methylation levels of other genes \ninvolved in epigenetic changes were significantly altered in prostate \ntumors vs NAT and between Gleason Scores. Additionally, to further \ninvestigate epigenetic changes mediated by miRNAs, we assessed \nthe expression levels of a panel of miRNAs involved in PCa de -\nvelopment. Altogether these data showed that aberrant expression \nand methylation of epigenetic genes, particularly the correlation be -\ntween the increased methylation and decreased expression levels \nof GADD45A and CDKN1A in prostate tumors from patients, might \nbe consider as promising mechanisms to further investigate in PCa \naggressiveness and even identifying novel biomarkers for patient \nprognosis.\n497.

In the tumor microenvironment (TME) cancer \nstem cells (CSC), which express CD133, CD44 and CD47 among \nother markers form residual cell niches involved in the recurrence af -\nter treatment. Hyaluronan (HA), a component of the TME, regulates, \nat least in part, the function of CSCs.  We previously demonstrat -\ned that tissue sections from murine Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) \ntumors present high levels of HA and it is higher on isolated LLC \nCSCs (CD133+) compared with the non-CSCs population (CD133-; \nby FACS). Our analysis of TCGA data from patients with NSLCS \nshowed that HA Synthase (HAS) 3 expression strongly correlates \nwith levels of transcription factors involved in CSC phenotype. We \nmodulated HA with the coumarin 4Mu, detecting an increase in the \nsensibility of LLC cells to paclitaxel (Pa). We aimed to cross-validate \nthe TCGA findings on whole LLC and isolated CD133+ cells after \nexposure to Pa or cisplatin (Cis), alone or in combination with 4Mu. \nWe analyzed the expression of HAS and CSCs genes by qPCR. \nThe expression of HA and their clonogenic and tumor-forming ca -\npability was also evaluated. Pa increases mRNA levels of HAS3 \n(p<0.05) and HAS2 (p<0.01) while LLC treated with Pa+ 0.25 mM \n4Mu showed reduced HAS3 levels(p<0.05). 4Mu also reduced HA \nlevels produced by LLC. CD47 and SOX2 gene expression were \nenhanced by Pa while they decreased with Pa+4Mu (p<0.05). About \n8.53 \u00b1 0.35% of LLC are CD133+, and express more HA compared \nto CD133- (p <0.05). Viability of CD133+ cells decreased when \ntreated with 4Mu+ Qx (Pa: p<0.01, Cis: p<0.05). Remarkably, 4Mu \nreduced the clonogenic (p<0.05) as well as tumor-forming ability of \nLLC CD133+ treated with Pa and Cis (p<0.05). We suggest that \n4Mu improves the efficacy of Qx to inhibit tumor progression and \ncould be implicated in preventing tumor recurrence.\n498.

COVID-19 can be asymptoma -\ntic or cause a respiratory distress syndrome and death. The risk of \nCOVID-19 and mortality for COVID-19 have been associated with \nolder age and comorbidities, such as cancer. The situation is a great \nchallenge for these patients. Furthermore, in patients with active \ntreatment, the decrease in cell populations involved in protection is \nvery common and immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may be impaired. \nOBJECTIVES: Here we described the population of oncological (P \nOn) and non-oncological (P NOn) patients with moderate or severe \nCOVID-19 hospitalized at the HUA from December, 2020 to Sep -\ntember, 2021. Peripheral blood samples were collected at different \ntimes to analyze the duration of the protective response (Elisa; flow \ncytometry). RESULTS: We incorporated 24 patients: 11 [45%] with \noncological disease in treatment, 5 male median age 59 with lung (4) and scalp (1) cancer and 6 female median age 36 with ovarian \n(1), cervix (2), renal (1) rectum (1) and breast cancer (1) with mode -\nrate (9) or severe (2) COVID-19 and 13 patients without oncological \ndisease [54%], 7 male median age 59 years, 6 female median age \n40, with moderate (12) or severe (1) COVID-19. The POn group had \na longer hospital stay (15.9 vs 8.8 days; p 0.016) and higher oxygen \nrequirement (high flow 36.4% vs 7.7%; p 0.085). The mortality rate \nin POn was 36% and there were no deaths in PNon. The circulating \nimmune response for SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed in 50 samples at \ndifferent times from the 24 hospitalized patients. The protective res -\nponse was significantly lower in the POn population (p <0.001) with \nlow detection of IgM and IgG. CONCLUSIONS: in POn the protecti -\nve response is lower compared to PNon, with probable implications \nin morbidity and mortality.\n499.

Felcher and Micaela N Stedile contributed equally \nto this study.\nWe have determined that R-spondin3 (RSPO3), a secreted protein \nthat potentiates Wnt signaling pathway, is a key modulator of tumor \nprogression and stem cell behavior in basal breast cancer. Previous \nreports indicated the potential role of RUNX1-CBF\u03b2 axis on Rspo3 \nexpression in mammary tumor cells. Besides, we found that treating \nbasal breast cancer cells with small molecules that block the inter -\naction between CBF\u03b2 and RUNX reduced Rspo3 mRNA and protein \nlevels. These treatments also induced inhibition of cell migration, \nan ability that was recovered upon addition of recombinant RSPO3. \nAlso, we have determined that those inhibitors enhanced the effects \nof the chemotherapeutic drug Doxorubicin on MDA-MB231 cell sur -\nvival and migration. To determine whether there is a direct control \nof RUNX1-CBF\u03b2 on Rspo3 mRNA transcription, we performed an \nin silico analysis of publicly available data from two RUNX1 CHIP-\nseq reports and an ATAC-seq study from human breast cell lines. \nWe aligned the emerging data with the occurrences of the RUNX1 \nDNA-recognition-motif in the Rspo3 locus. A few putative RUNX1 \nbinding sites were revealed by this analysis. Among them, a region \nlocated on Rspo3 first intronic region that seems to be particularly \nactive in triple negative breast cancer cells. Importantly, we have de -\ntermined that RUNX1 actually binds to that site in MDA-MB231 cells \nby ChIP-qPCR assay (3-fold increase compared to control). Then, \nto further explore the mechanisms underlying the control exerted \nby RUNX-CBF\u03b2 on Rspo3 expression, we proceeded to delete that \nRUNX1 binding site by introducing, through electroporation, Cas9 \nprotein together with specific sg-RNAs in MDA-MB231 cells.  We \nare currently analyzing the phenotype of the obtained cells to verify \nthe relevance of the discovered RUNX1 binding site. In summary, \nour results confirm that RUNX-CBF\u03b2 axis may contribute to basal \nbreast cancer progression by directly inducing Rspo3 expression in \nmammary tumor cells. \n500.

After lipofection, lipoplex-rich medium was reserved \nand cells were washed thrice with medium, to remove remaining \nlipoplexes. After the last wash, cells were cultured in fresh medium. \nConditioned media (CM) was obtained after 48 h of incubation from \nCDU- and HSVtk-lipofected cells with or without 5-FC and from unli -\npofected cells with or without 5-FU. The supernatant (SN) and pellet \n(P) fractions of the CM were obtained by centrifugation at 12000 \u00d7 g \nfor 60 min. These fractions were incubated on receptor cells with or \nwithout 5-FC, and cell viability was determined by the APH method \nafter 5 days.\nResults: As expected, the SN fraction of 5-FU CM was accountable \nfor bystander cytotoxicity, while the P fraction was not. In most cell \nlines only the SN fraction of CDU/5-FC treated cells was responsi -\nble for cytotoxicity, presumably given by 5-FU presence on the CM. \nInterestingly, the addition of 5-FC on cells that received both frac -\ntions of CDU CM caused significant cytotoxicity (p<0,05), indicating \ntransfer of the enzyme or its gene. While CDU lipoplex-rich medium \nwas able to deliver enzyme or its gene (p<0,05), the last-wash me -\ndium was unable to do it, denoting that there were no remaining \nlipoplexes on CM.\nConclusion: The CDU/5-FC suicide gene therapy system bystander \neffect would be mainly attributable to 5-FU and to the CDU fusion \nenzyme or its coded information (plasmid DNA o mRNA) carried by \nparticulate subcellular fractions.\n501. (506) THE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR REGULATES RUNX1, \nA NEW POTENTIAL WAY TO TARGET CHEMOTHERAPY \nRESISTANT TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER\nNatalia B Fern\u00e1ndez1, Sof\u00eda M Sosa1, Justin T Roberts2, \nJennifer K Richer3 and Natalia Rubinstein1\n1 Instituto de Biociencias, Biotecnolog\u00eda y Biolog\u00eda Traslacio -\nnal; Departamento de Fisiolog\u00eda, Biolog\u00eda Molecular y Celu -\nlar; Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales; Universidad \nde Buenos Aires.\n2 University of Colorado; School of Medicine; Department of \nBiochemistry and Molecular Genetics.\n3 University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Depart -\nment of Pathology.\nTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast can -\ncer (BC) subtype for which no effective targeted therapies are avail -\nable. Growing evidence suggests that chemotherapy-resistant BC \ncells with stem-like properties (CSC) may repopulate the tumor. \nTherefore, therapies that target the CSC in combination with chemo -\ntherapy might prevent tumor recurrence. Androgen Receptor (AR) is \nexpressed in at least half of all TNBC. AR inhibition decreases CSC \nin vitro and tumor initiation i n vivo . RUNX1 is regulated by AR in \nprostate cancer. In TNBC patients, RUNX1 protein levels correlate \nwith poor prognosis. Our group has shown that RUNX1 promotes \nTNBC cell migration and regulates tumor gene expression, such \nas the oncogene RSPO3 . Also, by RUNX1 ChIP assays, we found \nSOX4 as a  potential target gene. We hypothesized that RUNX1 is \nregulated by  AR and that both may work together in TNBC CSCs  to \npromote persistence and disease recurrence following chemother -\napy. Here we  show that, in MDA-MB-453 cells, RUNX1 expression \nis upregulated by  dihydrotestosterone, an AR agonist, and that this \neffect is blocked  in the presence of Enzalutamide (AR antagonist). \nChIP-seq experiments revealed  AR binding to RUNX1 regulatory re -\ngions, suggesting direct regulation. RUNX1  expression is increased \nin a CSC-like experimental model and responds  to AR activity. In -\nhibition of RUNX1 transcriptional activity by AI-10-104  (a synthetic \ndrug) reduced the expression of the CSC marker  SOX4. Interest -\ningly, this inhibition drives a reduction of MDA-MB-453 and  BT-549 \ncell proliferation and enhanced paclitaxel sensitivity. It was reported  \nthat AR inhibition combined with chemotherapy results in a more  \neffective outcome than chemotherapy alone in vitro and in vivo . In sum, RUNX1 inhibition may also be an attractive target to potentiate \nthe anti-tumor effect of AR inhibition, specifically in the slow growing \nCSC-like populations that resist chemotherapy and lead to meta -\nstatic disease.\n502.

TNBC expresses Vitamin D \nReceptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The \naim of this work was to investigate the involvement of VDR in the \nantitumor action of PTX in TNBC cells. To this end, viability assays \nby crystal violet staining were performed in murine 4T1 TNBC cells \nand in 4T1 stably expressing a shRNA against VDR (4T1 shVDR), \ntreated with PTX (10 nM) or vehicle. Also, cell cycle was studied by \nflow cytometry. Cellular studies were complemented with in silico \nanalyses including molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) \nsimulations to describe the pharmacodynamic interaction between \nPTX and VDR. The results show that PTX reduced the viability of \n4T1 wild type cells (p<0.001). These viability effects were lost in \n4T1 shVDR cells which display approximately 53% of VDR levels \nwith respect to control cells. Cell cycle analysis of 4T1 wild type and \n4T1 shVDR cells treated with PTX showed that the chemotherapy \ncauses an increase in the percentage of cells in sub G0/G1 phase \ncompared to vehicle-treated cells. However, this PTX effect was \nsignificantly higher in wild type than in VDR-silenced cells (13.72 \u00b1 \n2.37% vs 6.18 \u00b1 1.07%, p<0.001). Docking and MD studies showed \nthat PTX was not able to bind to the classical ligand-binding pocket \nof VDR. However, an exhaustive search of allosteric sites identified \nits stable binding to a cavity adjacent to the activating factor 2 (AF-\n2) region. MD studies verified a conformational restraint on AF-2, \nwhich triggers transcriptional and antitumor effects. Furthermore, a \npotential cooperativity in the interaction with VDR between PTX and \nthe natural ligand of the receptor was observed. Altogether, these \nresults suggest that PTX could interact with VDR to display its anti -\ntumor effects in TNBC by its binding in an alternative site to that of \nthe classical VDR agonists. \n503.

Its expression is highly correlated with \nproliferation in breast cancer specimens.\nIn this work, we aimed at investigating the potential antitumoral ac -\ntivity of 4 novel H3R antagonists, 1-(2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-2-yl)\nmethylpiperazines (LINS01 compounds), which showed excellent ABSTRACTS231\nselectivity and high affinity for the human H3R.1,2 Cell viability and \nproliferation were assessed by cell titer blue assay and colony \nformation in human MDA-MB-231 and murine 4T1 triple negative \nbreast cancer cells. Cell apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V \nstaining and flow cytometry, while cell migration was evaluated by \nwound-healing assay and transwell system. The lipid accumulation \nwas assayed by flow cytometry using Nile-red staining.\nResults indicate that compounds LINS01022, LINS01023, \nLINS01009, LINS01010 (0.1-100 \u03bcM) produced a concentration-de -\npendent inhibition on cell growth.

LINS01022 and LINS01023 (25-50 \u03bcM) \ninduced cell apoptosis (4 to 7 fold-increase) and differentiation (2 to \n3 fold-increase), while suppressed cell migration in both cell lines \n(P<0.01). \nThe allylpiperazines LINS01022 and LINS01023 exhibited better \nantiproliferative and proapoptotic effects together with a higher affi -\nnity constant for the H3R than their corresponding methylpiperazine \nanalogues LINS01009 and LINS1010, respectively. \nThese effects were not observed with the selective H3R agonist, \n(R)-alpha-methylhistamine.\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that the H3R is involved in the \nregulation of cell growth and progression, offering novel therapeutic \npotentials for H3R antagonists.\n1Correa et al.

The treatment of this disease has \nbeen the same for the past decades, and the development of new \ndrugs is needed. Hypoxia is a common characteristic of solid tu -\nmors, usually associated with a more aggressive phenotype. The \nmain transcriptional factor involved in this process is Hypoxia Induc -\nible Factor 1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1).\nThe present work aimed to study the effect of Acriflavine (ACR), a \nspecific HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor, on a human epithelial ovarian cancer mod -\nel (SKOV3), both in vivo and in vitro . For the in vitro  experiments, we \nperformed cell proliferation and wound healing assays to assess cell \nmigration with different ACR concentrations. Cell proliferation was \nsignificantly diminished with ACR 1uM after 72 hours of treatment as \ncompared with control cells (1 \u00b5M ACR: 22.69 % \u00b1 0.66 vs Control \n100,00% \u00b1 10,40 , p<0.0001), and migration was reduced with ACR \n1uM after 18 h of incubation (Control, 85,75% wound closure \u00b1 5,12 \nvs ACR 1uM, 52,40 % wound closure \u00b1 3,90, p<0.0001).\nFor the in vivo  experiments, 5 x 106 cells were s.c. injected into \nthe flank of immunosuppressed NSG mice. The treatment with ACR \ndaily injections (5 mg/kg, 15 days) started when tumors reached 25 \nmm2. ACR-treated tumors were significantly smaller than control \ntumors (p<0.001), showed a lower proliferation index ( Ki67) and a \nlower VEGF and GLUT1 expression through immunohistochemistry \nas compared with control tumor samples. VEGF and GLUT1 expres -\nsion are used to evaluate the transcriptional activity of HIF-1\u03b1, as \nboth proteins are HIF-1\u03b1 downstream targets.\nOur results show that HIF-1\u03b1 plays an important role in the pro -\nliferation, migration, and tumor growth of the SKOV3 ovarian can -\ncer model. We conclude that ACR could be a potential drug for the \ntreatment of ovarian cancer, alone or in combination with standard \ntherapy.\n505.

We \ndid a cross-sectional study of 80 patients with laboratory-confirmed \nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in -\nfection and with a pathological diagnosis of a malignant tumor from \nhospitals of city of Santa Fe and from Hospital Italiano (Buenos Ai -\nres). Clinical characteristics and cancer histories were investigated \nand analyzed.  \nDuring the study, 80 patients with cancer and laboratory-confirmed \nSARS-CoV-2 infection were included (median age 65 years). 45 \n(56,2%) patients were women and 34 (42,5%) were men. 72 pa -\ntients had solid tumours and 3 patients had haematological malig -\nnancies. The most frequently symptoms were fever (29 [40,28%] \npatients) and cough (28 [38,89%] patients); then dyspnoea (18 \n[25%] patients) and fatigue (19 [26,36%] patients). The most com -\nmon solid tumor types were breast (20 [26,7%] patients) and lung \ncancer (8 [10,7%] patients). 33 (41,25%) of 80 patients had comor -\nbidities: 11 (20,37%) had coronary disease, 10 (18,52%) had diabe -\ntes, 7 (12,96%) had chronic kidney disease and 5 (9,26%) chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease. The rate of mortility was of 18.75%. \nIn addition, if we analyze how many patients did not survive among \nthe cases with severe pneumonia (41,86%) and compare them with \nnon-severe pneumonia (16,28%), it gives an OR of 20.25 (2.32, \n176.6, p = 0.0028), indicating that severe pneumonia could be a \nrisk factor of mortality. Current statistics data from Argentina indi -\ncate that the rate of mortility of COVID-19 patients was 2% (114000 \nof 5240000). The data from our analysis indicates that cancer and \nCOVID-19 patients have an 8 times higher risk of death than pa -\ntients with only COVID-19.\nCancer patients have deteriorating conditions and together with a \nhigh frequency of comorbidities, these patients become a vulner -\nable population.

The immune cells present in the tumor \nmicroenvironment (TME) performs  dual functions, being able to \neliminate or promote malignancy according  to the signals present. \nWe believe that the dendritic cells (DCs) found in the TME play a \nfundamental  role in the development of the mammary tumor. Our \nhypothesis  is that there are different subpopulations and maturation \nprofiles of  DCs in the TME, and these profiles are associated with \ntumor traits  of mammary carcinomas. Initially, we propose as a gen -\neral objective  to study the different types of DCs present in the  TME \nand to determine the profile of these different subtypes  in human MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021232\nbreast carcinomas. Methodology : Once the tumors were obtained \nby surgery, breast carcinoma-derived fractions were mechanically \nand enzymatically disaggregated. Tumoral (EpCAM+) and non-tu -\nmoral (EpCAM-) populations of each fraction were isolated using \ncell sorting flow cytometry. DC populations were characterized  by \nflow cytometry using the HLA-DR, CD14, CD11c, CD1c cell  surface \nmarkers to perform the gating strategy. Results : We obtained tu -\nmoral and non-tumoral populations derived from eight human breast \ncarcinomas fractions. We defined four different DC subpopulations \npresent in the TME: pDCs, inflammatory DCs, cCD1 and cCD2 DCs. \nInterestingly, we observed that each tumoral fraction has a unique \nDC profile, according to the high heterogeneity already described \nfor this type of tumor. Based on the tumor cohort analysis, we ev -\nidenced a negative correlation between tumor cell and cDC2 DC \npopulations (r= -0.76, p<0.027). Conclusion : Breast TME contains  \ndifferent DC profiles associated with tumoral cell proportions in hu -\nman breast carcinoma fractions. Ongoing and future experiments \nwill allow us  to determine the maturation profiles of these DCs and \nanalyze  their relationship with genomic/epigenomic and clinicopath -\nological tumor characteristics.\n507.

Standard therapies for castration resis -\ntant prostate cancer (CRPC) include second-generation anti-andro -\ngens, such as Enzalutamide (Enz), which prolong patient lifespan. \nEmerging evidence indicates a regulatory role of Notch signaling in \nprostate development and growth. \nIn this work, we aimed to study the Notch and AR pathway involve -\nment and their interaction in prostate cancer.\nWe first determined the expression of Notch receptors (1/2/4) and \nthe proliferation marker PCNA by IHQ in prostate tumor samples \nobtained by surgery and its association with Gleasson score.  \nIn prostate cancer PC3 cells, we demonstrated AR expression by \nRT-qPRC. Instead, PSA expression was absent when evaluated \nculture cell supernantants by chemiluminescence. Moreover, under \nNotch pathway inhibition with DAPT, the expression of TMPRSS2 , \nan androgen dependent gene, showed lower levels after 24 h of \ntreatment (10 and 30 \u00b5M) by RT-qPCR (p=0.02; n=2). In turn, Enz \ntreatment (30 and 50 \u00b5M) reduced the levels of HES1, a target gene \nof the Notch pathway , determined by RT-qPCR (n=3).  \nWe observed significantly reduced viability of PC3 cells both with \nDAPT (p=0.0027; n=3) and Enz isolated treatments (p=0.0018; \nn=3) using MTS assay. Importantly, the combined treatment with \nDAPT and Enz significantly reduced PC3 viability at 48 and 72 h \n(p=0.0043; n=3). We observed reduced migratory abilities both with \nDAPT (p=0,0022; n=3) and Enzalutamide isolated treatment (p=ns; \nn=1.2), and also with the combined treatment (p=0,0526; n=3) using \nwound healing assay.  \nOur study suggests an interconnection between Notch and AR path -\nways in PCa. That would restrain in an alone or combined manner \nthe viability and migratory abilities of PC3 cells. Therefore, a com -\nbined approach consisting of Notch and AR inhibitors could be more \neffective than isolated antiandrogen treatment, especially in patients \nwith advanced and metastatic CRPC. \n508.

Then, \nwe hypothesize that extracellular pH (pHe) affects differently can -\ncer or normal cells. Our previous studies showed that, in cells de -\nrived from renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the isoform 1 of the Na+/H+ \nexchanger (NHE1) function is antiproliferative in media at pH 7.4. \nAlkalosis reverts this effect. On the other hand, in normal proximal \ncells, while at pH 7.4 NHE1 favors cells proliferation, NHE1 is an -\ntiproliferative alkaline media. The aim of this study was to further \ninvestigate this process. We use three renal cell models: HK2, de -\nrived from normal human proximal epithelial cells, 786-O and Caki-\n1, both derived from human RCC. We exposed cells to media with \n9.6 mM NaOH for 72h. Then, we estimated cell proliferation by BrdU \nexperiments in the presence of IA116, a Rho GTPases Rac1 inhib -\nitor and NHE1 expression by immunoblot studies.

This effect was \nreverted when NHE1 function was inhibited with 1\u03bcM HOE. Thus, \nRac function potentiated NHE1-related proliferation. In 786-O RCC \ncells, at media 7.4 Rac inhibition inhibited NHE1-related antiprolifer -\native effect (NHE1-induced proliferation: +Rac: 14\u00b12 vs -Rac= -8\u00b12, \np<0.001 n=16). We also investigated if NHE1 expression could \nchange with alkaline exposure. Our immunoblot studies showed \nthat normal renal cells had higher NHE1 expression than RCC cells \n(NHE1 expression HK2 5.4\u00b10.5 vs 786-O= 2.7\u00b10.2, p<0.01 n=8). \nExposure to alkaline media rose NHE1 expression only in RCC cells \n(NHE1 expression in 786-O pH7.4= 2.7\u00b10.2 vs pH=7.5= 4.5\u00b10.7, \np<0.05 n=8). In summary, Rac function would reduce NHE1-related \nproliferation in normal renal proximal cells. In RCC cells, however, \nNHE-1 related antiproliferative effect would depend on Rac function. \nFinally, these effects would not be related to NHE1 expression.\n511.

Of relevance TAF could be modu -\nlating response to treatment and overall microenvironment develop -\nment. Given that Osteosarcoma (OS) have the same 5-year survival \nrate for metastatic and treatment resistant patients since 1970\u00b4s, we \ndediced to investigate the role of TAF in OS primary and metastatic \nniches. \nAim: Evaluate TAF and human OS cell lines interaction in primary \nand pulmonary metastatic environments. To analyze if metastatic \nOS cell line has a higher inducing power than non-metastatic OS \ncell line analyzing the expression of different ABC transporters im -\nplicated in chemoresistance and the ability to exclude doxorubicin \nand rhodamine. \nMethods: The expression of ABC transporters was analyzed by \nRT-qPCR on conditioned fibroblast. Rhodamine 123 exclution assay \nwas used to determine the activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated \ntransport and doxorubicin (DOX) exclution was performed to analy -\nsis the overall ABC-related chemoresistant capacity. To evaluate the \ninteraction of fibroblast with metastatic (LM7) and non-metastatic (SAOS2) OS human cells hetero \u2013 spheroid formation assays were \nperformed. \nResults: LM7 conditioned medium (CM) induced an overall upreg -\nulation of ABC transporters in comparison with SAOS2 CM. Condi -\ntioned fibroblast with LM7 CM showed lower levels of intracellular \nDOX and Rhodomine in comparison with SAOS2 CM fibroblast. \nMixed spheroid compose of fibroblast ans OS cell lines display a \nlower area and more compact than single type aggregates. \nOS has not changed the 5-year rate survival for metastatic patients \nsince the 70\u2019, so the need to understand aspects of OS metastatic \nbiology and chemoresistance could be helpful to develop new treat -\nments to this group. Knowing aspects of the assocaited stroma and \nin particular TAF, could allow the development of new therapeutic \npossibilities targeting the tumoral associated stroma. \nQU\u00cdMICA MEDICINAL\n512.

Ferrer\nCentro de Qu\u00edmica Inorg\u00e1nica (CEQUINOR-CONII -\nCET-UNLP), La Plata, Argentina.\nObjective : The flavonoids can be chemically modified by complex -\nation with metals to be applied for adjuvant therapy.  In this con -\ntext, we evaluated the anticancer activity on the lung cancer cell line \nA549 of CuNarBatho. Nar: naringenin, Batho: bathophenanthroline. \nTheir bovine serum albumin (BSA) binding properties have also \nbeen evaluated.\nMethods : The effects of the compounds (CuNarBatho, CuNar, li -\ngands and metal) on the A549 cell viability were measured by MTT \nassay. To evaluate the probable mechanism of action, morpholog -\nical changes, intracellular reactive oxygen species ROS content \n(using CM-H2DCFDA probe), mitochondrial membrane potential \n(MMP) (using DIOC6 probe), and GSH depletion and cell viability \nin the presence of NAC were examined. The interaction between \nCuNarBatho and BSA was studied using tryptophan fluorescence \nquenching.\nResults:  CuNarBatho was more efficient than Batho, and Nar in \ninhibiting A549 cell viability (IC50 values 0.3, 12.1 and > 100 \u00b5M re -\nspectively at 24 h incubation). CuNar slightly inhibited cell viability. \nThe probable mechanism of action of the ternary complex implies \nincreased ROS levels, reduced GSH and GSH/GSSG ratio levels, \nand decreased MMP. Also, increment of cytoplasm condensation \nand presence of pycnotic nuclei were observed. Upon addition of \nNAC, the anticancer effect has been reverted. The binding constant \nvalues (Kb) for the CuNarBatho-BSA system are 36.2, 14.9 and 2.3 \n\u00d7 105 M\u22121 at 298, 303 and 310 K suggesting that the compound can \nbe stored and carried by the protein. The number of binding sites \nwas ca. 1.0 corresponding to the binding sites with high affinity. The \nnegative \u0394H and \u0394S values (-177.03 and -0.47 KJ/mol) obtained \nfor the interaction of CuNarBatho with BSA indicated that hydrogen \nbonding and Van der Waals forces played major roles during the \ninteraction. \nDiscussion : The results suggest that the CuNarBatho complex \ncould serve as a pharmacologically active compound for the treat -\nment of lung cancer.\n513.

Interaction with the micro -MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021234\nenvironment is one of the factors related with stemness. The aim of \nthe present work is to analyze the expression of extracellular matrix \nproteoglycans in CSC derived from cell lines. CSC were enriched by \nscaffold free 3D culture (colonospheres) of human colorectal cancer \ncell line HCT116 in the presence of bFGF and EGF, employing ul -\ntra-low attachment plates in serum-free culture conditions. After 14 \ndays of culture, microscopy studies were performed to assess colo -\nnosphere formation. Stemness was addressed by the expression \nof master genes SOX2, Nanog and CD44 by RT-PCR. Decorin and \nbiglycan proteoglycan\u00b4s core protein expression was also analyzed \nby RT-PCR. Moreover, glycosaminoglycan and protein quantifica -\ntion was addressed by ionic exchange chromatography of the cul -\nture medium followed by colorimetric determination. RT-PCR was \nperformed for the study of glycosaminoglycan synthesis enzyme \nexpression. Bright light microscopy showed colonospheres around \n50-100um. The expression of master genes was heterogeneous \namong cultures correlated with an heterogeneous expression of \ndecorin (number of experiments, n =3). On the other hand, no bigly -\ncan expression was detected among different colonospheres (n=3). \nNo differences were registered in glycosaminoglycan/protein ratio \namong spheres (0,274 \u00b1 0.127). Nevertheless, Chondroitin-4-O- \nSulfotransferase (C4ST) expression was detected in colonospheres \nwhile no expression was observed for Dermatan-4-O-Sulfotransfer -\nase (D4ST). The heterogeneity presented by 3D cultures represents \nthe heterogeneity reported for CSC within tumors and C4ST and \nD4ST pattern suggests differences in GAG chain\u00b4s quality. There -\nfore, colonospheres are a suitable model for the study of GAG en -\nzymes as potential therapeutic targets.\nREPRODUCCI\u00d3N\n514. (008) EXPRESSION OF TRANSGLUTAMINASE 2 AND \nHISTOMORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE \nOVIDUCT OF ADVANCED PREGNANT COWS\nPatricia E. Marini1,2, Juan M. Teijeiro1,3\n1Laboratorio de Medicina Reproductiva, FCByF, Universidad \nNacional de Rosario, 1,2IBR-CONICET, CIUNR-UNR, 1,3CO-\nNICET \u2013 jteijeiro@fbioyf.unr.edu.ar\nThe oviduct suffers changes during the estrous cycle in relation to \nits function in reproduction that are attributed in part to estrogen (E2) \nvariations. Raise of E2 and E2 receptors expression occurs along \npregnancy, thus we hypothesized that effects on the oviduct should \nbe observed in advanced pregnancy (AP). In this work, we studied \nchanges in the oviductal epithelium and fluid through the estrous \ncycle and AP in cows. In AP oviducts higher leaf-like folds were ob -\nserved and the width of the mucosa and height of the epithelium \nwere lower. Also, PAS-positive apical protrusions and TUNEL-pos -\nitive extruded cytoplasmic material were observed in oviducts from \ncows in AP. A particular protein was detected only in oviductal fluid of \npregnant cows. This protein was identified by LC/MS-MS as Trans -\nglutaminase 2 (TGM2) and its identity was confirmed by Western \nblot. TGM2 was detected in pregnant cows oviductal fluid but not \nin cells from any stage and its mRNA was present in differential \namounts in cells from every stage, indicating possible translation \nand/or secretion regulation during the estrous cycle and in pregnan -\ncy. TGM2 is related to apoptosis, protein modification, modification \nof extracellular matrix and cell growth/differentiation. Our results \nlead to the presumption that TGM2 may have a role in oviductal \nepithelium growth/differentiation. In conclusion, important morpho -\nlogical changes occur in the oviductal epithelium in advanced preg -\nnancy and secretion of TGM2 to the oviductal fluid is exclusive of \nthis period. These last may be regulated at several levels of expres -\nsion and of secretion, indicating an important role for the enzyme in \npregnant oviductal tissue.\n515.

Hospital General de Agudos Dr. Ignacio Pirovano, Buenos \nAires, Argentina\nObjectives: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a prevalent dis -\nease that increases the risk of maternal and fetal complications. \nPreviously, we found that a maternal diet enriched in extra virgin \nolive oil (EVOO) reduced the levels of proinflammatory markers and \ntriglycerides (TG) in maternal blood from GDM pregnancies. Here, \nwe aim to determine whether proinflammatory markers (interleukin \n6 (IL-6) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)), lipid profile and \nthe lipid chaperone Fatty Acid Binding Protein 4 (FABP4) levels are \naltered in umbilical cord blood from pregnancies with GDM treated \nor not with a diet enriched in EVOO.\nMethods: Fifty healthy (Control) and GDM patients were enrolled \n(protocol approved by Hospital Pirovano Ethics Committee) and \nadvised to follow the WHO diet for pregnancy. GDM patients were \nrandomized to receive or not 36 g/day of EVOO from week 24-28 \nof gestation until delivery. At delivery, cord blood was obtained to \nevaluate iNOS, IL-6 and FABP4 levels (Western blot), and TG, Total \nand HDL-Cholesterol (TC, HDL-C; colorimetric assay).\nResults: Neither IL-6 nor iNOS were altered in the three evaluated \ngroups compared to the controls. TG and HDL-C levels were de -\ncreased in umbilical cord blood from the GDM group compared to \ncontrols (25% and 7% respectively, p<0.05), alterations prevented \nby the diet enriched in EVOO. TC and FABP4 were unchanged in \nthe GDM groups treated or not with the EVOO diet compared to \ncontrols. \nConclusion: Despite the proinflammatory and metabolic alterations \npreviously observed in maternal blood, no alterations in proinflam -\nmatory markers, TC and FABP4 levels were observed in umbilical \ncord blood from GDM patients. The observed prevention of reduced \nHDL-C suggests an improvement in lipid metabolism in the EVOO \ngroup. Besides, the observed reduction in TG levels in cord blood \nfrom GDM patients may reflect lipid accretion in fetal tissues pre -\nvented in the EVOO group. \n516. (020) UTERINE ANORMALITIES AND PTEN EXPRESSION \nIN PCOS RAT MODEL\nGisela S. Bracho, Mar\u00eda V. Acosta, Gabriela A. Altamirano, \nEnrique H. Luque, Laura Kass, Ver\u00f3nica L. Bosquiazzo\nInstituto de Salud y Ambiente del Litoral (ISAL, UNL-CONI -\nCET), Facultad de Bioqu\u00edmica y Ciencias Biol\u00f3gicas, Univer -\nsidad Nacional del Litoral.\nWomen with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an increased \nrisk for developing endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Previously, \nwe demonstrated in the PCOS rat uterus an increase in epitheli -\nal height, gland density and thickness of subepithelial stroma and \nmyometrium. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phospha -\ntase (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor gene. Mutation or changes in \nPTEN expression is a frequent event in endometrial cancers. The \naims of this study were to investigate the presence of uterine ab -\nnormalities and to evaluate whether uterine PTEN expression was \naltered in PCOS rat model. Female rats were injected subcutane -\nously with sesame oil (Control group) or dehydroepiandrosterone \n(6mg/100g body weight, PCOS group) from 21 to 40 days of age. At \nday 41 the uterine horns were collected. Uterine abnormalities were \nstudied on histological sections counterstained with hematoxylin-eo -\nsin or picrosirius-hematoxylin. PTEN expression was evaluated by \nimmunohistochemistry. Uterine morphology showed stratification of \nluminal epithelium (more than 3 layers of cells), intraepithelial lu -\nmens, intraepithelial glands and polyps in treated rats. Also, different \nmorphological types of uterine glands were identified: cystic, dilated \nand/or tortuous, with squamous metaplasia, with cellular atypia and \nconglomerates of glands. The incidence of epithelial and glandular \nabnormalities increased in PCOS rats (Control: 28.6 % vs PCOS: \n100%, Control: 0 % vs PCOS: 90.9%, respectively). In this group \nof rats, PTEN expression was not modified in the glandular epithe -\nlium, whereas decreased in the luminal epithelium, subepithelial ABSTRACTS235\nstroma and myometrium (p<0.05). These results suggest that the \ndecreased PTEN expression in the uterus could be associated with \nthe greater development of endometrial abnormalities observed in \nPCOS rat. \n517. (021) LACTOFERRIN AFFECTS FERTILIZATION AND EM -\nBRYO IMPLANTATION IN RATS\nAldana Gola, Estefan\u00eda Massa, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Madariaga, Ma -\nrianela Moriconi, Fabi\u00e1n Pelusa, Sergio Ghersevich \nArea of Clinical Biochemistry, Facultad de Ciencias Bioqu\u00edmi -\ncas y Farmac\u00e9uticas UNR, Rosario, Argentina.\nPreviously we found that lactoferrin (LF) is present in the human \noviduct secretion and it can bind to both gametes and reduce the \ngamete interaction. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect \nof LF on the acrosome reaction (AR), in vitro  fertilization (IVF) and \nimplantation in Wistar rats. Rat cauda epididymal sperm (SP) were \nincubated under capacitating conditions in the absence or presence \nof LF (10 and 100 \u00b5g/ml) at 37\u00b0C and 5% PCO2. SP were then incu -\nbated with or without 20 \u00b5M progesterone to determine the induced \nand spontaneous AR, respectively, by Coomassie blue staining. For \nIVF, oocytes were recovered from the oviduct of rats (80 days) after \novarian stimulation and placed in HTF medium, inseminated with SP \nand incubated in the absence (controls) or presence of LF (1, 10 and \n100 \u00b5g/ml) at 37\u00baC and 5% PCO2 for 24 h. To estimate the IVF rate, \npronucleus formation was detected with Hoechst 33258. For the in \nvivo study, female rats (80 days, n=23) were placed with a male on \nthe day prior to proestrus. From the following diestrus, females were \nrandomly assigned to one of four treatment groups and received a \ndaily i.p. injection of 0.9%w/v NaCl (controls), 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 \nmg LF/kg, for 8 days. Then, they were sacrificed and the implanta -\ntion sites in uterus were assessed, considering the average number \nin controls as 100%. The presence of 10 \u00b5g/ml LF (51.43\u00b13.95%; \np<0.05) and 100 \u00b5g/ml LF (49.96\u00b13.2%, p<0.05) increased the \nspontaneous AR respect to controls (38.5\u00b12.3%), but did not af -\nfect the induced AR. LF presence decreased the IVF rate (control: \n68.7\u00b15.3% vs. LF 10: 41.03\u00b16.6%, p<0.05; LF 100: 31.43\u00b16.4%, \np<0.001). The implantation  decreased in rats treated with 100 or \n200 mg LF/kg (LF 100: 0%, p<0.001; LF 200: 10.7\u00b18,9%, p<0.001). \nThe results suggest a dose-dependent effect of LF on fertilization \nand implantation in rats. Likewise, the presence of LF stimulated the \nspontaneous AR, which could contribute to the reduction observed \nin the IVF rate.\n518. (031) TRANSGENERATIONAL CHANGES CAUSED BY DI -\nET-INDUCED MATERNAL OBESITY AT REPRODUCTIVE \nLEVEL\nMeneghini Mar\u00eda Agustina, Flores Quiroga Jerem\u00edas, Faletti \nAlicia Graciela\nCentro de Estudios Farmacol\u00f3gicos y Bot\u00e1nicos ( CEFY -\nBO-CONICET ), Facultad de Medicina, UBA\nPreviously, we demonstrated that female offspring from overfed rats \nexhibit higher body and ovarian weight, early puberty, lower num -\nber of immature follicles, higher ovulatory rate and lower number of \nhealthy oocytes than control animals. In the present work, we contin -\nued evaluating the effects of maternal obesity caused by the diet on \nthe reproductive capacity and outcome in the female offspring (F1) \nand some parameters of their offspring (F2). \nTo this end, female offspring from rats fed standard (F1OSD) or caf -\neteria (F1OCD) diet were used. At 60 days of age, both groups were \nmated with control males on the day of proestrus and euthanized at \ndifferent times. Fertility, gestation, viability and lactation indices were \nevaluated in these offspring.\nBetween 45% and 80% of the F1OCD rats exhibited significant \nchanges compared to the F1OSD group: i) a longer estrous cycle \n(5.5\u00b10.4 vs 4.1 \u00b10.1, p<0.05); ii) a decrease in the fertility index \n(12.7 \u00b10.3 vs 15.5 \u00b10.5, p<0.05) and litter size (11.7 \u00b10.4 vs 14.7 \u00b10.3, \np<0.01); and iii) a lower male to female ratio (0.77 \u00b10.08 vs 1.5 \u00b10.2, \np<0.01). No differences were found in the gestation, viability or lac -\ntation indices. \nComparison of some parameters of the offspring from F1 (F2O -\nCD) with controls (F2OSD) showed that i) both the female and male F2OCD groups exhibited lower body weight at birth (7.9 \u00b10.2 \nvs 9.6 \u00b10.2; 8.2 \u00b10.3 vs 10.3 \u00b10.1; respectively, p<0.001) and an in -\ncrease in the weight gain at 21 days of age (570 \u00b120 vs 460 \u00b130, \n550\u00b120 vs 440 \u00b110, respectively, p<0.05). Also, these F2OCD rats \nshowed a decrease in the gonadal indices (1.3 \u00b10.05 vs 1.6 \u00b10.09, \nx104; 2.12 \u00b10.05 vs 2.53 \u00b10.07, x103; respectively, p< 0.05).  \nThese results suggest that maternal obesity, induced by the diet, \nmay severely affect the reproductive ability of their offspring, likely \nas a result of altering organogenesis, which may also cause trans -\ngenerational systemic and reproductive disorders.\n \n519. (038) ECS FROM PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR \nCELLS IS MODULATED IN AN LPS-INDUCED PRETERM \nMURINE MODEL  \nCarolina Marvaldi, Julieta A Schander, Julieta Aisemberg, \nAna M Franchi, Manuel L Wolfson. \nPreterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity \nin neonates.  The endocannabinoid system (ECs) is one of several \nsignaling pathways involved in different aspects of the physiopathol -\nogy of reproduction, comprising the enzyme that synthesizes AEA, \n(N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D, NAPE-\nPLD), the enzyme that hydrolase AEA (fatty acid amide hydrolase, \nFAAH), and the receptors CB1, CB2 and TRPV1. Previous works \nfrom our lab have demonstrated that LPS altered FAAH activity in \ndeciduas and PBMC in an embryo resorption model. Using a murine \nmodel of preterm labor, induced by two injections of LPS on day 15 \nof pregnancy, we demonstrated that ECs of the decidua is involved \nin the triggering of PTB. Due to the decidua is highly infiltrated by \nimmune cells, in this study we investigated if the ECs of peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is modulated in our LPS-induced \npreterm labor model. \nWe observed that CB1 receptor protein levels increased in PBMC \nafter LPS treatment (p<0.05). However, CB2 and TRPV1 receptors \nprotein levels were not modified by LPS.  \nRegarding the enzyme that synthesizes AEA, (N-acylphosphatidy -\nlethanolamine-specific phospholipase D, NAPE-PLD), we observed \nthat its protein levels were diminished in PBMC from LPS treated \nmice (p<0.05).  \nOn the other hand, the enzyme that degrades AEA (fatty acid amide \nhydrolase, FAAH) protein levels were diminished in PBMC after LPS \ntreatment (p<0.05). Also, we evaluated FAAH activity by radiocon -\nvertion and we observed that FAAH activity is decreased in PBMC \nfrom LPS-treated mice. \nIn summary, these data show that endocannabinoid system from \nperipheral blood mononuclear cells could be implicated in the pro-in -\nflammatory response associated with LPS-induced preterm birth.\n520.

On the other hand, glu -\ntaminase (GLS), which converts glutamine into glutamate, plays a \nvital role in up-regulating cell metabolism for cell growth, and even, \nthe glutamine catabolism might be required for the fully activation of \nmTORC1/p70S6K pathway. Previously, we have demonstrated that \nFSH increases the expression of GLS isoform 2 in proliferating SC, \nhowever, the role of GLS activity in the regulation of SC proliferation \nremains unknown. The aim of this work was to analyze whether SC \ndepends on glutaminolysis to proliferate. SC obtained from 8-day \nold rats were maintained in the absence or presence of a pharmaco -\nlogical inhibitor of GLS -6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) 500 \u03bcM- \nunder basal conditions (B) or stimulated with FSH 100ng/ml.

Results are expressed as \nmean\u00b1SD of three independent experiments (Different letters indi -\ncate statistically significant differences, P<0.05). DON prevented \nFSH from stimulating BrdU incorporation (B:5.6\u00b10.7a; DON:1.6\u00b10.6b; \nFSH:9.7\u00b11.5c; FSH+DON:1.4\u00b10.7b %BrdU-positive cells) and c-Myc \ntranscriptional activity. In addition, FSH was unable to activate \np70S6K in the presence of DON (DON:0.60\u00b10.25a; FSH:2.30\u00b10.52b; \nFSH+DON:0.74\u00b10.28a fold variation P-p70S6K/\u03b2-tubulin vs. B). \nThese results suggest that glutaminolysis might be necessary for \nthe regulation of SC proliferation by modulating mTORC1/p70S6K \npathway.

SC were isolated from 8-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats \nand incubated under basal conditions (B) or stimulated with ActA \n(50 ng/mL) during different periods of time. Results are expressed \nas X\u00b1SD, n=3 (*p<0.05; **p<0.01 vs B). In agreement with previous \nreports, BrdU incorporation assays showed that ActA increased SC \nproliferation (B:5.0\u00b10.8; ActA:8.8\u00b1 0.7** % BrdU positive cells). In \nwestern blot analysis, ActA induced higher levels of phosphorylated \nAKT and p70S6K (2.9\u00b10.6*and 1.8\u00b10.5* fold change vs. B) after 1-h \ntreatment suggesting the activation of classical signaling pathways \nlinked to cell proliferation. Regarding cell cycle regulated proteins, \nActA significantly increased both c-Myc mRNA levels measured by \nRT-qPCR and c-Myc transcriptional activity in a luciferase reporter \nassay. Cyclin D1 mRNA levels remained unchanged whereas Cyclin \nD2 mRNA levels showed a maximal increase (5.5\u00b10.7** fold change \nvs. B) after 4 h. Cyclins E1 and E2 mRNA levels showed an increase \n(1.9\u00b10.3** and 1.8\u00b10.3** fold change vs. B) after 24 h of treatment. \nOverall, these results suggest that ActA stimulates SC proliferation \nincreasing c-Myc activity and cyclins expression as well as activat -\ning signaling pathways classically linked to cell cycle progression. \n(PICT:2015-228; 2018-1291).\n522.

Among others, urogenital infections are known causes of \ninfertility. In fact, infertility have been associated to Chlamydia tra -\nchomatis (Ct), Ureaplasma spp. (Uu) and Mycoplasma hominis (Mh) \nurogenital infections. However, evidence from large studies assess -ing their prevalence and putative associations in patients with infer -\ntility is still scarce. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence and \nassociations of Ct, Uu and Mh infection in women and men seek -\ning care for infertility. A cohort of 5464 patients with a diagnosis of \ncouple\u2019s primary infertility and 404 control individuals were enrolled. \nCervical-swab and semen samples were collected from female and \nmale individuals, respectively, and infections assessed by PCR or \nculture. Overall, the prevalence of Ct, Uu and Mh urogenital infection \nwas significantly higher in patients than in control individuals (5.3%, \n22.8% and 7.4% versus 2.0%, 17.8% and 1.7%, respectively). Ct \ninfection was more prevalent in male than in female patients (OR: \n1.36, p=0.034 ), being males younger than 25 years at the highest \nrisk (OR: 2.51, p=0.002 ). Conversely, Uu and Mh infections were \nmore prevalent in female patients, since males were less likely at \nrisk of Uu (OR: 0.52, p<0.001 ) and Mh (0.41, p<0.001 ) infection. In \naddition, Uu infection was more prevalent in patients younger than \n25 years, either in women (OR: 2.27, p=0.003) or men (OR: 1.66, \np=0.034 ). Finally, a significant association between Mh and Uu in -\nfections was found in either female (OR: 33.84, p<0.0001 ) or male \n(OR: 71.83, p<0.0001 ) patients. Our data revealed that Ct, Uu and \nMh are prevalent uropathogens in patients with couple\u2019s primary in -\nfertility. Taken together, our results show the importance of including \nthe screening of urogenital infections in the diagnostic work up of \nmale infertility.\n523.

(083) NEW ADVANCES IN THE USE OF MELATONIN AS A \nFERTOPROTECTIVE AGENT DURING CHEMOTHERAPY\nGonzalo Oubi\u00f1a1, Natalia Pascuali1, Leopoldina Scotti1, Ma-\nr\u00eda May2, Yamila Herrero1, Dalhia Abramovich1, Fernanda \nParborell1\n1Instituto de Biolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental \u2013 CONICET, \nBuenos Aires, Argentina.\n2Instituto de Investigaciones Farmacol\u00f3gicas, Facultad de \nFarmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Bue -ABSTRACTS237\nnos Aires, Argentina\nCorrespondencia: gonza.oubina@gmail.com\nMelatonin (MEL) is a neurohormone with a potent antioxidant activ -\nity. Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a pathology defined as the \ndepletion of the ovarian reserve; one of its causes is chemotherapy. \nCurrently treatments for POF have proven to be ineffective. The aim \nof the present study is to assess whether MEL can protect ovaries \nfrom chemotherapy-induced gonadotoxicity using a mice model of \nPOF induced by cyclophosphamide (CTX). Previously, we have re -\nported that MEL enhances the % of antral follicles, diminishes the \n% of atretic follicles and increases SOD1 expression in POF model.  \nTo induce POF, CTX was administered (75 mg/kg, i.p.) to F1 mice \n(C57XBalbC, 6-8 weeks old) on day 1. CTX+MEL group also re -\nceived MEL (15 mg/kg, i.p.) on days 1, 6 and 11. Animals were sacri -\nficed on day 15 and their ovaries processed for histological analysis. \nData was analysed by ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s test.\nHistopathological analysis of ovarian sections showed that CTX \ncaused fibrotic foci and blood vessel hyalinization; MEL decreased \nthese parameters. IHC for AMH (ovarian reserve marker) showed \nthat CTX diminished the % of follicles expressing AMH compared to \ncontrol (p<0.05), whereas MEL increased this parameter compared \nto CTX (p<0.05). IHC for DDX4 (oocyte marker) revealed that CTX \ndiminished the number of primordial follicles compared to control \n(p<0.05), whereas MEL increased it (p<0.05). IHC for CD31 (endo -\nthelium marker) revealed that CTX reduced the blood vessel density \ncompared to control (p<0.05), while IHC for \u03b1-SMA (vascular stability \nmarker) showed that CTX reduced mature vessel density (p<0.05). \nMEL increased these parameters compared to CTX (p<0.05).\nIn conclusion, these results, combined with our previous report, sug -\ngest that MEL could protect ovarian function from gonadotoxicity, \npreventing primordial follicle loss and restoring vascular function. \nMEL might represent a non-invasive treatment to preserve female \nfertility in patients undergoing chemotherapy.\n525.

Facultad de Medicina. Universidad de Bue -\nnos Aires, Argentina.\nLow spermatogenic efficiency in infertile men is not only due to post \nmeiotic events, but also to decreased meiotic activity and sper -\nmatogonia (Spg) number. We demonstrated that Spg decreased \nnumber negatively correlates with the number of immune cells in \ntesticular biopsies of azoospermic patients. Proinflammatory agents \nnitric oxide (NO) and TNF\u03b1 produced by the immune cells that infil -\ntrate the testis might impair spermatogenesis. Our objective was to \nevaluate the effect of NO and TNF\u03b1 on Spg and preleptotene sper -\nmatocyte (PLs) proliferation and spermatogenesis progression in \nadult Wistar rats. DETA-NOnoate (DETA-NO), a NO donor, or TNF\u03b1 \nwere injected in one testis, saline was injected in the contralateral \ntestis. On day 5, a group of animals received BrdU injection (ip) and \nwere euthanized 2h later in order to evaluate proliferation, by immu -\nnofluorescense. Another group was sacrificed on day 60 to evaluate \nthe effect on spermatogenesis. DETA-NO (2 and 10mM) significantly \nreduced the number of BrdU+Spg/seminiferous tubule (ST) (p<0.05, \nStudent paired t test, n=3) and the number of BrdU+PLs/ST (p<0.01; \nStudent paired t test, n=3) vs saline. These events slowed seminif -\nerous epithelial cycle, demonstrated by the significant reduction in \nthe number of ST at VII-VIII stage (p<0.01; Student t test, n=3). Vari -\nations in STs\u2019 area reflect the magnitude of spermatogenesis dam -\nage; after 60d DETA-NO (2 and 10mM) significantly increased the \nfrequency of STs of small and reduced area respectively vs. saline \n(p<0.05; Student t test, n=3). TNF\u03b1 (0.1 and 1\u00b5g) exposure affects \nneither Spg nor PLs proliferation or spermatogenesis. \nWe demonstrated that NO arrests the cell cycle of premeiotic GCs, \nlimiting Spg mitotic amplification division and the entrance of PLs in \nmeiosis. These events might generate time gaps in the spermato -genic wave lastly affecting sperm production.\n526.

Facultad de Medicina. Universidad de Bue -\nnos Aires, Argentina.\nExperimental autoimmune orchitis (EAO) is a well-established ro -\ndent model of organ specific autoimmunity associated to infertility. \nTestis immunopathology is similar in rats and humans undergoing \na chronic testicular inflammation. A comparative analysis of other \naspects of the disease like the quantification of spermatogonia (Spg) \nand Sertoli cells (SCs), by immunohistochemistry, as well as the hor -\nmonal serum profile of infertile patients with idiopathic orchitis vs rats \nwith EAO was undertaken (RIA). We evaluated testicular biopsies \nfrom patients with idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia, diag -\nnosed with hypospermatogenesis (mild: n=8, severe: n=10) (HypE) \nand Sertoli cell only syndrome (SCOS, n=9). All groups displayed \ntwice the number of immune cells (CD45+) vs patients with obstruc -\ntive azoospermia and complete spermatogenesis (control group, C, \nn=8). The number of undifferentiated and differentiated SPg/semi -\nniferous tubule (ST) decreases in mild and severe HypE while the \nnumber of SCs/STs increases in severe HypE and SCOS vs. control \n(p<0.01). In EAO undifferentiated Spg (CD9+) increased in focal and \ndecreased in severe EAO vs. normal (N) rats. Differentiated SPg \n(c-Kit+)/ST decreases (mean\u00b1SEM, N:10.5\u00b10.3, focal EAO:4.4\u00b10.1, \nsevere EAO:3.1\u00b10.3, p<0.05, n=3) and the SCs/STs number in -\ncreases vs. N (mean\u00b1SEM, N:10.14\u00b11.13, focal EAO:17.32\u00b12.24, \nsevere EAO:19.5\u00b13.5, p<0.05, n=3). FSH, was higher in severe \nHypE vs C and also in severe EAO vs N. Testosterone and LH were \nsimilar to C in severe HypoE and also in severe EAO vs N. Pro -\nlactin in mild and severe HypoE was similar to C and in focal and \nsevere EAO was similar to N (mean\u00b1SEM ng/ml, N:13.1\u00b12.0, focal \nEAO:10.2\u00b11.8, severe EAO:14.9\u00b12.8, n=11).\nWe showed that particularly the late stages of EAO closely reflect \nSpg and SCs behavior, and hormonal profile observed patients with \nsevere HypE. These results validate EAO as a valuable model for \nstudying the impact of inflammatory processes on spermatogenesis. \n527.

Chol is es -\nsential for testosterone synthesis and spermatogenesis, and must \nbe maintained in an optimal range for proper functioning of the tes -\ntes. Rabbits on a high-fat diet (HFD) exhibit hypercholesterolemia \nassociated with poor seminal quality, related to cholesterol overload \nin seminiferous tubule cells. Sterol regulatory element-binding pro -\ntein (SREBP)-2 governs the cholesterol pathway in testis and it is \nsensitive to dietary lipids. We have previously seen that Extra Vir -\ngin Olive Oil (EVOO) supplementation improved semen parameters \naffected by high fat diet. The aim of this study was to explore the \neffects of EVOO supplementation to HFD on rabbit testes at the \nmolecular level, analyzing the SREBP-2 pathway. Male New Zea -\nland White rabbits were fed commercial rabbit pellet (normocholes -\nterolemic rabbits: NCR), a high-fat diet (plus 14% bovine grease, \nhypercholesterolemic rabbits, HCR), or 7% bovine grease plus 7% \nEVOO (HCR + EVOO). Serum lipid levels, body weight and seminal MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021238\nparameters were measured, and mRNA and protein levels of the \nSREBP-2 pathway were assessed by PCR, Western blotting and \nimmunofluorescence. At 12 months of diet, HCR rabbits show an \nincrease in the expression of SREBP 2 and downstream molecules \nof the pathway: HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A \nreductase) and LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor). Interesting -\nly, the addition of EVOO showed a recovery in the expression of \nthe mentioned proteins. In addition, preliminary studies of SREBP-2 \nregulatory molecule, INSIG1 (Insulin induced gene 1), and the mol -\necule responsible for the esterification of cholesterol, SOAT2 (Sterol \nO-Acyltransferase 2), showed no significant changes between diets \nso far. The data showed that dietary supplementation with EVOO \npromoted testicular improvements by modifying the expression of \ncholesterol pathway regulated by SREBP2.\n528.

The aim of this study was to analyse the \ngene and protein expression levels of the members of IL-1 family: \nIL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1RI, IL-1RII and IL-1RA during postpartum period, \nand their possible association with delayed conception.\nEndometrial biopsies were obtained from multiparous Holstein cows \n(n=16) at 45 and 60 days in milk (DIM). The voluntary waiting period \nof cows was 70 days. All procedures were approved by the Ethics \nCommittee (FCV-UNL). The gene expression of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1RI, \nIL-1RII and IL-1RA was analyzed by real-time PCR. The immuno -\nlocalization of the cytokines was assessed by indirect immunohis -\ntochemistry.\nKaplan\u2013Meier test was used to evaluate the possible association \nbetween the gene and protein levels of each cytokine and delayed \nconception. Then, when the results from Kaplan-Meier showed sig -\nnificant association, we grouped the animals like \u2018fewer number of \ndays to conception\u2019 (FDC) and \u2018greater number of days to concep -\ntion\u2019 (GDC) for comparison. To analyze the differential expression \nlevels over time in FDC and GDC groups, a Generalized Linear \nModel was used considering DIM as a fixed factor. The gene expres -\nsion of all members of IL-1 family showed no significant association \nwith delayed conception. However, the association between the pro -\ntein expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1RA in glandular epithelium (GE) \nand delayed conception was significant. Then, the GLM showed no \nsignificant differences in GE between 45 and 60 DIM, both in the \nFDC and GDC group. These results suggest a potential role of some \nmembers from IL-1 family, as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1RA, in the mechanisms \ninvolved to early conception.\n529.

SC actively metabolize glucose but \nmost of it is converted to lactate, an energy source for germ cells. SC also oxidize fatty acids (FA) to sustain their energy status. SC \nhave numerous lipid droplets (LD), which are thought to be the site \nof storage of FA. In this context, we have demonstrated that leptin \n(Lep), an adipokine that is present in the testis, increases triacyl -\nglycerols (TAGs) and LD content in SC. Several proteins such as \nthe FA transporter FAT/CD36, the enzymes involved in the synthesis \nof TAGs (glycerol-phosphate-acyl-transferases (GPATs) and diacyl -\nglycerol-acyl-transferase 1 (DGAT)), and the proteins associated \nwith LD formation (PLINs) have a role in lipid storage. The aim of \nthis study was to analyze the effects of Lep on the expression of pro -\nteins involved in FA storage. SC isolated from 20-day-old rats were \ncultured and maintained under basal conditions (B) or stimulated \nwith Lep (100 ng/ml). mRNA levels of FAT/CD36, GPAT1-4, DGAT1 \nand PLIN1-3 were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Results are expressed as \nmean\u00b1SD, n=3, (* p<0.05 vs B). Lep increased FAT/CD36, GPAT3, \nand PLIN1 mRNA levels at 48 h (1.8\u00b10.2*; 1.5\u00b10.2* and 1.8\u00b10.1* \nfold variation vs. B). To elucidate which signaling pathways are in -\nvolved in Lep regulation of FA storage, SC were treated with Lep \nin the presence of 1 \u00b5M Static (STAT3 inhibitor), 1 nM Rapamicyn \n(mTORC1 inhibitor) or 50 \u00b5M T0070907 (PPAR\u03b3 antagonist). Then, \nLD content was analyzed by Oil Red O staining. Neither of the in -\nhibitors tested modified leptin-stimulated LD number. Altogether, the \nresults suggest that Lep regulates the expression of genes involved \nin FA transport, TAG synthesis, and LD formation as a mechanism to \nincrease lipid storage. Further studies will be necessary to clarify the \nsignaling pathways participating in the above-mentioned regulation. \n(PICT2015-228; PICT2018-1291). \n530.

Semen specimens were collected by \nmasturbation, semen analysis performed according to the WHO \nguidelines, and inflammatory cytokines quantitated by ELISA.\nSignificantly higher levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 were found in \nsemen from patients recovered from mild and/or severe COVID-19 \nwith respect to control individuals (p\u02c20.02, p\u02c20.02 and p\u02c20.001, re -\nspectively). Moreover, patients recovered from mild and/or severe \nCOVID-19 showed significantly reduced semen volume (p\u02c20.001), \nlower total sperm counts (p\u02c20.03), and impaired sperm motility \n(p\u02c20.02) and viability (p\u02c20.01). Remarkably, no significant differences \nwere found in semen leukocyte counts from patients and controls \n(p\u02c30.001).\nWe provide experimental evidence indicating that COVID-19 asso -\nciates with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in semen and \nsignificant alterations in sperm quality. Although it should be inter -\npreted carefully, these findings indicate an adverse but potentially \nreversible consequence of COVID-19 on sperm quality. Although \nbeyond our current understanding of the disease, our data suggest \nthat the reproductive function of patients recovering from COVID-19 \nshould be precisely followed and evaluated to detect and avoid more \nserious reproductive problems in the future.\n532. (146) EFFECT OF MATERNAL DIETS ENRICHED IN PU -\nFAS ADMINISTRATED TO DIABETIC RATS DURING EAR -\nLY POSTIMPLANTATION ON STRUCTURES INVOLVED IN \nDECIDUAL HISTOTROPHIC FUNCTION AND FETO-PLA -\nCENTAL GROWTH\nSabrina Lorena Roberti, Cintia Romina Gatti, Mar\u00eda Laura \nLeonardi, Romina Higa, Alicia Jawerbaum.\nLaboratory of Reproduction and Metabolism - CEFyBO-CO -\nNICET. School of Medicine, University of Buenos Aires, Bue -\nnos Aires, Argentina.\nMaternal diabetes induces alterations in decidualization, which may \nimpact on decidual histotrophic function that include key roles of the \nuterine glands (UG) and the glycogenic area (GA). uNK cells, in -\nvolved in angiogenesis and vessels remodeling, are needed for an \nadequate decidualization and feto-placental development. We pre -\nviously found that maternal diets enriched in polyunsaturated fatty \nacids (PUFAs) prevent increased resorption rates in diabetic preg -\nnancies. Aim: To evaluate the effect of diets enriched in sunflower \nand chia oil (rich in n-6 and n-3 PUFAs respectively) administrated \nduring early postimplantation to diabetic rats on PAS staining of the \nGA and UG and on the number of uNK cells at day 9 of pregnancy \nand on decidual, fetal and placental growth at day 14 of pregnan -\ncy. Methods: Pregestational diabetes was induced in Wistar rats \nby streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). On days 7 to 9 of pregnancy diabetic \nrats received a standard diet or diets enriched in 6% of sunflower \nor chia oil. On day 9 of pregnancy GA, UG and uNK cells in the de -\ncidua were evaluated by PAS staining. On day 14 of pregnancy the \nfetal cephalic length was measured and the decidua and placenta \nwere weighted. Results:  At day 9 of pregnancy PAS staining of GA \n(p<0.001;74%) and UG (p<0.05;64%) and the number of uNK cells \n(p<0.001;62%) were reduced in diabetic rats, alterations prevented \nby the PUFAs enriched diets. At day 14 of pregnancy a decreased \nfetal cephalic length in diabetic rats (7.5%; p<0.05) was prevented \nby the sunflower oil supplementation. Both decidual (18.3%;p<0.05) \nand placental (12.4%;p<0.05) weights were decreased in the diabet -ic group. The diet enriched in sunflower oil prevented the reduced \ndecidual weight while the diet enriched in chia oil prevented the re -\nduced placental weight. Conclusion: The early postimplantation is a \nkey period for decidual and feto-placental development, affected by \nmaternal diabetes, and in which dietary treatments can exert ben -\neficial effects.\n533. (150) LEUKOCYTES INFILTRATION CHAPERONES \nHYPERTHYROIDISM-INDUCED INCREASE OF FETAL \nGROWTH, PLACENTAL CHANGES, AND IMPAIRED OFF -\nSPRING DEVELOPMENT \nS\u00e1nchez MB, Neira FJ, Moreno Sosa MT, Michel MC, Pietro -\nbon EO, Soaje M, Valdez SR, Jahn GA, Mackern-Oberti JP. \nInstituto de Medicina y Biolog\u00eda Experimental de Cuyo, Uni -\nversidad Nacional de Cuyo (IMBECU-CCT-CONICET).\nHyperthyroidism (HP) induces reproductive disorders like preterm \nbirth and lactation failures and could influence immune cells ho -\nmeostasis. Therefore, our work aimed to evaluate the role of thy -\nroid hormones in leukocytes in milk and placenta. To this end, 12 \nweeks old Wistar rats were injected with T4 (hyper) and euthanized \non day 19, 20 of gestation (G19 and G20), and day 2 of lactation \n(L2). Placenta and milk immune cells (CD45+, CD3+, CD11b/c+) \nwere analyzed by flow cytometry, and mRNA hormone receptors \nand cytokines by qPCR. Histological analysis of the mammary gland \nwas performed. We observed that fetuses of hyper group (hyper) \nweighed more in G19 and G20 ( p<0.01 p<0,001 ) compared to con -\ntrols /Co). In placenta of hyper we showed a decrease in \u03b22 thyroid \nreceptor expression ( p<0.05 ) in G19 with an increase in prolactin re -\nceptor expression on G20 ( p<0.05 ). Furthermore, in hyper prolactin \nreceptor, progesterone receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and VEGF \nexpression were higher in G20 vs G19 ( p<0,05 p<0,01 p<0,05 ). On \nG19, the percentage and absolute count of placental leukocytes \nwere higher in hyper ( p<0.05 ) vs Co. In Co, on G20, we showed an \nincrease in leukocyte infiltration compared with G19 ( p<0.01 ), how -\never, we did not observe this in hyper. On lactation, the hyper off -\nspring presented lower weight on days 1 and 2 ( p<0,001 ). In L2, milk \nhad an increase in the percentage of CD45+ cells in hyper ( p<0,05 ). \nIn addition, CD3+ cells/ \u00b5l increased respect to the Co while the \nnumber of CD11 b/c+ cells/ \u00b5l diminished ( p<0,05 ). In the hyper, \nthe alveolar area and mammary adipose tissue were lower while \nmammary connective tissue was higher than Co. These results sug -\ngest that immunity may accompany alterations in fetal growth and \nin placental hormonal receptors expression at the end of pregnancy \ninduced by HP. However, their relationship with preterm birth and \nearly lactation impairment needs to be addressed. Placenta and milk \nleukocytes would be impacted by HP.\n534.

Chol is es -\nsential for testosterone synthesis and spermatogenesis, and must \nbe maintained in an optimal range for proper functioning of the tes -\ntes. Rabbits on a high-fat diet (HFD) exhibit hypercholesterolemia \nassociated with poor seminal quality, related to cholesterol overload \nin seminiferous tubule cells. Sterol regulatory element-binding pro -\ntein (SREBP)-2 governs the cholesterol pathway in testis and it is \nsensitive to dietary lipids. We have previously seen that Extra Vir -\ngin Olive Oil (EVOO) supplementation improved semen parameters \naffected by high fat diet. The aim of this study was to explore the \neffects of EVOO supplementation to HFD on rabbit testes at the \nmolecular level, analyzing the SREBP-2 pathway. Male New Zea -\nland White rabbits were fed commercial rabbit pellet (normocholes -MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021240\nterolemic rabbits: NCR), a high-fat diet (plus 14% bovine grease, \nhypercholesterolemic rabbits, HCR), or 7% bovine grease plus 7% \nEVOO (HCR + EVOO). Serum lipid levels, body weight and seminal \nparameters were measured, and mRNA and protein levels of the \nSREBP-2 pathway were assessed by PCR, Western blotting and \nimmunofluorescence. At 12 months of diet, HCR rabbits show un -\nexpected increase in the expression of SREBP 2 and downstream \nmolecules of the pathway: HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-co -\nenzyme A reductase) and LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor). \nInterestingly, the addition of EVOO showed a recovery in the ex -\npression of the mentioned proteins. In addition, preliminary studies \nof SREBP-2 regulatory molecule, INSIG1 (Insulin induced gene 1), \nand the molecule responsible for the esterification of cholesterol, \nSOAT2 (Sterol O-Acyltransferase 2), showed no significant changes \nbetween diets so far. The data showed that dietary supplementation \nwith EVOO promoted testicular improvements by modifying the ex -\npression of cholesterol pathway regulated by SREBP2.\n535. (160) PREVALENCE AND ASSOCIATION OF CHLAMYDIA \nTRACHOMATIS , UREAPLASMA SPP.

Urogenital infections are known causes of infertility. In fact, \ninfertility have been associated to Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), \nUreaplasma spp. (Uu) and Mycoplasma hominis (Mh) urogenital \ninfections. However, evidence from large studies assessing their \nprevalence and putative associations in patients with infertility is still \nscarce. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence and associa -\ntions of Ct, Uu and Mh infection in women and men seeking care \nfor infertility. A cohort of 5464 patients with a diagnosis of couple\u2019s \nprimary infertility and 404 control individuals were enrolled. Cervi -\ncal-swab and semen samples were collected from female and male \nindividuals, respectively, and infections assessed by PCR or culture. \nAssociation between infections and demographic were analysed by \nChi-square test. The prevalence of Ct, Uu and Mh urogenital infec -\ntion was significantly higher in patients than in control individuals \n(5.3%, 22.8% and 7.4% versus 2.0%, 17.8% and 1.7%, respective -\nly). Ct infection was more prevalent in male than in female patients \n(OR=1.36, p=0.034 ), being males younger than 25 years at the \nhighest risk (OR=2.51, p=0.002 ). Conversely, Uu and Mh infections \nwere more prevalent in female patients, since males were less like -\nly at risk of Uu (OR=0.52, p<0.001 ) and Mh (OR=0.41, p<0.001 ) \ninfection. In addition, Uu infection was more prevalent in patients \nyounger than 25 years, either in women (OR=2.27, p=0.003) or men \n(OR=1.66, p=0.034 ). Finally, a significant association between Mh \nand Uu infections was found in either female (OR=33.84, p<0.0001 ) \nor male (OR=71.83, p<0.0001 ) patients. Our data revealed that Ct, \nUu and Mh are prevalent uropathogens in patients with couple\u2019s \nprimary infertility and the importance of including the screening of \nurogenital infections in the diagnostic work up of infertility.\n536. (161) DO SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED PATHOGENS PLAY \nA ROLE IN MALE INFERTILITY?\nDaniela Andrea Paira1, Andrea Daniela Tissera2, Rosa Isa -\nbel Molina2, Jos\u00e9 Javier Olmedo3, Hector Alex Saka1, Rub\u00e9n \nDario Motrich1\n1 CIBICI-CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas, Univer -\nsidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina.\n2 Laboratorio de Androlog\u00eda y Reproducci\u00f3n (LAR), C\u00f3rdoba, \nArgentina.\n3 Fundaci\u00f3n Urol\u00f3gica C\u00f3rdoba para la Docencia e Investiga -\nci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica (FUCDIM), C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina.Male urogenital infection/inflammation has been proposed as re -\nsponsible for up to 15% of male infertility cases. In fact, several mi -\ncroorganisms including Ureaplasma spp.  (UU) , Mycoplasma homi -\nnis (MH)  and Chlamydia trachomatis  (CT) have been associated to \ninfertility. However, compelling evidence from large studies about \nthe role of these infections on male infertility is currently lacking. \nHerein, we studied the prevalence of UU, MH and CT infections and \ntheir impact on semen quality in a cohort of 3484 male partners of \ninfertile couples. Semen specimens were collected by masturbation \nand semen analysis assessed according to the WHO guidelines. \nInfections were analysed by PCR or culture. Chi-square and Kru -\nskal-Wallis tests were used to test infection associations. A prev -\nalence of UU, MH and CT infection of 18.8%, 4.34%, and 4.05% \nwas found, respectively. A single infection was detected in 18.5% \nof patients, whereas the simultaneous presence of two and the \nthree uropathogens was detected in 4.6% of patients. A significant \nassociation between MH and UU infections was found (OR=39.64, \np<0.0001 ). On the other hand, MH or CT infected patients showed \nreduced sperm concentration ( p<0.05 ), lower sperm viability \n(p<0.05 ), and decreased counts of morphologically normal sperm \n(p<0.001 ), with respect to non-infected patients. Moreover, CT and \nUU infected patients revealed significantly increased leukocyte \ncounts in semen ( p<0.05 ). Our results describe for the first time the \nprevalence of three common urogenital infections in male partners \nof infertile couples from Argentina, which are similar to those already \nreported worldwide. Moreover, our data indicate that MH and UU \ninfections are mutual risk factors of their co-infection. In addition, MH \nand CT infections were associated with alterations in some sperm \nquality parameters. Altogether, our results point out the relevance \nof including the screening of urogenital infections in the diagnostic \nworkup of male infertility.\n537.

Se -\nmen samples were collected by masturbation and semen analysis \nperformed according to the WHO manual. Infections by CT; Human \nPapiloma Virus; Mycoplasma hominis (MH); Herpes Simplex Virus \ntype 1 and type 2 (HSV2); Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU); Tricho -\nmona vaginalis ; Mycoplasma genitalium (MG); Treponema pallidum  \nand Neisseria gonorrhoeae were assessed by PCR. Semen qual -\nity parameters, ROS, inflammatory cytokines, subpopulations of \nleukocytes were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed by \nKruskal-Wallis test. A prevalence of CT, UU, MH and MG infection \nof 33.6%, 18.0%, 10.0% and 7.2% was found, respectively. Other \npathogens showed to be much less prevalence. Patients infected \nwith CT alone or co-infected with HSV2 showed neither significant \nalterations in most of the sperm quality parameters analyzed nor \nincreased inflammatory biomarkers in semen (p\u02c30.05). Noteworthy, \nCT-infection was associated with significantly reduced levels of ROS \nin semen (p<0.05). On the contrary, patients co-infected with CT and \nMG showed a significant reduced levels of sperm viability (p<0.05) \nand increased frequencies of necrotic sperm (p<0.001), not associ -ABSTRACTS241\nated to leukocytospermia. Our results revealed a high prevalence of \nCT-infection in young men from our region. Although, CT infection \ndoes not significantly impair sperm quality, men would provide a res -\nervoir for continuous transmission of the infection. \n538.

The aim was to study the modifications in redox markers in \nhuman follicular fluid and to investigate their behavior according to \nthe number of oocytes recovered. Sixty-four infertile women aged \nbetween 23-44 years were categorized in terms of the number of \noocytes retrieved as (A)lower: 0\u20134 oocytes, (B)intermediate: 5\u20138 \noocytes and (C)higher: \u22659 oocytes. We determined, by spectropho -\ntometric methods, a) oxidative stress markers: concentrations of \nmalondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite (NO2-); b) antioxidant defenses: \nglutathione (GSH) concentration and antioxidant enzyme: superox -\nide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx). \nStatistical analyses were performed by InfoStat software and were \nconsidered significant at p<0,05. MDA and NO2- levels were similar \nbetween groups studied. However, GSH and GPx values were sig -\nnificantly lower in the higher oocyte retrieval group compared to the \nother groups [GPx \u00b5mol/mg prot: A=25,7(14,8-39,5); B=27,3(15,6-\n38,5); C=9,9(5,8-16,4)-GSH \u00b5mol/mg prot: A=19,5(11,4-45,3); \nB=15,6(12,9-19,6); C=9,5(7,5-13,2)]. Positive IVF outcomes were \nhighest when oocyte retrieval was in the range of 5\u20138 (with pregnan -\ncy rate 23%) compared to 0\u20134 and >9 oocytes groups (with preg -\nnancy rate 10%). These findings show the behavior of the redox \nstate in the follicular environment according to the number of oo -\ncytes recovered, evidencing a marked imbalance in the group with \nthe greatest recovery of oocytes which could affect the IVF outcome.\n539.

However, the contribution of each ATP generating path -\nway to sustain the capacitation-associated changes remains un -\nclear. Based on this, we investigated the role of mitochondrial ac -\ntivity in the acquisition of sperm fertilizing ability during capacitation \nin mice. Previously we had shown, that mitochondrial membrane \npotential (MMP) increases during mouse sperm capacitation and \nthat mitochondrial activity could be associated with the maintenance \nof sperm motility during this process. Also, we had demonstrat -\ned that the MMP rise was prevented when sperm were exposed \nduring capacitation to the mitochondrial uncoupler Carbonyl cyanide \nm-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP) or the protein kinase A (PKA) in -\nhibitor H89. In the present study we demonstrated by western blot \nthat treatment with CCCP during capacitation did not affect the PKA \nsubstrate and tyrosine phosphorylations (n=3; p>0.05) but produced \na decrease in hyperactivation measured by CASA, similar to that \nobserved after H89 exposure (n>3; p<0.01). In addition, CCCP in -\nhibited the in vitro sperm fertilization capacity when sperm were in -\ncubated with cumulus-oocyte complexes (n=4; p<0.05) or with zona \npellucida  (ZP) intact eggs (n=5; p<0.05) without affecting gamete fusion (n= 4; p>0.05) and cumulus penetration (n=6; p>0.05), indi -\ncating that hyperactivation supported by mitochondrial function is \nnecessary for penetration of the ZP. Finally, complementary in vivo \nfertilization experiments further demonstrated the fundamental role \nof mitochondrial activity for sperm function (n>4; p<0.05). Altogether, \nour results show the physiological relevance of mitochondrial func -\ntionality for sperm fertilization competence.\n540.

Tb CM also \ninhibited the expression of proinflammatory markers such as CD86 \nafter 18h of stimulation with LPS. 18 h stimulation with LPS induced \nlipid droplet accumulation in CD14+ cells, while Tb CM reduced lipid \nstorage. Moreover, LPS induced the release of lactate and CM par -\ntially inhibited this effect. \nOur preliminary findings indicate that Tb-derived factors induce met -\nabolic reprogramming of CD14+ cells associated to inhibition of a \nproinflammatory phenotype.\n541.

The data were analyzed through ANOVA \nwith Duncan post-test to contrast the evaluated structures of the ex -\nperimental model and C group, and T-student test for sCOD and C \ngroup. The number of CD14+, CD2+ and CD79+ cells was higher in \novarian cortex, medulla, theca interna and externa of C group than \nin sCOD, P0, P10 and P15 groups (p<0.05). Exceptionally, CD79+ \ncells in the ovarian cortex of the P0 group were similar respect to the \nC group (p>0.05). Because these populations constitute potential in \nsitu modulators of ovarian function, acting through the secretion of \nregulatory factors of the inflammatory process related to ovulation, \nwe propose that this low proportion of these cells could be partly \nresponsible for the anovulation observed in COD.\n542.

We optimized \nan alternative method for cfRNAs isolation using TRIzol reagent. \nPlasma and urine samples from 18 to 40-year-old women were \nused. Some of them were obtained from pregnant women (during \nthe first, second and third trimester) and others from non-pregnant \nwomen. Plasma samples were obtained by venipuncture in ethylene \ndiamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes. All samples were centrifuged \nat high revolutions to remove cell debris and cfRNAs were isolated \nfrom supernatants using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Several vol -\numes were assayed: 150, 250, 400 and 600 \u00b5L. Then, cfRNAs were \nconverted to cDNA by retrotranscription (RT) using Moloney murine \nleukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The ribosomal pro -\ntein L19 (L19) cfRNA was analyzed by real time quantitative PCR. \nSeveral cDNA dilutions were assayed: 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8. Amplification \nproducts were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. cfR -\nNAs were purified in all volumes assayed, except in 150 \u00b5L plasma \nsamples due to aqueous phase absence. cfRNAs concentrations \nwere from 10.9 to 158.5 ng/\u00b5L. RT was carried out using 0.2-1 \u00b5g \nRNA. The L19 target was amplified in all samples using 5 \u00b5L cDNA. \nFurthermore, Cts values obtained demonstrated amplification pro -\ngression in cDNA successive dilutions assayed, with low standard \ndeviation between duplicates (difference <0.5). Similar results were \nobtained using pregnant and non-pregnant women samples. Our re -\nsults suggest that cfRNAs isolation using TRIzol reagent could be a \nsuitable method compared to commercial kits for specific analysis of these molecules on plasma and urine samples.\n543.

In the human ovary, ACE-2 is expressed \nin stromal and granulosa cells. \nOur objective was to evaluate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection \non female gonad. \nFF (follicular fluid) from patients undergoing ART (n= 80; 21\u201341 \nyears old; November 2020-April 2021) were divided in two groups: \nFF from control patients and FF from recovered COVID-19 patients \n(asymptomatic and with mild symptoms). \nThe levels of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, IL-1 \u03b2, IL-10 and \nVEGF were measured in FF by ELISA. \nUsing a granulosa cell line (COV434) and an endothelial cell line \n(EA.hy926), we studied the effect of FF from control and recov -\nered COVID-19 patients. The expression of StAR, ER\u03b1 and ER \u03b2, \n3\u03b2-HSD, VEGF, ANGPTs (angiogenesis-related proteins) and \n\u03b3H2AX (DNA damage marker) was evaluated by WB. Proliferation \nwas evaluated by a WST-1 assay. Endothelial cell migration was \nevaluated by a wound healing assay. We performed Student\u2019s t test \nor one-way ANOVA.\nThe results showed that 91.3% of post-COVID-19 FF was positive \nfor IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Patients with higher levels of SARS-\nCoV-2 IgG showed a decrease in the number of retrieved oocytes \n(p<0.05). The levels of VEGF and IL-1 \u03b2 were lower (p<0.05) in post-COVID-19 FF, while IL-10 did not differ.\nIn COV434 cells with post-COVID-19 FF, the expression of StAR, \nEr\u03b2 and VEGF was decreased (p<0.05), while ER \u03b1 and 3 \u03b2-HSD \ndid not change.\nIn EA.hy926 cells with post-COVID-19 FF, a decrease in cell migra -\ntion was observed (p<0.0001) without changes in the expression of \nANGPTs. Both cell types showed higher expression of \u03b3H2AX with \npost-COVID-19 FF (p<0.05).

It is characterized by the growth \nof endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity and often caus -\nes chronic pelvic pain and subfertility. Currently, EDT has no cure, \nand there is an unmet need for new treatment options. Angiogenesis \nis essential for the growth of endometriotic implants because it en -\nsures an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients and the removal \nof waste products. Elevated copper (Cu) levels have been linked to \nEDT. Cu is required by many enzymes, some involved in the anti -\noxidant system. In cancer, this metal promotes angiogenesis, tumor \nprogression, and oxidative stress. Therefore, our objective was to \nevaluate the effect of Cu chelation with ammonium tetrathiomo -\nlybdate (TM) on angiogenesis and oxidative stress in endometriot -\nic-like lesions. Sixteen female C57BL/6 mice were divided into two \nexperimental groups: EDT and EDT+TM. The EDT induction was \nperformed by autologous uterine tissue transplantation to the intes -\ntinal mesentery. The EDT+TM group received 0.30 mg of TM/day \nin their drinking water for two weeks from the postoperative 15th \nday. Bodyweight and hematocrit were periodically monitored. En -\ndometriotic-like lesions were collected one month after the pathol -\nogy was induced to analyze the expression of angiogenic markers \n(RTqPCR), the presence of endothelial cells (immunofluorescence), \nand oxidative stress (spectrophotometric methods). Treatment with \nTM induced anti-angiogenic effects by decreasing the number of \nblood vessels (p<0.001), the mRNA expression of Fgf2 and Pdgfb  \n(p<0.05), and the presence of endothelial cells (p<0.001). Besides, \nit decreased antioxidant activity (SOD and CAT, p<0.05) and in -\ncreased lipid peroxidation (TBARS, p<0.05). In conclusion, TM acts \nas an effective anti-angiogenic agent and modulates the oxidative \nimbalance in EDT. These observations support the study of TM as a \npossible non-hormonal treatment for EDT.\n547.

Porphyromonas  gingivalis (Pg)  is among the most relevant \npathogens in periodontal disease. Pg produces and releases outer \nmembrane vesicles (OMVs).  The production of OMVs is involved in \nbacterial functions and has a role in pathogenesis. During placen -\ntation, trophoblast cells secrete cytokines and chemokines in order \nto interact with immune cells and maintain immune homeostasis. Al -\nterations in this interaction associate with pregnancy complications. \nIn this work, we analyzed the effect of Pg-OMVs on trophoblast cell \nfunction. \nOMV were isolated by ultracentrifugation and labelled with PKH26 \ndye for uptake assays. OMVs were characterized using dynamic \nlight scattering and transmission electron microscopy and were on \nthe nanometric size range (108 \u00b139 nm). Swan-71 and HTR-8 tro -\nphoblast cells were treated with 0.1-10 ug/ml Pg-OMV for 2-24h de -\npending on the assay. MTT assay was used to evaluate cell viability. \nTo test trophoblast\u2013monocyte interaction, monocytes were isolated \nfrom healthy volunteers using Percoll gradient and incubated with \ntrophoblast conditioned media (Tb-CM). \nWe found that Pg-OMVs were internalized by HTR-8 and Swan-71 \ntrophoblast cells in a time and concentration dependent manner \nwithout affecting cell viability. Inhibition of actin polymerization by \ncytochalasin D reduced the uptake of Pg-OMVs. Regarding immune \nhomeostasis maintenance, increased mRNA expression of IL-1beta, \nMCP-1, RANTES was found in Pg-OMV treated trophoblast cells. In \naddition, Tb-CM of Pg-OMV treated cells decreased the frequency \nof IL-10 + CD14+ monocytes (p<0,05).\nResults are consistent with a mechanism of Pg-OMVs to affect tro -\nphoblast cell cytokine profile and trophoblast-immune interaction \nthat might impair placentation and contribute to adverse pregnancy \noutcome.\n548.

Alterations in these processes are associated with pathol -\nogies such as preeclampsia and placenta accreta spectrum. KLF6 \nis a transcription factor highly expressed in placenta and required \nfor proper placental development. KLF6 immunoreactivity is higher \nin the placental bed of preeclamptic than in that of uncomplicated \npregnancies. Its expression is regulated by hypoxia and inducers \nof oxidative stress. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) modulate es -\nsential physiological processes but can lead to oxidative or reduc -\ntive damage. We have demonstrated that KLF6 silencing increases \nROS level and EVT cell migration. We hypothesize that KLF6 modu -\nlates EVT differentiation through ROS. Herein, we demonstrate that ROS induced upon KLF6 downregulation is not associated with cell \ndamage, based on Anexin V/7-AAD and MTT assays. Cell prolif -\neration, measured by BrdU uptake, is reduced and correlates with \nan increase in p21 expression. In addition, the decrease in KLF6 \nlevels increase metalloproteinase 9 activity and the expression of \nmolecules involved in cell migration, promotes the translocation of \n\u03b2-catenin to the nucleus, measured by confocal microscopy, and \nincreases polarized cell migration evaluated by orientation of the \nmicrotubule organizing center. Furthermore, KLF6-silenced cells \nacquire a more fibroblastic phenotype and treatment with two anti -\noxidants, NAC and tempol, partially recovers cell morphology. In line \nwith the data obtained in vitro, placenta accretas, characterized by \nbeing abnormally invasive, have lower KLF6 immunostaining levels. \nAltogether these results suggest that KLF6 modulates EVT differ -\nentiation through the regulation of ROS levels and suggest that its \ndysregulation may contribute to the development of pregnancy pa -\nthologies like placenta accreta spectrum and preeclampsia.\n549.

However, the effects of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) on the \ncomplexity of this inflammatory response are not yet well described. \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ACTH during \npreovulatory period on the number of mononuclear cells (MCs) in -\nfiltrated in the ovary and on the mechanisms associated with cell \ninfiltration. ACTH (100 IU) was administered to Holstein cows (n=11) \nduring proestrus every 12 h for four days before ovulation when ova -\nriectomy was performed (day 18). Daily ovarian Doppler ultrasonog -\nraphy was used to evaluate the percentage of irrigated area (IA), the \npulsatility and resistance index on the dominant follicles. Also, blood \nsample was taken on day 18 to analyze alterations on circulating \nMCs using an hematology analyzer. Macrophages (CD14), T (CD2) \nand B (CD79) lymphocytes distribution in ovary was analyzed by \nimmunohistochemistry. In follicular wall samples, gene expression \nof chemokines MCP1, IL8, CXCL1, CCL25 were evaluated. And, \nIL17a expression was analyzed by western blot. A Generalized Lin -\near Model was used to analyze the results. The number of systemic \nmonocytes and lymphocytes were similar between groups (p>0.05). \nHowever, the total number of CD14, CD79 and CD2 infiltrated cells \nwere lower in ACTH group than in control group (p<0.05). The IA \nshowed to be higher on day 18 than in day 16 and 17 (p<0.05) \nbut no effects of treatment (T) or interaction (T x time) was found \n(p>0.05). Chemokine\u2019s gene expression showed a lower mRNA \nof CCL25 on ACTH group (p<0.05). IL17a protein expression was \nsimilar between groups (p>0.05). Our results suggest that ACTH, \nreleased as consequence of stress in preovulatory period, could im -\npair MCs infiltration in bovine ovary and this could be due to a lower \nchemotaxis capacity of the ovary.\n550.

Both cell models \nwere treated with CoCl2 (50,100 or  250 \u00b5M) in presence or absence \nof leptin (100 ng/ml).  We studied the MAPK signaling pathway after \nhypoxia treatment, using  pharmacological inhibitors. The expression \nof Bid, Bad, Bax, Caspase 9 and Caspase 3 was determined by \nWestern blot and qRT-PCR. Leptin diminishes Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (0.2 \n\u00b1 0.1) in Swan-71 cells, under hypoxia condition; determinate by \nqRT-PCR and WB. Leptin treatment in hypoxia condition, regulates \nanti and proapoptotic proteins, decreasing t-Bid (0.5 \u00b1 0.4); Bax (0.8 \n\u00b10.1), Bid (1.3 \u00b1 0.09) and enhance Bcl-2\n(2.0\u00b1 0.3), Bcl-XL (2.3 \u00b1 0.3). Apoptosis was determined analyzed  \nby DNA ladder assay in  placental explants. All these results  suggest \nthat Leptin  is capable to protect, placental apoptosis after  HIF-1\u03b1 \nstabilization.\n551. (415) THE IMPACT OF OVARIAN FOAMY MACROPHAGES \nON THE REPRODUCTIVE AGING OF VIP KNOCK OUT MICE\nLucila Gallino1, Vanesa Hauk1, Esteban Grasso1, Fatima Me -\nrech1, Lara Castagnola1, Ana Schafir1, Natalia Pascuali2, Fer-\nnanda Parborell2 ,  Maria May3 , James Waschek4, Claudia \nPerez Leir\u00f3s1 and Rosanna Ramhorst1\n1 IQUIBICEN, University of Buenos Aires, CONICET, Argen -\ntina.\n2 Estudios de la Fisiopatolog\u00eda del ovario, IBYME, CONICET, \nArgentina.\n3 ININFA, Universidad de Buenos Aires, CONICET, Argentina \n4 The David Geffen School of Medicine, University of Califor -\nnia, Los Angeles, USA\nBackground: Reproductive aging is proposed to be associated with \na chronic low-grade systemic inflammation (inflammaging), a dys -\nfunction of immune tolerance with a detrimental impact on pregnan -\ncy. Since, VIP is an immunopeptide found in the reproductive tract \nwith antiinflammatory effects inducing a tolerogenic response, we \naim to understand VIP contribution to control inflammaging in order \nto prevent premature aging, particularly in the ovary.\nMethods:  Animals used: VIP Knockout KO (-/-), deficient HT (+/-\n) and wild type WT (+/+) 3 or 8 months old in estrus. The serum \nhormones were measured with immulite Xpi Siemens platform. The \novaries were examined after histological staining and IL-1\u03b2 secre -\ntion measured by ELISA. Phagocytosis assays of apoptotic bodies \nwere monitored using light microscopy analysis to obtain foamy \nmacrophages. Lipid droplets were stained with BODIPY and quanti -\nfied by FACS analysis. \nResults: We confirmed that during reproductive aging WT females \ngain weight, show cycling disorders with lighter ovaries accompa -\nnied by altered levels of ovarian hormones in serum. These param -\neters were found to be exacerbated in young VIP KO mice behaving \nas WT animals of advanced reproductive age. Moreover, young \nVIP KO mice displayed an inflammatory ovarian microenvironment \nwith increased IL-1\u03b2 production (p<0.05 Two Way ANOVA) and the \npresence foamy macrophages, linked to premature aging. We also \nfound histological differences between the ovaries with more sec -\nondary follicles, less corpora lutea and more atretic follicles (p<0.05 \nTwo Way ANOVA) indicating ovarian failure. Next, peritoneal mac -\nrophages were obtained from WT mice and cultured with apoptot -\nic thymocytes +/- VIP antagonist during different time points. Lipid droplets in the macrophage cytoplasm were increased in the pres -\nence of VIP antagonist after 72 h of phagocytosis.\nConclusion: VIP may contribute to control the inflammatory milieu of \nthe aging ovary preventing foamy macrophage generation.\n552.

Buenos Aires, Argentina. 2 Fertilis Medicina \nReproductiva. Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nObjectives: Endometrial stromal cells undergo an acute senescence \nresponse as well as endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) during de -\ncidual differentiation. Here, we focus on the link between both pro -\ncesses to support embryo implantation.\nMaterials and methods: Human endometrial stromal cell line \n(HESC) was decidualized with MPA and db-cAMP for 8 days (Dec). \nTo induce ERS, non-decidualized (nonDec) cells were stimulated \nwith 1ug/ml of thapsigargin (Tg) for 4h. Public data of genome-wide \ntranscriptome analysis of primary ESCs (GSE160702) was used to \nevaluate expression of senescence-associated genes Deiodinase 2 \n(DIO2), Lumican (LUM), Ferritin (FTL) and Forkhead box protein O1 \n(FOXO1). Gene expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR in HESC \ncells and in endometrial biopsies from fertile women and recurrent \nimplantation failure (RIF) patients. FOXO1 and \u03b2-galactosidase ac -\ntivity were tested by FACS. *p<0.05 was considered significant.\nResults: \u03b2-galactosidase activity was quantified in HESC cells \nthroughout the decidualization, displaying a peak during the first \ndays of the process. Senescence-associated genes expression \nshowed a downregulation of DIO2 and an upregulation of FTL, \nLUM* and FOXO1* in Dec cells (vs nonDec). Results were in accor -\ndance with in silico  transcriptome analysis of primary ESC. FOXO1 \nincreased was also confirmed at protein level by FACS. Then, HESC \ncells were stimulated with Tg, a strong ERS inducer, showing a sim -\nilar expression pattern. Finally, RIF biopsies showed a downregula -\ntion of DIO2* while FTL* was upregulated (vs fertile controls).\nConclusion: HESC cells in vitro  model depicted a similar senes -\ncence response that in primary cultures. Additionally, this was mod -\nulated by ERS induction, indicating a link between both processes. \nThis was also observed in RIF patients, which we have previously \nreported to show an altered ERS response in addition to the altered \nsenescence response observed here, and that might be related to \nendometrial receptivity failure.\n553. (440) GESTATIONAL TREATMENT OF BUTYRATE MODU -\nLATES MATERNAL AND FETAL LIPID METABOLISM IN A \nRAT MODEL OF MATERNAL OVERWEIGHT\nFlorencia Heinecke, Cintia Gatti, Evangelina Capobianco, \nAlicia Jawerbaum, Ver\u00f3nica White\nIn a rat model of maternal overweight we described in mothers, hy -\npertriglyceridemia and in fetuses, overgrowth and liver lipid overac -\ncumulation. Fetal alterations persisted in the offspring that develop \nfatty liver disease. Butyrate (B), a product of fiber metabolism from \nintestinal microbiota, improves lipid metabolism and prevents in -\nflammation. Maternal oral administration of B prevented maternal \nhypertriglyceridemia, fetal overgrowth and liver lipid overaccumula -\ntion.\nOur aim was to clarify the effects of B on lipid metabolism that \nhelped to prevent maternal and fetal alterations.\nMethods:  Female Wistar rats were fed standard (CT rats) or sat -\nurated fat-rich-diet (FD rats) for 8 weeks and mated with control \nmales. Vehicle or B (3%) was orally delivered daily during gestation \n(FDB rats). At gestational day 21, all rats were euthanized. Fetuses, \nmaternal and fetal liver were explanted and weighed. Maternal liver \nlevels of triglycerides (TG) were assessed by TLC, mRNA levels \nof enzymes involved in lipid metabolism by RT-qPCR and alanine \naminotransferase (ALT) circulating activity by EIA.MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021246\nResults:  Maternal livers showed TG overaccumulation in FD rats \n(300% p>0.01 vs CT) which persisted in FDB rats. Maternal hepatic \nmRNA levels of Aco and Cpt-1  were decreased (30%p>0.05 vs CT) \nin FD and FDB rats, while Srebp-1c  mRNA levels were increased \nin FDB rats (40% p>0.05 vs CT). Fetal hepatic mRNA levels of Lpl \nand Srebp-1c  were increased (70% p>0.05 vs CT) in FD, while B \nprevented the increase in Srebp-1c  in female fetuses (60% p>0.05 \nvs FD). FD fetuses showed an increase in ALT activity (30% p>0.05 \nvs CT), which was prevented by B (20% p>0.05 vs FD).\nConclusions:  Butyrate increased the already FD-induced maternal \nliver lipid overaccumulation. A decrease in lipid oxidation enzymes \nand an increase in Srebp-1c expression may be involved in maternal \neffects, while in fetuses, prevention of overgrowth, liver lipid over -\naccumulation and damage may involve sex dependent pathways.\n554.

Instituto de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica de la Fa -\ncultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (IQUIBICEN), CONI -\nCET-Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina\nObjective:  Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associated \nto an increased risk of fetal growth  impairment and altered central \nnervous system development. We have previously  demonstrated \nthat ZIKV impaired trophoblast cell (Tb) migration, increased glu -\ncose  uptake and decreased the brain derived neurotrophic factor \n(BDNF) expression.  Up to date there is no treatment or vaccines to  \nameliorate the observed fetal growth defects. We previously demon -\nstrated that the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) not only favors \nimmune homeostasis maintenance but modulates trophoblast cell \ninvasion and metabolism at early pregnancy. Our aim is to elucidate \nthe metabolism and signaling pathways altered by ZIKV in first-tri -\nmester human Tb cells and explore the potential antiviral effect of \nthe endogenous polypeptide VIP. Material and Methods:  We infect -\ned first-trimester Tb-derived cell line Swan-71 with an isolated local \nZIKV strain in the presence/absence of VIP. Tb migration was as -\nsessed in wound healing assays, RNA expression by RT- qPCR and \nviral production by the lysis plaque assay. Results:  ZIKV induces an \nincrease of NFKB and the proapoptotic  factor BAK mRNA expres -\nsion. However, a significantly higher increment in the anti-apoptot -\nic factor BCL-2 was detected (2.5-fold increase of BCL-2 vs BAK \np<0.01). Tb cells  infected in the presence of VIP showed significant -\nly lower levels of viral particles production (n=4; p<0.01) accompa -\nnied by a decrease in  viral RNA detection in Tb cells. Interestingly, \nVIP induced higher  levels of BST-2 expression, an IFN-induced cell \nmembrane protein involved  in the impairment of virion release and \nviral cell-to-cell transmission  (Z vs. VIP-Z; p<0.05). Moreover, VIP \nameliorated the impairment of  cell migration induced by ZIKV (n=4; \np<0.05).\nConclusion:  We propose VIP  as a potential antiviral endogenous \nfactor since it reduces the permissively of the cells to Zika infection \nand ameliorates Tb migration impairment.\n555.

Instituto de Qu\u00edmica \nBiol\u00f3gica de la Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales \n(IQUIBICEN), CONICET-Universidad de Buenos Aires, Bue -\nnos Aires, Argentina\nObjective: Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associ -\nated to fetal growth impairment and altered central nervous system \ndevelopment. Up to date, there is no treatment or vaccines to ame-\nliorate fetal growth defects. We previously demonstrated that the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) modulates trophoblast cell (Tb) \nfunction and metabolism at early pregnancy. Our aim is to determine \nthe metabolism and signaling pathways altered by ZIKV in first-tri -\nmester human Tb cells, the impact on the Tb-immune cell interac -\ntion and the potential antiviral effect of VIP. Material and Methods: \nFirst-trimester Tb-derived cell line Swan-71 was infected with an iso -\nlated local ZIKV strain with/without VIP. Tb migration was assessed \nin wound healing assays and RNA expression by RT- qPCR. PBMC \nfrom healthy volunteers were conditioned with media (CM) from \nTb-infected cells to analyze migration and functional profile. Re-\nsults: ZIKV impaired Tb migration and decreased the expression of \nthe neurotrophic factor BDNF. CM of Tb infected cells increased the \nrecruitment of monocytes, CD4+ and NK cells and modified the acti -\nvation profile of CD14+ cells favoring immune homeostasis mainte -\nnance. ZIKV infection increased Tb glucose uptake and modulated \nthe signaling pathway of retinol inducing RIG-1 and RAR-alpha ex -\npression while a decrease of RAR-beta was detected. Interestingly, \nTb cells infected in the presence of VIP produced lower infectious \nviral particles (p<0.01) along with a decrease of viral RNA in Tb cells. \nMoreover, VIP ameliorated ZIKV effect on Tb migration (p<0.05). \nConclusion: Zika viral infection might impact early pregnancy by \naffecting Tb function, altering Tb metabolism and modulating Tb-leu -\nkocyte interaction thus sustaining Tb survival and virus persistence \nin the placenta. VIP emerges as a potential antiviral candidate to \nreduce the impact of  ZIKV placental infection at early pregnancy \nsince it decreases ZIKV propagation and restores Tb cell migration.\n556.

It is known that sperm reaches their maturity \nin epididymis and then are capable of fecundation in female tract \nafter a series of changes such like capacitation, hypermotility and \nacrosomal reaction.\nObjectives: analyse the PEDF expression in male tract and its ef -\nfect over mouse sperm capacitation by the addition of recombinant \nPEDF (rPEDF) to the media.\nMaterial and methods: mice C57/bl6 were sacrificed, testis and \nepididymis were removed and cauda sperms and tissues were ob -\ntained. We detected the presence of PEDF in mice reproductive \ntract by immunocytochemistry and over the sperm cells by immune \nfluorescence. Capacitation assays were performed. Briefly, sperm \nwere pre incubated with rPEDF in two different concentrations: 50 \nand 100 ng/ml for 20 minutes in capacitating and non-capacitating \nmedia (HMB/HM). After 80 minutes, the acrosomal reaction was \nevaluated by Coomasie blue stain and was observed in microscope \nNikon 80i. We counted 200 sperm by condition and the results were \ncompare respect the non-capacitated state and the incubation in \npresence or absence of rPEDF. \nResults: PEDF was expressed in the mice reproductive tract from \ntestis to epididymis. Positive stain was observed mostly in seminif -\nerous epithelium and peritubular cells. In epididymis it was detected \nin cytoplasm of caput epididymal cells and in cauda the sign was \nmainly nuclear. The capacitation assays shown an increase in acro -\nsomal reaction (10 and 20%) due to the addition of 50 and 100 ng/\nml of rPEDF respectably (Chi square test). \nConclusion: The presence of PEDF in the murine model suggests \nthat could be involved in sperm biology in the male and inside fe -\nmale tract and contribute with the fertilization process. Further stud -\nies are needed in order to clarify PEDF role in sperm capacitation \nand or acrosomal reaction.\n557.

In order to gain fertil -\nization competence, they must undergo a series of biochemical and \nphysiological events as they travel across the female tract that are \ncollectively known as capacitation. One of the outcomes of capacita -\ntion is the ability to undergo acrosomal exocytosis, a unique secreto -\nry event. It occurs as the result of fusion events between the plasma \nmembrane and a specialized vesicle called acrosome. A commonly \nemployed method to assess acrosome exocytosis in single cell im -\naging is the use of FM dyes, which stain plasma membrane and \nit allows to follow the dynamics of this unique process. By using \nthis dye, we observed that the mouse sperm midpiece encounters a \ndecrease in diameter during the acrosome reaction induced either \nwith progesterone, ionomycin or spontaneously. The contraction is \ninitiated in any segment of the midpiece but preferentially begins \nnear the neck. In single-cell super resolution experiments, we also \nemployed Fluo4-AM and SiR-actin to monitor how intracellular cal -\ncium and actin dynamics, respectively, are involved in this process. \nWe observed that this contraction is accompanied by an increase in \nintracellular calcium and a significant change in the F-actin structure \nlocated in the midpiece. Taken together, these results demonstrate \nthat during acrosome reaction the mouse sperm midpiece goes \nthrough dynamic and structural changes that could affect the motility \npattern of fertilizing sperm.\n558.

Metabolic distur -\nbances  due to western diets in women of reproductive age lead  to \nmenstrual dysfunction, subfertility and pregnancy complications. \nHowever, it is  not clear how high fat diets (HFD) affect reproductive \nfunction.\nHypothesis:  HFD causes metabolic and reproductive alterations in \nfemale mice. Metformin  improves these effects.\nObjective:  To analyze the effects of HFD and metformin on metabo -\nlism and reproductive function in female mice.\nMethodology:  21d.o. female C57BL/6 mice were fed with HFD or \ncontrol  diet for 16 weeks. One HFD group received metformin the  \nlast four weeks. Mice were weighed once a week. Serum,  gonadal \nand visceral fat and the ovaries were extracted. Estrus  cycle, glyce -\nmia and ovarian angiogenesis were evaluated. Another set of ani -\nmals were mated with males. Offspring number, weight and the time \nuntil pregnancy were recorded. One-way- ANOVA was used.\nResults:  The HFD-mice had  higher body weight, glycemia, GTT, to -\ntal cholesterol, visceral and gonadal  adipose tissue. Metformin im -\nproved GTT and decreased adipose tissues. The  estrus cycle was \nshorter in HFD mice and the number  of cycles/14d was increased \nin the HFD group. However, anovulatory  stages were longer in HFD \nmice. Metformin had no effect  on estrous cycle. The days until preg -\nnancy were higher in  HFD group and metformin reversed this effect. We  found less pups  per litter but no differences in pups\u2019weight. \nHowever, total litter weight  was lower in HFD group. Metformin im -\nproved this parameter. Ovarian  periendothelial area was increased \nin HFD and PDGFB was decreased.  Metformin decreased periendo -\nthelial area with no effect on PDGFB.\nConclusion: HFD  affects metabolism, ovarian function, estrous cycle \nand the litter size.  Metformin improves some of these alterations. \nHFD also increases the  time to pregnancy and metformin revers -\nes this delay. Changes in  ovarian vasculature and PDGFB may be \nsome of the possible causes  of the observed alterations.\n559. (512) THE ABSENCE OF CATSPER CHANNELS AFFECTS \nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF TUBULIN IN MOUSE SPERM\nJamaica L. Schiavi-Ehrenhaus, Paula A. Balestrini, Martina \nJablo\u00f1ski, Guillermina M. Luque, Mariano G. Buffone.\nInstituto de Biolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental (IBYME), Con -\nsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CO -\nNICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nIn several cellular systems, tubulin plays an important role in  the \nregulation of ion channels. Protein extraction experiments with \nnon-ionic  detergents such as Triton X-100 showed that this tubu -\nlin is  not a structural part of the cytoskeleton, but is close  to the \nplasma membrane and accomplish its regulatory function through  \nits association/dissociation to ion channels. In mammalian sperm, \nthe presence  of tubulin outside the axoneme has not been reported. \nOur hypothesis is that there is a fraction of tubulin associated  with \nCatSper channels, fulfilling regulatory functions for the development \nof hyperactivated motility and consequently fertilizing ability.\nIn the present work, we carried out extracts of sperm proteins in \nthe presence of Triton X-100. We observed by immunoblotting that \na small portion of tubulin remains in the soluble fraction, indicating \nthat it is not part of the cytoskeleton. When we performed these ex -\nperiments on sperm derived from CatSper knockout mice (CatSper \nKO), the amount of tubulin in the soluble fraction was significant -\nly lower than in wild-type (WT) sperm. As the opening of  CatSper \noccurs in response to capacitation, we proceeded to study  if the \npartition of the soluble tubulin follows a specific  dynamic during this \nprocess in WT sperm. The levels of  tubulin in the soluble fraction \nincrease throughout the 60-min of  incubation under capacitating \nconditions. In order to investigate the localization  of this soluble tu -\nbulin, we performed super-resolution microscopy. Sperm from WT \nmice were incubated in the presence of the permeable tubulin probe  \nSPY555-tubulin and analyzed using SRRF (Super-Resolution Radi -\nal Fluctuations). Novel structures  were observed in the most distal \nregion of the flagellum  and in the head.\nTaken together, our results suggest that there is tubulin beyond the \naxoneme that presents a specific partition dynamic during sperm \ncapacitation and could play a regulatory role on CatSper channels.\n560.

For the aim i), lactating cows (n=37) were selected. Blood and \nfollicular fluid  (FF) were sampled at the time of first dominant post -\npartum follicle (1\u00baDPF; day 9\u00b12) and PF (day 45\u00b12). Cows with few-\ner postpartum days (FPPD, n=15) or more postpartum days (MPPD, \nn=22) were analyzed by a generalized linear mixed model. For aim \nii), complete ovaries of non-lactating cows (n=6) were obtained by \novariectomy. Mann-Whitney test was applied. A weak GH gene ex-\npression was found in GC thus could not be quantified. The GHR \ngene expression was higher in the FPPD group than in the MPPD on \nthe 1\u00baDPF (P<0.05). NEFA and BHBA levels (in FF and serum) were \nhigher in the MPPD  group than  in the FPPD (P <0.05). Glucose and \ninsulin concentrations  (in FF) were higher in the FPPD group than \nin the MPPD (P <0.05). The protein expression of GH was higher in \nGC than in theca interna (TC) whereas for GHR  was higher in TC \nthan GC (P<0.05). These results show a  local production of the GH-\nGHR and an earlier return to postpartum cyclicity  in cows with higher \nGHR gene expression. High levels of  BHBA and NEFA and low (in \nFF) glucose and insulin  levels in the MPPD group could generate an \nadverse microenvironment  within follicle and delay the resumption \nof postpartum ovarian activity.\n561. (545) HYPERPOLARIZATION OF THE PLASMA MEM -\nBRANE IS NECESSARY FOR MOUSE ACROSOMAL EXO -\nCYTOSIS AND SPERM MIGRATION IN VIVO\nPaula A. Balestrini1, Martina Jablo\u00f1ski1, Liza Jamaica Schia -\nvi-Ehrenhaus1, Guillermina M. Luque1, Celia Santi2, Mariano \nG. Buffone1.\n1 Laboratorio de biolog\u00eda celular y molecular de la reproducci\u00f3n, \nInstituto de Biolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental (IByME)-CONI -\nCET, CABA, Argentina. 2 Department of OB/GYN, Washington \nUniversity School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA.\nTo acquire fertilizing capacity mammalian sperm must undergo a \ncomplex process called capacitation (CAP). Among other biochem -\nical and physiological processes, hyperpolarization of the plasma \nmembrane (Em), an early event that occurs during CAP, leads up to \nacrosomal exocytosis (AE). It has been shown in mouse sperm that \nhyperpolarization of the Em is necessary and sufficient to prepare \nnon-capacitated (NC) sperm for the AE. Furthermore, in mice where \nthe sperm-specific potassium channel Slo3 has been knocked-out \n(KO), hyperpolarization of the Em doesn\u2019t take place and mice are \ninfertile. Recently we have shown in human sperm that an oscil -\nlatory intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) pattern prevents the occurrence of \nAE in NC sperm. Moreover, pharmacological hyperpolarization of \nthe plasma membrane modulates the [Ca2+]i pattern, reducing the \noscillatory [Ca2+]i increase enabling sperm to induce AE. The aim \nof this study was to evaluate the physiological role of Em hyper -\npolarization during CAP in vivo . We generated a new transgenic \nmouse by mating female Slo3 KO mice, with male transgenic mice \nwith EGFP in their acrosome and DsRed2 in the mitochondria. This \nnew Slo3 KO transgenic mice allowed us to observe the acrosomal \nstatus while sperm are migrating through the female reproductive \ntract. We performed mattings between KO or Wild Type (WT) males \nand WT female mice. First, we found that KO males mated less \nthan the WT. More interestingly, although the number of sperm in the \nuterus was similar when mated with WT or KO males, the number \nof sperm reaching the oviductal isthmus  was lower when the male \nwere KO. Surprisingly, WT and KO sperm reached the ampulla,  the \nsite of fertilization . However, unlike the WT sperm, KO sperm were \nacrosome intact. Based on these results we conclude that 1) sperm \nEm contributes to the selection of sperm that enter and colonize the \noviduct and is essential for AE in vivo; 2) the AE is not necessary for \nsperm migration to the ampulla.\n562.

Damage to sperm DNA can occur at any stage \nof this process, and this damage is a multifactorial phenomenon. \nTransferrin is the major transporter of iron (Fe) in the body. In sem -\ninal plasma (SP) is found an isoform, testicular transferrin (TfT), \nwhich is essential for spermatogenesis. The objective of this work \nwas to evaluate the relationship between TfT levels in SP and sperm \nDNA damage. Semen samples from 49 patients were studied. A ba -\nsic semen analysis was performed according to WHO guidelines \n(WHO 2010).In order to evaluate DNA damage, sperm DNA dena -\nturation  was assessed using the acridine orange test (AOT) tech -\nnique (Tejada et al., 1984) and  sperm DNA fragmentation index \nwas determined by the TUNEL test (Terminal Transferase dUTP \nNick End Labeling). The TfT concentration was quantified by radial \nimmunodiffusion (RID), whith an adapted technique. Statistical anal -\nysis was performed by the Spearman ordered rank correlation co -\nefficient (r) for TfT versus sperm DNA fragmentation index (TUNEL) \nand DNA integrity (AOT). For the index of DNA fragmentation with \nTfT levels, the results were: r = -0.7328 p <0.01. The percentage \nof sperm with denatured DNA (AOT) also showed a negative re -\nlationship with TfT concentration (r = -0.4398; p-value = 0.0055, p \n<0.01). Statistical data suggest that high levels of TfT correlate with \nless  damage DNA in spermatozoa. Future studies should include a \nlarger cohort of samples  to get closer to more accurate conclusions \nabout the relationship between spermatogenesis, TfT, a promising \nbiomarker of male infertility, and the integrity of sperm DNA, a factor \nthat is becoming increasingly important on reproductive outcomes \nsuch as fertilization, implantation, miscarriage, pregnancy, and live \nbirth rates.\n563.

However, there are cases in \nwhich these techniques fail due to idiopathic causes. In search of \npossible causes of infertility in couples, we studied the presence \nof post-translational marks on the remaining histones in human \nspermatozoa, as it has been found that they are involved in the \nfunctionality of the post-fertilization zygote and may contribute to \nembryonic development. The aim of the study was to evaluate the \nrelationship between the remaining sperm histones and the success \nof ART. In this study, the presence of modified histones was ana -\nlyzed by immunocytochemistry using antibodies against H3K4me3, \nH3K27me3, H3K9me2/3, H3K4me2, H3K9me and H4K12ac. The \npresence of these marks was studied in sperm samples from nor -\nmozoospermic donors (n = 5) and from infertile patients undergoing \nassisted reproductive techniques (n = 13) and then, we correlated \nthem with sperm parameters and ART success. A negative correla -\ntion was found between H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications \nwith motility in donor sperm (p <0.05 and p <0.01, respectively) and \na positive correlation was found between H3K4me3 and motility in \nsperm from patients (p <0.05). When we analyzed the correlation of \nthe modified histones with the fertilization rate, we observed a nega -\ntive correlation between the presence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 \n(p <0.05 in both cases) and a negative correlation was observed \nbetween the presence of H3K4me2 and the embryonic score (p \n<0.05). Based on these results, our study provides critical informa -\ntion on the implications of the presence of certain modified histones \nin sperm chromatin, on sperm functionality and the success of ART.ABSTRACTS249\nTOXICOLOG\u00cdA\n564.

Our aim was to evaluate whether \nperinatal exposure to a mixture of PRO and GLY (PROGLY) alters \nthe ventral prostate (VP) development in postpubertal rats. Pregnant \nrats were orally exposed to vehicle (saline solution) or a mixture of \nPRO and GLY (each 4 mg/kg/day), from gestation day 9 until wean -\ning. On postnatal day 60, male offspring were euthanized, and the \nprostate and serum samples were collected. Body weight and wet \nweight of the prostate complex (anterior, dorsolateral and ventral \nlobes) plus seminal vesicles were recorded. The testosterone (T) \nserum level was measured. In the VP, height of the prostatic epithe -\nlium (HPE), acinar luminal area (ALA) and acinar area (AA) were \nevaluated, as well as the presence of lesions in histological sections. \nAlso, the proliferation index (Ki67) was assessed by immunohisto -\nchemistry. Both body weight and relative prostate weight were sim -\nilar between the experimental groups. Although a decreased serum \nT level was observed in rats exposed to PROGLY, no significant \ndifferences were found compared to controls. Histologically, the \nHPE was increased (Control: 20.3\u00b11.1 \u00b5m vs PROGLY: 26.0\u00b11.2 \n\u00b5m; p<0.05) and the ALA was decreased (Control: 28578\u00b12241 \u00b5m2 \nvs PROGLY: 22321\u00b1915 \u00b5m2; p<0.05) in the VP of PROGLY rats \ncompared to controls. However, no significant differences were ob -\nserved in the AA between groups. In PROGLY rats, foci of epithelial \nhyperplasias were found in the VP, whereas the epithelium prolifera -\ntion index was similar compared to controls. In conclusion, perinatal \nexposure to a mixture of PROGLY alters the development of the VP, \ninducing hypertrophy of the prostatic epithelium and prostate lesions \nin postpubertal male rats.\n565.

In pre -\nvious studies, we demonstrated that glyphosate-based herbicides \n(GBH), acting as EDC, altered ovarian follicular development, in the \newe. In present study, we tested if the exposure of neonatal ewe \nlambs with the recently defined reference dose of GBH (US-EPA) \nalters the expression of genes involved in ovarian follicular develop -\nment. Ewe lambs received oral treatment from postnatal day (PND) \n1 to PND14 and the ovarian genes were evaluated at PND45. Ewe \nlambs were randomly assigned to the groups, GBH (n=5) received \nthe reference dose (glyphosate at 1 mg/Kg/day) and controls (n=6) \nreceived saline solution. On PND45, the ovaries were collected and \nimmediately frozen at -80 \u00b0C for further RNA extraction. Levels of \nmRNA of genes involved in follicular development such as steroid \nreceptors (ESR1, ESR2, and PR), follicle-stimulating hormone re -ceptor (FSHr), bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15), Follista -\ntin (FST), growth and differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), insulin-like \ngrowth factor 1 (IGF-1) and Activin A Receptor Type 2A (ACVR2) \nwere determined. The mRNA expression of \u03b2-Actin was used as \nhousekeeping gene. The mRNA expression levels in GBH-treat -\ned lambs were indicated as values relative to those of the control \ngroup. Treated ewe lambs showed a significant reduction (p<0.05) \nof mRNA of ESR1 (57%), ESR2 (63%), PR (73%), FSHr (33%) IGF1 \n(64%), ACVR2 (86%) and FST (57%). No variation was found in \nmRNA expression of BMP15 or GDF9. Our results demonstrate that \nneonatal exposure to low doses of GBH altered the expression of \ngenes involved in follicular development and differentiation. These \nresults provide evidence supporting previous studies showing that \nGBH alter follicular development in prepubertal lambs and raise con -\ncern about ovarian function in adults. \n566.

Progesterone \nand estrogen signaling are disrupted, commonly resulting in pro -\ngesterone resistance and estrogen dominance. Several studies \nsuggested that endocrine disrupting chemicals such as organochlo -\nrine pesticides could be a risk factor for endometriosis. Previously, \nwe reported that Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) acts as an endocrine \ndisruptor in uterus and mammary gland, modulating the hormonal \nsignaling. Is a weak ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) \nand promotes metalloproteinase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) \nexpression, as well as, c-Src kinase activation in human endometri -\nal stromal cells (T-HESC) and in rat endometriosis model. Our aim \nwas to evaluate the HCB effect on hormonal pathways, studying Es -\ntrogen and Progesterone Receptors (ER\u0251; PR) expression and acti -\nvation (WB), aromatase levels (WB), and on cell migration (scratch \nmotility assay) and invasion (transwell assay) in endometrial stromal \ncells (T-HESC). Moreover, we examine the dependence of AhR, \nc-Src, COX-2 and ER on these events. T-HESC cells were exposed \nto HCB (0.005, 0.05, 0.5 and 5 \u03bcM) at different lapse of time. Re -\nsults show that HCB increases ER\u0251 levels at 0.5 and 5 \u00b5M (p<0.05) \nand reduces PR content at 5 \u00b5M (p<0.05), in concordance with en -\ndometriosis estrogen-dependent and progesterone-resistance. In \naddition, aromatase expression is also raised by HCB at 0.005-0.5 \n\u00b5M (p<0.01; p<0.05). Moreover, cell migration (0.005\u20135 \u00b5M) and \ninvasion (0.05 and 5 \u00b5M) is promoted by the pesticide exposure in -\nvolving the AhR, c-Src, COX-2 and ER pathways. HCB also triggers \nER\u0251 activation via phosphorylation in Y537 (HCB 0.5 \u00b5M) through \nthe AhR/c-Src pathway. Our results provide experimental evidence \nthat HCB induces alterations associated with endometriosis. The \npesticide could act as a xenoestrogen inducing an invasive profile \ncontributing to the development and progression of the disease. \n567.

Argentina.\n e-mail: estelaleonormotta@hotmail.com\nMycotoxins are secondary metabolites of toxic fungi that are fre -\nquently found as contaminants in food and present toxic effects to \nanimals and human. Beer is widely consumed by the population.  \nCereals used in beer production, particularly barley, wheat and corn, \ncan be contaminated by mycotoxins.  Objective : was to estimate the \nexposure to different mycotoxins (FB, trichothecenes, OTA, ZEA, \nAFB) in beer in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Materials \nand Methods : A survey was carried out by google form (n = 314) \nto know the consumption of beer and to determine the exposure to \ndifferent mycotoxins. Results : From the surveyed population over \n18 years old, 79.8% consume beer. The highest daily beer con -\nsumption (284.4 ml/day) was observed in the range of 36-50 years \nold; 64.5% of the population consumes both craft and industrial beer \nand 23.4% only consumes craft beer. From the daily beer intake \nsurveyed in this study and the occurrence of mycotoxins in beer of \nprevious publications, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of mycotoxins \nwas obtained.  It was observed that beer consumption contributed to \n8.5, 5.1, 18.5 and 0.38% of the tolerable daily intake (TDI) of ochra -\ntoxin A (OTA), fumonisin B (FB), toxin T-2 (T-2) and zearalenone \n(ZEA) respectively. In the case of DON, it was estimated that beer \nconsumption contributes with 67.6% of TDI.  Previous publications \ninformed that the occurrence of DON in 60 % of beers were less \nthan 10 ng/ml (% of DON TDI= 4.47 %) and craft beer could reach \n63 ng/ml (% of DON TDI= 63 %). Conclusion : The EDIs   were below \nthe tolerable daily intakes (TDI). The beer consumption contribut -\ned between 0.38% to 18.5% to each mycotoxins TDI, except DON, \nwhere the EDI of DON could be close to the TDI. Therefore, the \nanalysis of mycotoxins in beer (industrial and artisanal) in our envi -\nronment, especially DON, is necessary.\n568.

Furthermore, child \nmalnutrition is recognized as a major problem with devastating ef -\nfects on children\u2019s health. Due to their physical and physiological \ncharacteristics, children conform a subpopulation highly susceptible \nto the adverse effect of environmental pollutants (gases and par -\nticulate matter -PM) and vulnerable to malnutrition. PM exposure \nincreases the risk for cardiovascular disease progression, through \nvascular oxidative stress and inflammation, two main processes in -\nvolved in the initiation of endothelial dysfunction.\nTherefore, we investigate the effects of ROFA (Residual Oil Fly Ash) \nexposure on the vasculature, in a nutritional retardation (NGR) rat \nmodel. In order to achieve NGR animals, male weanling rats were \nfed a diet restricted 20% compared to ad libitum  intake (control-C) \nfor 4 weeks. NGR and C rats were intranasally instilled with either \n1mg/kg BW of ROFA or its vehicle. 24h after exposure, the thorac -\nic aorta was isolated and biochemical parameters were evaluated: \nCYP1A1, eNOS and Calcium channel type L by RT-PCR, TGF\u03b21 by \nWesten blot and cytokines (IL-6, IL-10) by ELISA. \nOur data showed that ROFA exposure induced IL-6 and IL-10 aug -\nmentation vs. C rats (35% and 30%, p<0.01). No changes were ob -\nserved in NGR cytokines levels. \nLikewise, ROFA increased CYP1A1 levels vs. C (183%, p<0.001) \nand TGF-\u03b21 levels vs. C (216%, p<0.001) and vs. NGR (133%, p<0.01). On the other hand, exposure to ROFA decreased eNOs \nlevels vs. C (75%, p<0.001) and vs. NGR (38%, p<0.01), and calci -\num channels vs C (34%, p<0.01) and vs. NGR (20%, p<0.05).\nThese results showed that NGR animals failed to activate inflamma -\ntory and detoxifying response to ROFA. In relation to the contractile \ncapacity of the vascular system, a frank decrease is observed, as \nwell as a phenotypic change towards a more undifferentiated cell \ntype.\n569.

In previous works we have \nshown that dermal exposure to a commonly used UV-filter, benzo -\nphenone-3 (BP3) affected fetal growth of the progeny in mice. The \naim of the present study was to evaluate the underlying mechanism \nof the effects of BP3 on fetal weight. For that purpose, C57BL6 mice \nwere dermally exposed either to BP3 (50 mg/kg/day) or to vehicle \n(olive oil) on a daily basis, from gestational day 0 (gd0) until their \nsacrifice on gd10 or gd14. In the groups of animals sacrificed on \ngd10, there was a significant difference in the size of the whole im -\nplantation sites (WIS), being the WIS of the BP-3 treated animals \nsmaller than those of the control group (p<0,01). When analyzing \nthe wall-to-lumen diameter of the spiral arteries of paraffin-embed -\nded WIS samples, those WIS of smaller size in the BP-3 group \npresented a bigger wall-to-lumen ratio whereas WIS of normal size \nfrom the BP-3 group (p<0,01) or from the control group (p<0,001) \npresented normal wall-to-lumen ratio, showing that only WIS of ab -\nnormal size had impaired spiral artery remodeling. When analyzing \nthe animals at gd14, fetuses from the BP-3 treated animals were \nsignificantly smaller than fetuses from the control group (p<0,05), \nconfirming the observations from gd10. Serum samples from all fe -\nmales were analyzed for their BP-3 content by HPLC. In BP3 treated \nanimals, BP3 was found in 4 of 5 serum samples from gd10 and in \n3 of 6 serum samples from gd14. BP3 was also found in amniotic \nfluid at gd14. These results indicate that BP3 is incorporated to the \nsystemic circulation once applied dermally and it is able to reach \nthe fetus. Taken all together, these results confirm that during preg -\nnancy, BP3 is able to reach the maternal-fetal interface and affect \nthe remodeling of spiral arteries, leading to an intrauterine growth \nrestriction phenotype.\n570.

Previously, in rats, we detected that: a) \ncafeteria diet (CAF) induced endometrial hyperplasia (EH), a pre -\ncursor lesion of EC; b) exposure to glyphosate-based herbicide \n(GBH) altered uterine development causing EH and increased cell \nproliferation. In the present work we sought to evaluate whether \nthe exposure to a low-dose of a GBH plus CAF diet might enhance \nthe uterine morphological alterations induced by CAF diet alone. \nFemale Wistar rats were fed from postnatal day 21 (PND21) until \nPND240 with: chow diet (CON) or CAF. At PND140 one group of \nrats feed with CAF also received GBH through food, yielding 3 ex -ABSTRACTS251\nperimental groups: CON; CAF; CAF+GBH. Rats were sacrificed at \nPND240 and serum, fat depots, and uterine samples were obtained. \nData were analyzed by Kruskal\u2013Wallis followed by Mann-Whitney \npost-test (p<0.05). CAF and CAF+GBH increased the fat depots \nrelative to body weight compared to CON group. At morphological \nlevel, CAF and CAF+GBH increased glandular volume fraction and \nstromal nuclei density. At protein level, we detected higher expres -\nsion of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and cell proliferation in both \ntreated-groups respect to CON. Moreover, both CAF and CAF+GBH \ntreatments increased volume fraction of abnormal glands (glands \nwith cellular anomalies plus glands with daughter glands). This al -\nteration was more pronounced in CAF+GBH group, suggesting that \nGBH could enhance CAF effects. Also, only CAF-GBH reduced the \nexpression of PTEN (a tumor suppressor gene) in the subepithelial \nstroma respect to CON. Progesterone serum levels were higher in \nCAF+GBH compared to CON. In conclusion, although CAF induces \nseveral changes associated with EH, the co-exposure with GBH in -\ncreases the risk of developing EC. It is important to highlight that the \nstudy of lifestyle factors in combination could have a better contribu -\ntion to understand a complex pathology like the EC. \n571.

Several \nin vitro  and in vivo  studies evidenced the ability of BP3 to act like an \nendocrine disrupting chemical. The present study focuses on the \neffect of BP3 on the migration capacity of human trophoblast cells \n(Swan 71 cell line) and the potential involvement of the androgen \nreceptor (AR) pathway. We analyzed three different BP3 concen -\ntrations: a) BP3-2: the predicted no-effect concentration (2 \u03bcg/L), b) \nBP3-20: the concentration detected in the amniotic fluid (20 \u03bcg/L) in \nour previous studies and c) BP3-200: the plasma concentrations re -\nported in humans (200 \u03bcg/L). We examined cell migration activity by \nscratch-wound healing assay, as well as mRNA relative expression \nlevels of molecules of interest such as, AR, matrix metalloproteinase \n2 (MMP2), inhibitor of MMP-2 (TIMP2) and laminin a4 (LAMA4). The \nthree doses of BP3 reduced the area of wound closure after 24 h \nof exposure, evidencing reduced migration of Swan 71 cells when \ncompared to the vehicle. Interestingly, BP3 induced an augmented \nexpression of AR mRNA levels in all concentrations assayed, and of \nTIMP2 and LAMA4 only in BP3-2. MMP-2 did not show significant \nchanges. In order to confirm whether BP3 acts via an AR-dependent \npathway, we then analyzed BP3 effects with and without an AR in -\nhibitor (Flutamide, 1 \u00b5M). When the cells were treated with BP3 in \nthe presence of flutamide, the area of wound closure did not change \nafter 24 h, clearly indicating that BP3 acts through a AR-dependent \npathway. This was confirmed by the AR mRNA expression restora -\ntion in cells exposed to BP3 + flutamide. In conclusion, exposure to \nrelevant doses of BP3 is enough to perturb the migration capability \nand the expression of AR mRNA levels of the trophoblast cell line \nSwan 71. These effects were reversed in the presence of an AR \ninhibitor indicating that BP3 could act via AR-dependent pathway.\n573.

Airborne \npollutants such as particulate matter (PM) are associated with en -\nhanced health risk as they can trigger or aggravate several pulmo -\nnary diseases. Our aim was to assess if alterations in the lung oxida -\ntive metabolism initiated by toxicological mechanisms triggered after \nPM inhalation were associated with a delayed tissue injury repair. To \ncharacterize our model, BALB/c mice were exposed to filtered air \n(FA) or urban air (UA) from Buenos Aires City, in whole-body expo -\nsure chambers. Results showed that after 8 weeks of UA exposure, \nmice developed lung redox alterations and local inflammation with -\nout histological damage, therefore that was the time point selected \nto further evaluate the oxidative metabolism after a moderate lung \ninjury induced by intratracheal instillation of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid \n(HCl). Pulmonary tissue was evaluated 5 days after HCl treatment. \nTissue oxygen consumption was assessed as a whole lung metabo -\nlism marker, and the increase observed in mice breathing FA by HCl \ntreatment, was not detected in HCl-mice exposed to UA ( p<0.05). \nInterestingly, SOD activity showed the same trend ( p<0.05), even \nthough transcription factor Nrf2 expression was higher after the in -MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

While no edema was observed in \nany group, local inflammation measured as total cell count in bron -\nchoalveolar lavage (BAL), was significantly increased only after UA \nexposure and HCl instillation (p<0.05) compared to control values. \nHence, mice breathing UA might not be able to modulate the redox \nmetabolism involved in lung damage repair mechanisms. Our re -\nsults highlight the importance of tissue healing mechanisms eval -\nuation as valuable knowledge for developing adequate therapeutic \napproaches aiming to ensure restoration of normal alveolar architec -\nture required for proper lung function.\n574.

Depar -\ntamento de patolog\u00eda.\nPrevious reports indicate that central nervous system (CNS) is a \ntarget of air pollution, causing tissue damage and functional alter -\nations. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation have been pointed \nout as possible mechanisms mediating these effects. The aim of this \nwork was to study the chronic effects of urban air pollution on mice \nolfactory bulb (OB), focusing on oxidative stress and inflammation \nmarkers. Male 8-week-old BALB/c mice were exposed to filtered air \n(FA, control) or urban air (UA) inside whole-body chambers, located \nin a highly polluted area of Buenos Aires city, for up to 4 weeks. \nReduced glutathione levels (GSH) were decreased by 75% after 4 w \nof exposure to UA ( p<0.05). In accordance with these results, an in -\ncrease in glutathione reductase activity was found at the same time \npoint ( p<0.05 vs. FA). Total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, \nincluding a differential analysis of its cytosolic and the mitochondrial \nisoforms, Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD respectively, were determined. \nCu/Zn-SOD activity showed an initial decrease after 1 w of UA ex -\nposure compared to FA, and a subsequent increase of 50% at week \n4 (p<0.05), while no changes were observed for Mn-SOD activity. \nAlso, protein expression of NOX4 and NOX2 (p47phox subunit), both \nNOX isoforms commonly found increased in inflammatory process -\nes, were augmented in UA group, after 1 and 4 w, respectively \n(p<0.05). Moreover, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein \nexpression levels were found augmented for all exposure times \nevaluated, in UA compared to FA (p<0.05), suggesting an inflam -\nmatory process in OB, which is in accordance with previous results, \nwhere astrocyte activation was found in this tissue. Taken together, \nUA exposure showed an increase in oxidants production and inflam -\nmation markers in OB that might lead to tissue oxidative stress and \nan inflammatory response in this tissue. These data indicate that \noxidative stress may play a key role in CNS damage mechanisms \ntriggered by air pollution.\n575.

We have previously reported that neonatal exposure of ewe lambs to a low dose of GBH induced permanent changes in the \nuterus and ovaries. Moreover, neonatal exposure of female rats to \nGBH decreased the fertility rate. Here, our aim was to assess the \nlong-term effects of neonatal oral exposure to GBH in the oviduct \nof ewe lambs. To achieve this, ewe lambs were orally exposed from \npostnatal day (PND) 1 to PND14 to vehicle (n=6) or the reference \ndose of a GBH (1 mg glyphosate/Kg/day) (n=4). Since oviduct is \ntarget of estrogen, we also tested the effect of a gonadotrophic stim -\nulus (pFSH, Follitropin 50 mg/day from PND41 to PND43) in GBH \ntreated ewe lambs: vehicle+pFSH (n=6) and GBH+pFSH (n=4). At \nPND45, the isthmus and ampulla of oviducts were collected, paraffin \nembedded or stored at -80\u00b0C until mRNA extraction. The thickness \nof the myosalpinx was determined by digital analysis of picrosiri -\nus-hematoxylin-stained oviduct in transversal sections using FIJI \nsoftware. The expression of Ki67 (as cell proliferation marker), and \nof \u03b1-alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) were evaluated by immu -\nnohistochemistry. The gene expression of steroid receptors (ER\u03b1 \nand PR) was evaluated by RT-PCR. The thickness of the myosal -\npinx and cell proliferation showed no differences between the ex -\nperimental groups. Moreover, no alterations in the expression of \n\u03b1-SMA or steroid receptors mRNA was found. These results demon -\nstrate that neonatal exposure to a low dose of GBH alone or with \na gonadotrophic treatment does not alter the development of the \noviduct myosalpinx, which allows us to assume that function of ovi -\nduct (gametes transport and fertilization of the oocyte) might not be \naffected following GBH exposure. Nevertheless, more studies are \nneeded to conclude that the decrease in female fertility due to GBH \ntreatment is not due to oviduct alterations.\n576.

M&M: the HCB effect on PCNA (Western blot)/TGF-\u03b21 \n(RT-PCR) was studied in vitro in: 1.1) Huh-7: HCB at various doses \n(0.005, 0.05, 0.5 and 5 \u00b5M ) and times (15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min); \n1.2) Huh-7 transiently transfected with HBx; 2) HepG2.2.15 (with \nstable expression of HBV) and 3) EA-hy926 (endothelial). In 1.2, \n2 and 3 5 \u00b5M HCB, 24h was used. Mice: HCB i.p. (0.3 and 3 mg/\nkg), and were inoculated with HepG2. Were evaluated: a) PCNA, \nb) TGF-\u03b21, c) No. of tumor areas, d) histology (H&E) and e) No. of \nvessels/mm2. Results: In Huh-7, TGF-\u03b21 increased (20%, p <0.05; \n69% and 78%, p <0.01, with 0.05, 0.5 and 5 \u00b5M HCB, respective -\nly) and PCNA (45% and 60%, p <0.01, with 0.5 and 5 \u00b5M HCB, \nrespectively). In Huh-7 / HBx, PCNA and TGF-\u03b21 increased 66% \nand 71% (p <0.01). In Huh-7 / HBx and 5 \u00b5M HCB, PCNA increased \n120% (p <0.001). In HepG2.2.15 PCNA was overexpressed 76% (p \n<0.001). In EA-hy926, PCNA (29%, p <0.05) and TGF-\u03b21 (43%, p \n<0.01) increased.

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as \npesticides, has been postulated as a risk factor in this disease. We \nhave previously demonstrated that the organochlorine Hexachloro -\nbenzene (HCB) has stimulated breast tumor progression, favoring \ncell migration, invasion and angiogenesis. HCB is a weak ligand of \nthe Aromatic Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR), a transcription factor \nrelated to tumor and vascular development. Furthermore, we have \nreported that HCB acts as an endocrine disruptor in the mammary \ngland and uterus in different animal models. Estrogens play a fun -\ndamental role in the etiology of breast cancer, whose actions are \nmediated by their \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoform receptors. However, the role of \nER-\u03b2 is not entirely clear, with evidence of a reduction in proliferation \nand angiogenesis in ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cell lines, while in \ntriple-negative cells (RE-/RP-/HER2-) performs the opposite func -\ntion. G-protein-coupled ER (GPR30) mediates the action of estro -\ngens in breast tumors and cancer-associated fibroblasts, leading \nto tumor progression. In the present study, we have examined the \naction of HCB (0.03, 0.3 and 3 mg/kg body weight, bw) in a LM3 \nsyngeneic breast cancer mouse model (ER-/PR-/HER2+). Our re -\nsults indicated that HCB induces an increase in tumor weight and \nvolume at 3 mg/kg bw (p<0.05) and promotes a rise in the metas -\ntasis number in the lung at 0.3 mg/kg bw (p<0.001). In the tumor \ntissue, HCB enhances the protein expression of AhR and Vascular \nEndothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) at all doses tested (Western Blot; \np<0.05). In addition, the pesticide exposure decreases the protein \nlevels of ER-\u03b2 while increasing the GPR30 expression (Western \nblot; p<0.05). These results indicate that HCB exposure induces a \ndysregulation in the expression of the different types of estrogen \nreceptors, collaborating with the promotion and tumor growth in the \nHER2-positive breast cancer model.\n578.

Iron is abundant in nature, an essential \nmetal for humans, and a suitable candidate for NPs synthesis with \npossible microbicidal activity. In this work we biosynthesized iron \nNPs (FeNPs) and studied possible toxic effects in the human kerat -\ninocyte cell line HaCaT.\nFeNPs were synthesized using Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), \ncharacterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy and by transmission electron \nmicroscopy. HaCaT cells were incubated for 4 and 24 h\nat different FeNPs concentrations (535; 214, 107, 53.5 and 26.75 \n\ud835\udf07g/ml).

We investigated cell vi -\nability by MTT and neutral red test (NRT), reactive oxygen species \n(ROS) by DCF-DA and by NBT, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activ -\nity by the riboflavin-NBT method, and glutathione (GSH) content by \nthe Ellman method.\nFeNPs had a spherical shape with an average size of \u2248 20 nm. Cell \nviability decreased after 4\nand 24 h incubation with FeNPs 535 \ud835\udf07g/ml, and CCB 1/2. However, \nno changes in NRT uptake were observed at 4 and 24 h. The ROS \nlevels were significantly increased after 4 h  and 24 h\nincubation with all the treatments assayed. In addition, O2- produc -\ntion significantly increased at 24\nh of incubation with FeNPs 535 \ud835\udf07g/ml, and CCB 1/2. SOD activity \nwas increased at all treatments tested. Finally, the GSH content was \nnot modified by any treatment at 24 h.\nAltogether these results suggest that the highest FeNPs concen -\ntration significantly modifies the cell viability with increase in O2-, \nROS, and SOD. In contrast, other stimuli were able to modify Ha -\nCaT oxidant/antioxidant cell balance, but not cell viability. Prolonged \nincubation studies are needed in order to determine if cell viability \nis altered at lower concentrations and to unravel the mechanisms \nunderlying these alterations.\n579.

Previously, we have demonstrated that exposure to \nBP3 alters beta-casein (CSN2) and alpha-lactalbumin (LALBA) \nmilk protein expression during functional differentiation of the MG \nin vitro . Here, our aim was to evaluate whether intrauterine expo -\nsure to BP3 alters the lactating mammary gland in the F1 female \noffspring. Pregnant F0 C57BL/6 mice were dermally exposed to \nvehicle (sesame oil; Control), 0.15 (0.15BP3) or 50mg BP3/kg/day \n(50BP3) from gestation day 8.5 to 18. At 8 weeks-old, female off -\nspring (F1) were bred and MG samples were obtained on lactation \nday 10. The protein expression of the myoepithelial cell biomarker \nalpha-smooth muscle actin, CSN2 and LALBA was assessed by \nimmunohistochemistry. The perimeter and area of the alveoli and \nthe myoepithelial linear density were measured to establish either \nthe proportion of large/small alveoli per group or the maturation and \ndifferentiation of the myoepithelial cells. CSN2, LALBA and whey \nacidic protein (WAP) mRNA expression was evaluated by qRT-PCR. \nThe alveolar perimeter in 0.15BP3 animals was the lowest among \ngroups (p<0.05). Conversely, 50BP3 animals showed the highest \nalveolar area compared to 0.15BP3 ones (p<0.05). In addition, BP3 \ntreatments had opposite effects on the proportion of large/small al -\nveoli: whereas it was similar in control animals (47.3/52.7), it was MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Also, the myoepithelial linear density was \nlower in 0.15BP3 than in control animals (p<0.05). In contrast, the \nprotein expression of CSN2 and LALBA, and the mRNA expression \nof CSN2, LALBA and WAP were similar between groups (p>0.05). \nIn conclusion, the intrauterine exposure to BP3 altered the lactating \nMG, and these effects could be related to the alveolar secretory con -\ntent and/or its contractile function.\n580.

The chronic \neffects on reproductive outcomes associated with long-term expo -\nsure to GBHs remain unexplored. In the present work, we investigat -\ned, in Wistar rats, the effects of chronic oral administration of a safe \ndose of a commercial GBH on: 1) body weight and food intake; 2) \nreproductive performance and feto-placental parameters.\nFemale rats were exposed to GBH through food, in a dose of 2 mg \nof glyphosate/kg bw/day, from postnatal day 21 (PND21) and during \n11 weeks. Control group (CON) was provided with a laboratory pel -\nlet chow-based paste. Body weight and food intake were registered \nalong the exposure. Females at the proestrus stage were caged with \nmales with proven fertility. We evaluated the pregnancy rate by as -\nsessing the number of pregnant females/number of females housed \nwith a male x 100. In addition, we determined the reproductive per -\nformance by quantifying the number of corpora lutea, the implanta -\ntion sites (IS) and the resorption sites on gestational day 19 (GD19). \nThe fetuses and the placentas pairs were removed and weighted. \nThe placental index was calculated as follows: placental weight/fetal \nbody weight. Last, fetal length and litter size were determined.\nWe detected an increase in body weight of the rats exposed to GBH \n8 days after the beginning of treatment (PND30). However, not dif -\nferences were found on food intake between CON and GBH-treat -\ned rats. Regarding reproductive performance, we detected a lower \nnumber of IS in GBH group compared to CON group.

In conclusion, chronic exposure to \nGBH impaired female fertility and fetal development.

Hospital San Jos\u00e9 de Diamante, Entre R\u00edos.\nNowadays people are more often exposed to low dose(LD) ionizing \nradiation (IR). Knowledge on the health risks associated with expo -\nsures to ionizing radiation above 100 mGy is quite well established, \nwhile LD risks are inferred from higher level exposure by a linear \nnon-threshold (LNT) model, the estimation of long-term chronic sto -\nchastic radiation health effects (such as cancer) by LNT extrapo -\nlations for LD-rates (<6 mGy/h) has been questioned. We provide \nevidence of acute DNA damage by the alkaline comet assay (ACA) \nin health institution personnel. We performed ACA and life style and \nhealth survey in 35 healthy volunteers with more than a year as \nstaff of a X-ray service or working at neighboring laboratories from 2 \npublic hospitals and primary health care services, we included per -sonnel with no history of cancer disease or HPV infection. The assay \nevidenced global DNA strand (double and single strand DNA) dam -\nage as is indicated by % of DNA tails over 200 nucleus, we consid -\nered a high range damage cut off over 15% (n=30 DNA tails, p-Value \n<0.05).Our results showed that 30% of personnel presented DNA \ntails over the 15%, a significantly higher % (p-value <0.05) over the \nother 70% of the individuals with an average of 5% \u00b13 of DNA tails \n(n=10 DNA tails nucleus). The staff labor distribution inside the hos -\npitals evidenced that higher % of DNA tail coincides with personnel \nof the X-ray imaging services and who were at immediate neighbor -\ning areas, the lifestyle and other bias variables taken into account \nby interviews did not allow evidencing other source of non-heritable \ngenetic damage. Conclusions: Even if there may be significant DNA \ndamage associated to X ray sources we cannot associate it to in -\ncrease cancer risk or deviations from LNT theory. We conclude that \nthe risks for any type of cancer could be lower than those predicted \nby a linear extrapolation, but they could also be higher. Until more \nresults concerning the effects of chronic low-dose exposure are \navailable, we pursue the determination of biomarkers for cancer risk \nin the same cohort and suggest a reasonable radiation protection \napproach as other measure such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) \nscavenger administration.\n582.

HBV DNA encodes transactivator X (HBx). HCB is \na COP promoter of hepatic preneoplastic foci. We have shown that \nHCB deregulates cell growth in rat liver and HepG2 cells, involving \nTGF-\u03b21, a reversed effect with an R\u03b21 inhibitor.\nObjectives: To analyze in vitro 2 models of HCC generation -asso -\nciated to HCB or to the expression of HBx- and in vivo the hepatic \nand angiogenic promoter HCB effect in Balb/c nude mice inoculated \nwith HepG2. M&M: the HCB effect on PCNA (Western blot)/TGF-\u03b21 \n(RT-PCR) was studied in vitro in: 1.1) Huh-7: HCB at various doses \n(0.005, 0.05, 0.5 and 5 \u00b5M ) and times (15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min); \n1.2) Huh-7 transiently transfected with HBx; 2) HepG2.2.15 (with \nstable expression of HBV) and 3) EA-hy926 (endothelial). In 1.2, \n2 and 3 5 \u00b5M HCB, 24h was used. Mice: HCB i.p. (0.3 and 3 mg/\nkg), and were inoculated with HepG2. Were evaluated: a) PCNA, \nb) TGF-\u03b21, c) No. of tumor areas, d) histology (H&E) and e) No. of \nvessels/mm2. Results: In Huh-7, TGF-\u03b21 increased (20%, p <0.05; \n69% and 78%, p <0.01, with 0.05, 0.5 and 5 \u00b5M HCB, respective -\nly) and PCNA (45% and 60%, p <0.01, with 0.5 and 5 \u00b5M HCB, \nrespectively). In Huh-7 / HBx, PCNA and TGF-\u03b21 increased 66% \nand 71% (p <0.01). In Huh-7 / HBx and 5 \u00b5M HCB, PCNA increased \n120% (p <0.001). In HepG2.2.15 PCNA was overexpressed 76% (p \n<0.001). In EA-hy926, PCNA (29%, p <0.05) and TGF-\u03b21 (43%, p \n<0.01) increased. In mice, PCNA (39%; p <0.01), TGF-\u03b21 (48%; p \n<0.01), preneoplastic areas (320%; p <0.001) and vascularization \n(35%; p <0.01).\nConclusions: HCB promotes preneoplastic cell proliferation and \nangiogenesis in nude mice inoculated with HepG2, while HCB and \nHBx induce in vitro cell proliferation associated with the increase \nof TGF-\u03b21 in the examined lines, a proliferative effect increased to \nthat promoted by the HCB being able to participate in the induction \nof HCC.\n583.

Our aim \nwas to assess the 24-hour kinetics of the local and system -\nic damage induced by the Argentinean Lonomia sp. venom (50 \n\u00b5L of 1 mg/Kg body weight, i.d., dissolved in PBS prior to injec -\ntion) in male CF1 mice (n = 3 for each time point). After 2, 5, 10  \nand 24 h of injection, animals were anesthetized with ketamine 100 \nmg/Kg and xilazine 10 mg/Kg (i.p.), and tissue fragments were re -\nmoved for histological analysis. By direct macroscopic examination, \nwe evidenced an erythematous reaction that developed rapidly at \nthe injection site. The microscopical data showed detachment of \nthe epidermis, and disorganization of the dermal structure; the latter \nis apparently caused by inflammatory infiltrate and edema, both of \nwhich decreased considerably by 24 h after venom injection. Sys -\ntemically, we revealed liver damage characterized by infiltration of \npolymorphonuclear inflammatory cells, centrilobular vascular con -\ngestion, dilation of sinusoids, and necrosis of hepatocytes; the last \ninjury was preferentially observed in zones 2 and 3 of the hepatic \nacinus. In lung sections, we observed loss of the alveolar wall struc -\nture associated with detachment of type II pneumocytes, and large \nareas of hemorrhage and atelectasis. The systemic pathological \nchanges were more pronounced at later time points. These findings \nhave implications within the clinical setting for lonomism in Argenti -\nna, and support the need for looking further into an effective therapy \navailable for this envenomation in this country.\n584.

We studied its effects on lung fibrosis and HSP expression \nunder different diets. 4 lots of female Wistar rats were used: 2 lots \nreceived casein (Cas) and 2 lots received soy (So) as protein sourc -\nes. Within each group: 1 lot received regular water (control-Co) and \nthe other 15ppm of Cd in the drinking water for 60days. Lungs were \nhydrolyzed and hydroxyproline (Hyp) was quantified by the chlora -\nmine-T method. The color was read in a spectrophotometer at 550 \nnm. Lung tissues were fixed, dehydrated, cleared in xylene, and em -\nbedded in paraffin. Sections of 5\u20136\u00b5m thickness were stained with \nMasson\u2019s trichrome solution for histology assessment. Immunohis -\ntochemistry was performed by using Hsp27 and Hsp70 antibodies. \nHyp showed an increase in CasCd group vs CasCo (p<0.005); in \nSoCd, Hyp levels were higher than SoCo (p<0.01) but lesser com -\npared with CasCd (p<0.05). Masson\u2019s Trichromic exposed that \nCasCo and SoCo have normal alveolar septa, without deposits \nof connective tissue. In CasCd, advanced pulmonary fibrosis and \nblue collagen deposits were evident throughout the lung. In SoCd, \ncollagen deposition was observed around the intrapulmonary tree \nand lung vessels. Hsp27 showed an increase of its expression in Cd intoxicated groups, being only significant in CasCd vs CasCo \n(p<0.05). Hsp70 exhibited higher levels in SoCd vs SoCo, without \ndifferences among casein-fed groups. We conclude that Cd induce \nlung fibrosis, and soy might have a protective effect. It has been \nproven that Hsp27 promotes fibrosis in animal models. The higher \nexpression of Hsp70, a demonstrated anti-fibrotic protein, induced \nby soy could protect against Cd-induced fibrosis.\n585.

The aim of this \nstudy was to characterize its toxicity in cerebellum and the poten -\ntial reversal by a soybean-based diet. The glial fibrillary acid pro -\ntein (GFAP), indicator for neurotoxic effects in mature brain, was \nevaluated. Besides, we performed a morphometric and stereological \nanalysis. Female Wistar rats (n=12) were fed with casein (Cas) and \nsoybean diets (So) as protein source for 60 days. Simultaneous -\nly, half of the animals were administered either 15 ppm of Cd in \nwater or regular tap water as control. The cerebellums were fixed \nand processed for immunofluorescence. The samples were visu -\nalized by fluorescence microscopy and the positive fluorescence \narea for GFAP was quantified by IMAGE J Software. Morphometric \nanalysis included quantifying the number of granule cell neurons \n(CGn) and Purkinje cells neurons (Pkn) in serial 20\u03bcm-thick sec -\ntions stained with cresyl violet along the different lobules. We per -\nformed a three-dimensional volumetric reconstruction of the tissue \nthrough the use of the software Stereo Investigator. The thicknesses \nof the molecular and granular layers of the cerebellar cortex of lob -\nules I-X were determined on digital images. We found a decrease in \nthe number of CGn in the CasCd group vs. CasCo group (p<0.05) \nand SoCd group (p<0.01). On the contrary, the number of Pkn re -\nmained unchanged. In addition, there was a significant reduction in \nthe internal granular layer of CasCd group vs. SoCd group, while \nno effect was observed in the thickness of the molecular layer. The \ncortical thicknesses of the different regions of each folium base from \ncerebellar lobules I-X did not show significant differences between \nthe groups. Overall, these results unmask an irreversible toxic effect \nof low dose-sub chronic Cd intoxication on cerebellum and identify \na protective role of a soy-based diet with potential as a therapeutic \nstrategy for those individuals exposed to this dangerous environ -\nmental contaminant.588.

Snake venom \nplays a critical role in food acquisition, digestion, and defense. Ven -\noms are known to change throughout the life of some snake spe -\ncies, but little is known about the venom composition during juvenile \nstage. In the northeast (NEA), venom from B. alternatus  species, \nare known to display ontogenetic variation in both, biochemical and \nbiological activities. We reported a comparative cytotoxic analysis \nof venoms from juvenile and adult specimens of B. alternatus  and \ncorrelate it with the histological evaluation of crucial venom injuries \nfrom juvenile. Cytotoxic activity was assessed with undifferentiat -\ned myoblasts as cultured murine muscle cells (C2C12). After 3 h of \nvenom incubation, cell viability was quantified by crystal violet stain -\ning. To support the in vitro  damage, myotoxicity in gastrocnemius \nmuscle from mice was assayed (6.9 \u00b5g/g) and submitted to routine \nhistological processing and H&E staining. The venoms of B. alterna -\ntus juvenile and adult exhibited concentration-dependent cytotoxic \nactivities toward the C2C12 cell line tested. Both venoms exhibited \ndifferential cytotoxic effects, with venom from juvenile species being \nsignificantly more potent in inhibiting the growth of the myoblast cells \n(~55%) with venom concentrations of 5 \u00b5g/mL.  The histological ef -\nfects from juvenile muscle envenomation exhibited marked and per -\nsistent hemorrhage, edema forming, polymorphonuclear infiltrations \nand necrosis. We demonstrated that the ontogenetic shift in diet, \nfrom ectothermic prey in early life to endothermic prey in adulthood, \nand in animal size are associated with changes in the venom pro -\nteome in B. alternatus  species.

We have \npreviously shown that FA toxicity can not only be inflicted by damag -\ning the DNA but also through the accumulation of reactive oxygen \nspecies.\nTo further identify the mechanism by which FA is triggering cell death \nthrough oxidative stress, we searched for factors that are affected \nupon FA treatment. We found that the protein thioredoxin like-1 \n(TXNL1), which has been found associated with the 19S protea -\nsome, is downregulated upon acute exposure to FA in HCT116 col -\norectal cancer cells. The protein level of TXNL1 drops 31.7\u00b17.9% \nupon 5-h exposure to 200 uM FA, and 48.1\u00b114.4% upon 5-h ex -ABSTRACTS257\nposure to 400 uM FA as determined by western blot. On the other \nhand, chronic exposure to lower levels of FA does not  significant -\nly affect TXNL1 expression. In order to understand how TXNL1  is \ndownregulated, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of the pro -\nmoter region,  which revealed an Antioxidant Response Element \n(ARE) site, suggesting the oxidative stress master regulator NRF2 \nmight be involved in the control of  TXNL1. In contrast to the canoni -\ncal genes controlled by NRF2, the ARE  site detected in the promot -\ner of TXNL1 locates -7 pair bases  upstream from TSS (Eukaryotic \npromoter database, p-value: 0.00001), suggesting that NRF2  might \nbe directly repressing the expression of TXNL1 in response to FA.\nWe explored The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) data -\nbase and found that TXNL1 is significantly more expressed in many \ncancer biopsies when compared to normal tissues. Moreover, we \nexplored the GEPIA database and detected that reduced TXNL1 ex -\npression correlates with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (p-val -\nue=0.04). This result suggests that downregulation of TXNL1 might \nincrease aggressiveness of tumor cells.\n590.

We reported a stabili -\nzation of PTTG protein by RWD-containing SUMOylation enhancer \n(RSUME) in pituitary tumor cells. As a consequence, RSUME en -\nhances PTTG transcription factor and securin activities. \nObjective: We explore the molecular mechanism of PTTG up-reg -\nulation in tumoral cells by RSUME focusing in its action on PTTG \nconjugation to ubiquitin (Ub).\nMethods: We investigated PTTG degradation in COS-7 cells trans -\nfected with His-Ub vector, by Niquel affinity chromatography (Ni2+N-\nTA) assay purifying ubiquitinated proteins and posterior western blot \nwith specific PTTG-antibody. To inhibit the proteasome system, we \nused 10 or 20\u00b5M MG-132 for 6h; to accelerate PTTG degradation \nwe used 5 or 10\u00b5M Reversine for 24-48h; while an expression vec -\ntor of Gam1, a viral enzyme, was used to block SUMOylation.\nResults: By Ni2+NTA we observed that RSUME promotes a decrease \non Ub conjugation to PTTG, stepping up its protein abundance. \nRSUME knockdown decreases PTTG protein but had no effect on \nPTTG stability when the proteasome degradation is inhibited by MG-\n132.

The \naim of this study was to assess the role of the 20-HETE receptor, \nGPR75, in these actions.\nExpression and i.c. localization  of GPR75 or AR were studied by \nwestern blot (WB)  or immunofluorescence (IF), and TrAc of the AR \nby gene  reporter assay. RNA-seq gene expression data from Ge -\nnomic database TCGA-Prostate  Cancer were analyzed by UCSC \nXena browser. Statistics: t-student test or one-way ANOVA/Tukey\u2019s.\nIncubation of LNCaP cells with the GPR75 antagonist, 19-HEDE \n(5uM, 36h)  decreased AR expression by 20% (WB), or by 43% (IF)  \n(p<0.05 and p<0.01 vs control). Moreover, knockdown of GPR75 \n(LNCaP/siGPR75)  reduced AR expression by 80% (p\u22640.01 vs LN -\nCaP/siControl). 20-HETE increased  AR TrAc by 559% in siControl \ncells (p\u22640.0001), and this  response was abrogated in siGPR75 cells \n(p<0.0001 vs siControl+20-HETE).\nBesides, 20-HETE increased by 41% the nuclear localization of AR \n(IF, p<0.01 vs control), which was abolished by 19-HEDE (p<0.0001 \nvs 20-HETE). 20-HETE- induced AR nuclear redistribution was con -\nfirmed by subcellular fractionation and WB (20-HETE p<0.0001 vs \ncontrol; 19-HEDE+20- HETE p<0.0001 vs 20-HETE). Also, inhibi -\ntors of oncogenic pathways known to be activated by GPR75 (PKA, \nH-89 50uM; PKC, RO318220, 100nM; PI3K, LY294002, 25\u03bcM) re -\nverted 20-HETE-\ninduced AR  nuclear translocation (p<0.0001 vs 20-HETE for all).\nImportantly, a high positive correlation between AR and GPR75 \ngenes was found in human prostate cancer samples from TCGA, \n(Pearson\u2019s r= 0.66, p=2.59e-69; Spearman\u2019s r= 0.58, p=1.75e-50). \nMoreover, the correlation of the expression level of eight out of elev -\nen AR- dependent genes with the expression of GPR75 was sta -\ntistically significant according to Pearson and Spearman analysis.\nOur data strongly suggest a role of the 20-HETE/GPR75 axis in the \navailability of transcriptionally active androgen receptors in prostate \ncancer cells.\n592.

They \nexert their function by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), \nwhich in turn translocates to the nucleus and modulates gene tran -\nscription. FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is an Hsp90 co-chap -\nerone that tightly regulates the activity of the GR. Abnormal FKBP51 \nfunction has been associated to stress-related disorders and to \nantidepressant (AD) treatment response. Our group has demon -\nstrated the key role of FKBP51 SUMO conjugation in the regulation \nof Hsp90-mediated inhibitory effect on GR activity. Our data shows \nthat ADs, particularly clomipramine, inhibit FKBP51 SUMOylation by \ninhibiting its interaction with the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS4. The inhi -\nbition of FKBP51 SUMOylation by these drugs diminishes the for -\nmation of the inhibitory complex between FKBP51, Hsp90 and GR. \nTo confirm the importance of PIAS4 in this context we performed \nco-immunoprecipitation assays between FKBP51 and Hsp90 in the \npresence of clomipramine and increasing amounts of PIAS4. We \nobserved that PIAS4 over-expression dose dependently dampens \nthe inhibitory effect of clomipramine on FKBP51 and Hsp90 interac -\ntion (53,6\u00b116,7%; p<0,01). We also silenced PIAS4 expression in \nastrocyte cell cultures and observed an inhibition between GR and \nFKBP51 interaction (46,2\u00b1 10,6%; p<0,05). To analyze if ADs could MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Moreover \nwe observed that when we over-expressed PIAS4, clomipramine \ncould no longer sustain its inhibitory effect on FKBP51 activity. Simi -\nlar results were obtained by analyzing AD effect on GR transcription \nperformed by real-time PCR assays. Our findings provide a novel \nmolecular mechanism by which ADs can restore GR activity. \n593.

(191) CFTR CORRECTION WITH LUMACAFTOR/IVA -\nCAFTOR REDUCED THE MITOCHONDRIAL FRAGMENTA -\nTION IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS CULTURED EPITHELIAL CELLS\nJavier Kamida, Camila Dib, Tom\u00e1s A. Santa Coloma, \u00c1ngel \nG. Valdivieso\nLaboratory of Cell. & Mol. Biol. BIOMED-UCA-CONICET, \nBuenos Aires, Argentina   \nThe impairment of the CFTR channel, a cAMP-activated chloride \n(Cl-) channel responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF), has been associat -\ned with a variety of mitochondrial alterations. Recently, we reported \nan increase in mitochondrial fragmentation induced by the inhibition \nof the CFTR activity. The cAMP treatment to stimulate the CFTR \nactivity worsen this phenotype in CF cells. Here, we analysed the \nmitochondrial network in CF cells treated with the CFTR modulators \nLumacaftor (VX-809)/Ivacaftor (VX-770)  VX-809 act as pharmaco -\nlogical chaperone, increasing the amount of CFTR at the cell mem -\nbrane surface; while VX-770 increase the activation of the CFTR. \nSingle, combined and sequential treatments with VX-809 (10 \u03bcM, \nCFTR corrector) and VX-770 (10, 1 and 0.1 \u03bcM, CFTR enhancer) \nwere performed in IB3-1 cells (CF cells). Also, cAMP was tested as \na CFTR stimulator to compare its effect with VX-770. Mitochondria \nwere labelled with MitoTracker Orange, imaged by confocal micros -\ncopy, and analysed with Mitochondrial Network Analysis (MiNA) \nplugin for Fiji. A single treatment with VX-80948 h, but not with VX-\n770, reduced the mitochondrial fragmentation in IB3-1 cells, while \na combined treatment with VX-809/ VX-770 for 48 h had no effect. \nHowever, the preincubation with VX-809 24 h previous to VX-770 for \nanother 24 h reduced significantly the mitochondrial fragmentation. \nSimilar results were observed using cAMP to stimulate the CFTR \nactivity. These results suggest that CFTR potentiators could impair \nthe mitochondrial dynamics when the CFTR is not expressed on \nthe membrane surface. Further research is needed to identify the \nmechanisms involved in this regulation to improve the therapy by \nusing these drugs.  \n596.

IQUIBICEN-UBA/CONICET\nIn addition  to ribosomal proteins (RP), non-ribosomal proteins as -\nsociates with ribosomes, contributing  to ribosomal heterogeneity \nand ribosomal specialization, that is, different ribosomes  selectively \ntranslating mRNAs.\nThrough Immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectrometry assays \nwe identified a large number of RP associated with MageB2. Like-\nwise, co-IP assays showed that MageB2 co-immunoprecipitates \nwith RPS6 and LP2. MageB2 presents cytoplasmic, nuclear and nu -\ncleolar localization, with the latter being where ribosomal biogenesis \nbegins. Besides, we observed a correlation between MageB2 ex -\npression and protein synthesis. Here, we hypothesized that MageB2 \ncould be a ribosome-associated protein. In this sense, the purifica -\ntion of  ribosomes by ultracentrifugation in sucrose cushions showed \nMageB2 co-sedimentation with  cytoplasmic ribosomes. Then, we \nstudied whether MageB2 could associate with the ribosome in the ABSTRACTS259\nnucleolus. As a first step, we ectopically express MageB2 construc -\ntions with different degree of nucleolar localization (MageB2-GFP,  \nMageB21-118-GFP,  MageB229-319-GFP  and  MageB2118-319-\nGFP)  and  we observed that those  with marked nucleolar local -\nization (MageB2-GFP and MageB21-118-GFP) co- sediment better  \nwith cytoplasmic ribosomes, suggesting that the nucleolar localiza -\ntion of MageB2  favors its association with the ribosome. In line with \nthis, we observed that MageB2 co-sediments with ribosomal sub -\nunits in the  nuclear fraction. Previously, we reported that ribosomal \nstress causes MageB2 relocalization  from the nucleolus to the nu -\ncleo. Here we investigate the effect of ribosomal stress on MageB2 \nrecruitment to ribosomes. So far, we have not observed differences \nafter treatment with BMH-21 (RNA-PolI inhibitor).\nResults presented here suggest that MageB2, a tumor-specific pro -\ntein, associates with ribosomes under both normal and ribosomal \nstress conditions. It would be very attractive to know if this associa -\ntion promotes selective translation in cancer cells.\n597.

In addition \nto its parasiticidal effect, Bz inhibits the NF-\u03baB pathway through IL-\n10/STAT3/SOCS3. In this work we further studied the mechanisms \ninvolved in immunomodulation.\nTo dissociate the antiparasitic effect of Bzl from its anti-inflamma -\ntory properties, we used an in vitro  model of RAW 264.7 macro -\nphages stimulated with LPS. Treatment with Bz not only inhibited \nthe release of NO but also increased the expression of Arginase I \n(p<0.05). Moreover, mRNA expression of M1 and M2 macrophage \nmarkers was evaluated. Bz treatment not only reversed the in -\ncrease of pro-inflammatory cytokines but also increased the expres -\nsion of M2-macrophage markers like Mannose Receptor, TGF-\u03b2, \nand VEGF-A (p<0.05). Moreover, Bz increased the expression of \nPPAR-\u03b3 and PPAR-\u03b1, known as key regulators of macrophage po -\nlarization (p<0.05). \nPI3K directly regulates M1-to-M2 macrophage polarization. Thus, \nto assess the participation of PI3K in Bz effects, experiments were \nperformed in presence of LY294002, an inhibitor of the PI3K activity. \nM2 polarization was precluded by LY294002, as shown by the inhi -\nbition of Bz-mediated increase of M2-markers expression (p<0.05). \nFurthermore, in presence of LY294002, Bz could neither increase \nSOCS3 expression nor prevent I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation (p<0.05). \nSince the PI3K\u03b4 isoform is expressed in immune system cells and \nregulates the inflammatory response, experiments were carried out \nin presence of CAL-101, a specific inhibitor of this subunit. Under this \ncondition, Bz not only failed to inhibit the expression of pro-inflam -\nmatory cytokines but also could not increase M2 markers (p<0.05). \nTaken together, these results demonstrate, for the first time, that \nBz-mediated polarization to M2 macrophages involves the action of \nthe p110\u03b4 catalytic subunit of PI3K\u03b4.\n599.

It has \nalso been described that the addition of insulin influences markedly \nthe induction of ALA-S1 through the PI3K / Akt pathway. Therefore, \nin order to continue studying in vitro  the effects obtained with FBS \nand to extend the research to human serum (Sh) , it was decided to \nevaluate the effects of serum in cultures of the established line of \nhuman hepatoma C3A.The cells were grown in low glucose DMEM \nmedium (5 mM) and without serum for 18 h. The cells were then \ntreated with different concentrations of Sh (1, 2.5, and 10%), with \n2% Sh inactivated (Shi) by heat or stripped with activated carbon \n(SHe) and 2% FBS. The addition of Sh caused a significant increase \nin ALA-S1 protein (100%) at all concentrations. Heat inactivation or \nactivated carbon treatment had no effect on the induction of ALAS1 \nby Sh. However, the expression levels of ALA-S1 mRNA were sig -\nnificantly decreased (30%). This result agrees with the observed \nincrease of the phosphorylation levels of Akt (Ser473), an enzyme \nthat inactivates the transcription factor needed for the transcription \nof ALA-S1 mRNA. The phosphorylation levels of 4-EBP1 were 172% \nincreased. When 4-EBP1 is phosphorylated, the protein synthesis is \nfavored, thus the obtained result would suggest that the increase in \nALA-S1 protein is due to a greater translation. These results here \npresented constitute a significant contribution to the understanding \nof the molecular mechanisms that lead to changes in the expression \nof ALA-S1. Moreover, the in vitro  model used is adequate to further \nresearch the effect of Sh on ALA-S1.MEDICINA  - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 2021260\n600.

Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Argentina\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease caused by mutations in \nthe CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regulator) gene. It is \nprincipally characterized by chronic infections and persistent inflam -\nmation in lungs. One of the hypotheses that tried to explain the in -\ncreased susceptibility to lung infections is the reduction in the airway \nsurface liquid (ASL) pH. The changes observed in the extracellular \npH (pHe) could be a consequence of a reduced bicarbonate trans -\nport through CFTR and also an increase in lactic acid secretion. \nConsidering that the EGFR pathway is affected in the CF pheno -\ntype, the aim of the present work was to determine if the EGFR \npathway is involved in the extracellular pH regulation in CF cells. Two cellular models were used: IB3-1 cells (CF cells) and C38 cells \n(IB3-1 \u201ccorrected\u201d cells). Together with the extracellular pH and lactic \nacid (lactate) secretion measurements, LDH expression and activity \nwere performed by RT-PCR, Western Blot, flow cytometry, confocal \nmicroscopy and spectrophotometric techniques. The results report -\ned a decrease in pH in the extracellular medium culture (p<0.05) in \nIB3-1 cells concomitantly with an increased in lactate secretion and \nboth LDH expression and activity (p<0.05) compared with C38 cells. \nStudying the role of EGFR in pH regulation, we observed that inhibi -\ntion of EGFR restores the pH in the extracellular medium (p<0.05), \nthe lactate secretion (p<0.05) and the LDH expression and activi -\nty (p<0.05) in CF cells. In conclusion, our results confirmed that a \nconstitutive EGFR activation is partially involved in the regulation \nof pHe, lactic acid secretion and LDH expression and activity by \nthe CFTR channel. The low pH microenvironment observed in CF \ncells could interfere with immunological functions and promote the \nestablishment of infections in patients with CF.
