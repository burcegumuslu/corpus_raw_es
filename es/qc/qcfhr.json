INTRODUCTION  \nIn recent years, Chilean courts have seen an explosion of criminal \nprosecutions for serious human rights violations committed during the country\u2019s \ndictatorship, which spanned 1973 to 1990. At the same time, international courts \nhave seen the rebirth of the  field of international criminal law through the works \nof the ad hoc  tribunals,1 hybrid courts, and the International Criminal Court \n(ICC). These courts have produced a bevy of judicial decisions fleshing out the \ncontours of international criminal law (ICL) and the Rome Statute, the treaty \ncreating the ICC and a template of ICL.2  This Article examines the use of ICL, \nin particular the ICL of the ICC, in the post -Pinochet human rights trials in Chile.   \nDrawing on a review of Chilean judicial decisions and case materials, \ninterviews with judges, lawyers, academics, and human rights gr oups in Chile, \nthe Article concludes that ICL has played a role in Chilean human rights \nprosecutions by bolstering arguments to remove hurdles, particularly the \n \n1 The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda are known as \u201cad hoc tribunals\u201d due to their temporally -\nconstrained and conflict -specific mandate. UNITED NATIONS INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL \nTRIBU NAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA , https://www.icty.org (last visited Oct. 30, 2019) \n(noting that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda are known as \u201cad hoc tribunals\u201d due to their temp orally -\nconstrained and conflict -specific mandate); UNITED NATIONS INTERNATIONAL RESIDUAL \nMECHANISM FOR CRIMINAL TRIBUNALS , https://unictr.irmct.org (last visited Oct. 30, 2019)  \n2 The Rome Statute states that it should not be read to limit interpretation of  ICL elsewhere, \nbut it nevertheless offers one easily -consulted statement of ICL translated into a wide variety of \nlanguages, including Spanish. Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, art. 10, July 18, \n1998, 2187 U.N.T.S. 90 [hereinafter Rome St atute] (\u201cNothing in this part shall be interpreted as \nlimiting or prejudicing in any way existing or developing rules of international law for purposes \nother than this Statute.\u201d).  The ICC expanded on the ICL definitions set out in the Rome Statute \nin the c ompanion document, the Elements of Crimes. Rep. of the Prep. Comm. for the Int\u2019l Crim. \nCourt, Addendum: Finalized Draft Text of the Elements of Crimes, U.N. Doc. \nPCNICC/2000/1/Add.2 (2000) [hereinafter Elements of Crimes].  2019]  ICL by Analogy  3 \namnesty the regime conferred on itself and domestic statutes of limitations. Upon \nacknowledging  the crimes as crimes against humanity or war crimes, courts \ncould then invoke international law norms requiring states to prosecute and \npunish and prohibiting using amnesties or statute of limitation to block \nprosecutions for crimes against humanity. This  crimes against humanity \nargument was not the only argument presented in favor of allowing prosecutions \nto go forward, but it came to be a central one. Litigants and courts also invoked \nICL to reframe the crimes in order to argue for \u201cproportional,\u201d meanin g greater, \npunishment. To a more limited degree, courts have engaged with ICL to help \ninterpret substantive legal questions about the meanings of crimes.  More \nrecently, defendants are turning to ICL to craft exculpatory arguments or, at least, \nto mitigate sentences.  \nThe Chilean courts\u2019 use of ICL in cases for dictatorship -era human rights \nviolations is in some ways a one -off. While the Geneva Conventions and the \nWorld War II tribunals preceded the crimes of the Chilean dictatorship, the Rome \nStatute of the ICC and even the modern ad hoc tribunals, the International \nCriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), post -date them. Thus, Chilean courts\u2019 \nuse of ICL, particularly ICL norms emanating fro m the ICC, to interpret \ndictatorship -era crimes will differ from how they might use it for crimes \ncommitted today. The legality principle complicates the use of law stemming \nfrom these courts, but has not precluded their use altogether. This article \nexamin es the ways Chilean courts have navigated these waters and used ICL to \ninform their decisions dealing with crimes that clearly rise to the level of \ninternational crimes.3 \nThe Chilean courts\u2019 use of ICL in domestic prosecutions for atrocity crimes \nwarrants  exploration due to Chilean courts\u2019 quite extensive experience in \nadjudicating atrocity cases and Chile\u2019s role on the world stage as a participant in \ninternational criminal justice efforts like the ICC. Chile, once a world \u201cleader\u201d \nin human rights abuses, arguably is now a world leader in domestic atrocity \nprosecutions. Despite a slow start, Chilean courts have extensively adjudicated \npast human rights abuses. Only Argentina leads Chile in the number of \nconvictions for dictatorship -era atrocities.4  In Chi le, there are some 1500 \n \n3 I use the term \u201cinternational c rimes\u201d here to signify acts that have been made crimes \nunder international law. See Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique M\u00e9gret, In Defense Of Hybridity: Towards A \nRepresentational Theory Of International Criminal Justice , 38 CORNELL INT'L L. J. 725, 733 \n(2005) (\u201cAt the substantive  level, we know that crimes are properly called \u2018international\u2019 by \nvirtue of their source and foundation being international. Crimes are international because they \nare proclaimed as such and according to the international community's modes of norm \nproducti on (treaty, custom). Thus international crimes are unmistakably international regardless, \nfor example, of the fact that they may also be incorporated into domestic law.\u201d).  \n4 Alexandra Huneeus , Judging from a Guilty Conscience: The Chilean Judiciary\u2019s Human  \nRights Turn , 35 LAW & SOC. INQUIRY  99, 100 (2010)  [hereinafter Judging from a Guilty \nConscience ] (noting that as of 2010, Chilean \u201c[j]udges ha [d] . . .  sentenced more former officials 4 University of California, Davis  [Vol. 26:1  \npending criminal cases for dictatorship era human rights violations, with some \n350 cases having reached final resolution.5  This number far eclipses the number \nof defendants tried before any international criminal tribunal.6 Chile  is also a \nplayer in international criminal justice efforts elsewhere. It participated in \nnegotiating the Rome Statute, the treaty creating the ICC, and is an ICC State \nParty.  An examination of Chilean caselaw therefore offers a look at the courts \nof a St ate Party turning to the ICC to guide its own domestic processes relating \nto past abuses. The use of ICL in Chilean courts likewise may be instructive for \nother jurisdictions dealing with human rights abuses in their own countries and \nfiguring out how to i ncorporate modern ICL arguments, even in the face of \nlegality constraints or tensions with domestic law.  Thus,  exploring the Chilean \ninvocations of ICL offers a comparative international law perspective from a \ncountry in the global south with significant e xperience in transitional justice \nmatters and engagement in international criminal justice efforts on the \ninternational level.7   \nPerhaps most importantly, examining the Chilean courts\u2019 use of ICL is \nilluminating for those concerned with optimizing intern ational criminal justice \nefforts. Due to the manifest inability of the ICC to adjudicate all international \ncrimes worldwide and the decentralized \u201ccomplementarity\u201d model upon which \nit is premised, the success of domestic forums in adjudicating human rights  \nabuses is perhaps the most important sign of the ICC\u2019s success.8 As Michael \nNewton notes, the \u201cRome Statute implicitly concedes that states will remain \n \nof the military regime than judges of any other country in Latin Ameri ca.\u201d).  As of November 2017, \nArgentine courts had convicted over 800 people for dictatorship -era crimes, with some 754 \npersons on trial.

First, to my knowledge, it is the first to explore the issue of \nlanguage and accessibility of ICC judgments and other materials in ensuring the \nefficacy of the Rome Statute\u2019s complementarity regime. Although there has been \nsome scholarsh ip on the challenges of in -court translation of witnesses at \ninternational criminal tribunals,10 scholars have overlooked the severe \nlimitations for norm dissemination inherent in ICL judicial decisions available \nin only two or three languages.  This articl e demonstrates that an important \ncontribution of international tribunals, NGOs or governments to international \ncriminal justice efforts would be the translation of important ICL judgments, \nwhether from international tribunals or national courts, in as many  languages as \npossible, particularly languages in countries where there are possible atrocity \ncrime trials on the horizon. Second, although there is a rich discussion on \nfragmentation of the law in the ICL literature,11 the literature has focused \nprincipal ly on fragmentation among and within different international courts. \n \n9 Michael Newton, Comparative Complementarity: Domestic Jurisdiction Consistent With  \nThe Rome Statute Of The International Criminal Court , 167 MIL.

Doc A/CN.4/L.682, Apr . 13, 2006, (hereinafter ILC \nFragmentation Report) for a discussion of the fragmentation of international law generally.  6 University of California, Davis  [Vol. 26:1  \nThis Article offers examples of fragmentation of ICL upon its use in a domestic \nlegal system and suggests a need to distinguish between conscious departures \nfrom or adaptations of the law  and errors.  \nFinally, this article adds a new and compelling argument for greater \nattention to regional human rights courts. Recently, regional human rights courts \nhave garnered some valuable scholarly attention.12 However, none of the \nscholarship, to my knowledge, has focused on the role, potential or realized, of \nregional human rights courts in distilling and translating ICL norms for domestic \ncourts. This article shows that the Inter -American Court of Human Rights has \nnot only, as Alexandra Huneeus has argued, played a quasi -criminal role by \nordering domestic jurisdictions to investigate and prosecute crimes and \nmonitor ing their progress, it also has played the role of flagging and distilling for \ndomestic courts relevant ICL norms.  \nThis Article proceeds  in three Parts. In an effort to contextualize the Chilean \nhuman rights prosecutions, the first Part offers a brief history of the Chilean \ndictatorship and subsequent efforts to address gross human rights violations from \nthe dictatorship.  The second Part sets out the research methodology \u2014case \nreview and interviews \u2014and describes findings on the different arguments for \nwhich courts and litigants deployed ICL. The third Part explores the implications \nof the Chilean experience for international criminal justic e from international \ntribunals . These include understanding the domestication of ICL as showing the \ntransformative value of ICL, but also its fluidity.  ICL, once it enters the domestic \nlegal arena, may be used in a variety of contexts and to support a var iety of \narguments, and not only those that favor accountability. ICL applied \ndomestically also may not look the same as the ICL of international courts. Some \nchanges may be intentional \u2014adaptation and innovation \u2014others less so. \nCritically,  the Chilean experience demonstrates the importance of the \naccessibility of ICL, in terms of dissemination, distillation and translation, in \norder for ICL to play a meaningful role in domestic jurisdictions grappling with \ngross human rights abuses and atroc ity crimes.  Relatedly, it shows the critical \nrole played by regional human rights bodies, such as the Inter -American Court \nof Human Rights, in introducing ICL norms and the utility of the ICC regime in \n \n12 See, e.g., Alexandra Huneeus, International Criminal Law by Other Means: The Quasi -\nCriminal Jurisdi ction of the Human Rights Courts , 107 AM.

BACKGROUND ON CHILEAN HUMAN RIGHTS PROSECUTIONS FOR \nDICTATORSHIP ERA CRIMES  \nIn order to set the stage for an examination of the use of ICL in the Chilean \nhuman rights prosecutions, this Part offers a very brief sketch of the events that \ngave rise to gross human rights violations in Chile and the transitional justice \ncontext giving rise to contemporary human rights prosecutions.  \nOn September 11, 1973, a U.S. -backed military junta ousted \ndemocratically -elected President Salvador Allende.13  In short order, General \nAugusto Pinochet became the dominant figure of the junta.14 After the coup, \nagents of the new government rounded up all potential opponents, including, \namong others, members of the former Allende government, socialists, \ncommunists , union -leaders,  and student leaders.15 Many were executed. Others \nsent into exile.16 Still others were taken to detention and torture centers. Helping \nthe government in this repressive enterprise were various security organs, \nincluding, as of 1974 the Di recci\u00f3n Nacional de Inteligencia (known as the \nDINA).17 Although most of the worst human rights abuses occurred in the \nimmediate wake of the coup and during the term of the DINA, but human rights \nabuses including enforced disappearances, political executions, torture, and \nsexual violence persisted throughout P inochet\u2019s rule.18  \nDuring the dictatorship, the judicial system did next to nothing to protect \nvictims of the regime. As Cath Collins notes: \u201c[t]he judiciary\u2019s single most \nglaring omission was its stubborn rejection of habeas corpus complaints.

English courts found that \nPinochet was not immune from prosecution, but Pinochet was ultimately \npermitted to return to Chile based on his purported poor health.32 (His triumphant \nwalk off the plane seemed to suggest a somewhat more robust version of the \nformer dictator than had been presented in the U.K. courts .33) As part of its \nopposition to Pinochet\u2019s extradition to Spain, however, Chile had argued that \nChilean cour ts would prosecute Pinochet themselves.34 Thus, Pinochet\u2019s arrest \nin London put an international spotlight on Chilean domestic prosecutions for \nhuman rights abuses.  \nInternational scrutiny notwithstanding, the early 2000s saw some judges \nmoving forward wit h investigations while many others continued to dismiss \ncases based on the regime\u2019s self -amnesty and statutes of limitation.35 The judge \nassigned to the Caravan of Death case against Pinochet, Judge Juan Guzm\u00e1n, \nassiduously investigated the cases against P inochet, despite his conservative \nbackground and in the face of significant political pressure domestically. The \ncase eventually ended with the Court of Appeals of Santiago deciding that \nPinochet was unfit to stand trial, but litigants at least had the sat isfaction of seeing \nPinochet stripped of official immunity, indicted and detained.36 In 2001, the \nSupreme Court gave nine ministers a docket made up exclusively of human \nrights cases, with another 51 judges giving priority to human rights cases.37  \n \n31 Interview with Lawyer, Consejo de Defensa del Estado in Santiago, Chile (Nov. 20, \n2017) (noting that \u201cthe Geneva Conventions  have been funda mental\u201d because they were the \n\u201conly conventions to which Chile had subscribed\u201d/ \u201clas Convenciones de Giniebra han sido \nfundamentales [porque eran] los u\u0301nicos convenios suscritos en Chile\u201d and that they were \u201cmore \nconvincing because they were already law\u201d/ \u201cma\u0301s convencentes porque ya era ley\u201d)  (notes on \nfile with author) .  \n32 NAOMI ROHT-ARRIAZA , THE PINOCHET EFFECT : TRANSNATIONAL JUSTICE IN THE  \nAGE OF HUMAN RIGHTS , 63-64 (2005) (discussing Jack Straw\u2019s decision to permit Pinochet to \nreturn to Chile on health grounds).  \n33 See id. at 67 -68 (\u201cPinochet descended from the plane.

In the Sandoval Rodriguez  case, the court noted \nthat the aggravated kidnapping charges amounted to the international crime of \nenforced disappearance and, since aggravated kidnapping is an ongoing crime \nuntil a person has been found, dead or alive, the amnesty did not apply (since it \ncovered crimes only up until 1978) and the statute of limitations could not toll.38 \nThis rationale had its limitations, as it applied only to cases of enforced \ndisappearance and not to executions or torture.  \n2005 saw a step backward for human rights cases when the Supreme Court \nretreated from its holding in Poblete Cordoba . In a case of  extrajudicial \nexecution of 22 -year-old and 15 -year-old students, the court found that there had \nbeen no armed conflict in Chile during the dictatorship and thus the Geneva \nConventions did not apply. It then dismissed the homicide case on statute of \nlimita tion grounds. 39 \nIn 2006, the pendulum swung again. The Inter -American Court of Human \nRights (Inter -American Court) gave the Chilean judiciary another big push to \nadvance on human rights cases. In an embarrassment to Chilean courts and the \ngovernment, the Inter-American Court found Chile in violation of the Inter -\nAmerican Convention on Human Rights (American Convention) based on its \nfailure to prosecute those responsible for killing Mr. Almonacid in Almonacid v. \nChile .40 The court held that Chile had an obl igation to prosecute and that statutes \nof limitation and self -granted amnesties were not valid barriers to prosecution of \nwar crimes or crimes against humanity under international criminal and human \nrights law. Later, in Garcia Lucero , the Inter -American C ourt held that Chile had \nbreached its obligations to investigate facts and identify and, as appropriate, \npunish those responsible (whether or not a victim or victim\u2019s family member \nasks for it).41 \nScholars debate the leading cause of Chilean courts\u2019 openin g to criminal \nprosecutions, and many emphasize that international pressure is not the only \n \nHumanos en Chile 2018 55 (Tom\u00e1s Vial eds., 1 st ed., 2018) (noting the consolidation of human \nrights cases to five  judges but that, in 2018, thirteen judges in Chile issued judgments in \ndictatorship -era human rights cases).  \n38 See Corte Suprema de Justicia [C.S.J.] [Supreme Court], 17 noviembre 2004, \u201cCaso \nMiguel \u00c1ngel Sandoval Rodr\u00edguez,\u201d Rol de la causa: 517 -2004; See also UDP,  supra note 37, \nat 7-8. \n39 See Corte Suprema de Justicia [C.S.J.] [Supreme Court], 4 agosto 2005, \u201cCaso Ricardo \nRioseco y Luis Cotal,\u201d Rol de la  causa: 457 -2005; UDP,  supra note 37, at 7 -8. \n40 Almonacid -Arellano v.

First, \nsurvivors or family members of deceased victims can file criminal complaints \n(querellas).45 Judges may also open investigations sua sponte .46 Finally, the \nHuman Rights Program of the Ministry of Justice, formerly of the Ministry of \nInterior, may initiate cases through criminal complaints.47 After a complain t or \non their own initiative, the judge investigates and, if there is enough evidence, \n \n42 Judging from a Guilty Conscience , supra  note 4, at 136 (noting that among explanations \ngiven for why courts became more receptive to human rights cases are \u201cinternational pressure, \nexecutive leadership (coupled with judicial deference), ci vil society, and institutional change \nwithin the judiciary\u201d but arguing that the real reason was the Chilean judiciary\u2019s desire for \nredemption after its gross failings in protecting the rule of law and human rights during the \ndictatorship).  \n43 CENTRO DE DERECHOS HUMANOS (UDP) , INFORME ANUAL SOBRE DERECHOS \nHUMANOS EN CHILE 2017  (2017) ,  \nhttp://www.derechoshumanos.udp.cl/derechoshumanos/images/InformeAnual/2017/1 -\nverdad,%20justicia,%20reparaci\u00f3n%20y%20memoria.pdf  (\u201cEl Poder Judicial inform\u00f3 que al 4 \nde septiem bre de 2017, exist\u00eda un total de 1.328 causas penales por cr\u00edmenes contra los DDHH \nen tramitaci\u00f3n (1.005 de ellas en estado de sumario, 132 en plenario, 191 falladas al menos en \nprimera instancia, pero sin ejecutoriarse, habiendo a\u00fan posibles  apelaciones o  casaciones \npendientes), a cargo de 15 ministros en visita, siete de ellos para Santiago.).  \n44 Chile enacted a new procedural code, which was gradually rolled out from 2000 to 2005, \nthat incorporated more features of the adversarial system and eliminated th is single judge \nproceeding.

By reframing \ndomestic crimes as war crimes and, later, crimes against humanity, courts could \ninvoke international norms that prohibit using self -serving amnesties or statutes \nof limitations as a barrier to prosecution for grave international crimes. Litigants \nand courts later employed the same reframing device to argue for proportional \npunishment and reparations. ICL and the ICC were also invoked in a variety of \nways to discuss principles of retroactivity. Finally, litigants and , in a few \ninstances , courts invoked ICL to justify addressing previously overlooked forms \nof wrongdoing, such as sexual violence. Courts also used ICL and the Rome \nStatute as a rhetorical device to emphasize the gravity of the crimes and the \nimportance of the rights at stake.  \nSome invocations of ICL and the Rome Statute are defendant -friendly. \nJudges justifying the dismissal of criminal cases for dictatorship -era human \nrights violations, also invoked ICL for a host of reasons. In particular, in scores \nof decisions, a few Supreme  Court judges, first in the majority, later in the \nminority, cited the Rome Statute\u2019s definition of an internal armed conflict as \nillustrative support for the proposition that Chile was not in armed conflict during \nthe dictatorship, meaning that the Geneva  Conventions did not apply and \ntherefore domestic statutes of limitations did. The very same judges would then \nargue that the Rome Statute\u2019s norms on the inapplicability of statutes of \nlimitation to international crimes did not apply, because the Rome Stat ute and \nthe Chilean legislation implementing it post -dated the crimes. Defendants and \ncourts have also invoked ICL for the proposition that minors are not prosecuted \nat the ICC (and therefore defendants who were minors at the time also ought not \nto be in C hile), that ICL on command responsibility precludes liability in their \ncases, and for reductions in punishment.  \nThe vast majority of the cases discussing ICL or the ICC dealt with \ndictatorship -era human rights abuses, but a few are contemporary cases. In t hese \ncases, courts have recast cases as crimes against humanity and invoked the ICL \ndoctrine of command responsibility to justify prosecution or extradition. \nDefendants in contemporary drug trafficking and bankruptcy cases in turn have \nalso invoked ICL to argue against alleged retroactive application of laws, to \njustify application of the rule of lenity, and to attempt to inject a gravity \nrequirement into cases.  \nA. Methodology  \nThis Article\u2019s examination of the role of ICL in the Chilean human rights \nprosecu tions relies on a review of Chilean judicial decisions and interviews \nconducted in Chile.  First, I collected all decisions available on Westlaw Chile \nusing the terms \u201cderecho penal internacional\u201d (international criminal law) or 2019]  ICL by Analogy  15 \n\u201cCorte Penal Internacional\u201d  (International Criminal Court). As of July 2018,52 \nthe term \u201cderecho penal internacional\u201d yielded 58 judicial decisions (excluding \none case captured which was a decision of the Inter -American Court and \nduplicate decisions). As of July 2018, the term \u201cCort e Penal Internacional\u201d \nappeared in 151 decisions (excluding two Inter -American Human Rights Court \ndecisions and duplicates).53 I then reviewed the decisions to ascertain how and \nwhy ICL or the ICC were being invoked.  The breakdowns offered below are not \nintended as quantitative analysis but rather represent an attempt to give a rough \nsense of the contours of the ICL arguments fo und in Chilean caselaw. It bears \nnoting that, although Westlaw\u2019s coverage of appellate decisions in the human \nrights cases purports to be quite comprehensive, its coverage of trial judgments \nis almost certainly underinclusive.54 \nTo supplement my reading of  Chilean caselaw, I conducted interviews of \nattorneys involved in human rights cases, including private attorneys who \nrepresent or have represented family members and survivors, government \nattorneys from several different offices,55 and lawyers from the fe minist human \nrights organization, Corporaci\u00f3n Humanas. I also interviewed Court of Appeals \njudges sitting by special designation as human rights judges (Ministros de visita), \nlocated throughout the country,56 as well as three justices of the Chilean Suprem e \n \n52 The author\u2019s access to Westlaw Chile though the Univer sity of Chile\u2019s library worked \nonly in Chile and ended in July 2018.   \n53 I was unable to do a search for the terms \u201cinternational criminal law\u201d or \u201cinternational \ncriminal court\u201d because Westlaw Chile does not permit the \u201cor\u201d function. Cross -referencing \nbased on date, case number and parties revealed thirteen decisions that appeared on both the ICL \nlist and the ICC list: one from 2002 in which the Constitutional Court addressed the \nconstitutionality of the Rome Statute, one first instance decision from 2006 in Santiago, one \nSupreme Court decision and one Santiago Court of Appeals decision from 2007, two Supreme \nCourt decisions from 2008, two Supreme Court decisions from 2009, one Supreme Court \ndecision from 2010, one Constitutional Court decision from 2015, o ne Supreme Court decision \nfrom 2016, one Supreme Court decision and one Constitutional Court decision from 2017.  \n54 Email from Denise Lizana, Key Account Manager, Thomas Reuters, to Caroline \nDavidson, Author (Oct. 3, 2018) ( notes on file with author ) (discu ssing coverage of Westlaw \nChile which was comprehensive when it came to appellate decisions, but limited on first instant \ndecisions) (\u201cLas sentencias de DDHH se suben en un alto porcentaje, por su importancia.

Thus, their view s \nshould not be taken as indicative of any kind of a Chilean consensus on any point. \nNevertheless, they offer useful insider perspectives o n the role ICL has played in \nthe prosecution for dictatorship -era human rights abuses in Chile.  \nB. Views of Interviewees on the Role of ICL  \nInterviewees had differing views on the centrality of ICL to the Chilean \nprosecutions.  Some believed that ICL had played a critical role in bringing about \nprosecutions. As one Supreme Court Justice explained:  \nWe were a long time with the reality that nobody was going to get \npunished. We didn't have a way to solve it. Then somebody \nthought of international law \u2014\"This i s called crimes against \nhumanity. \u201d Article 5 of the Constitution, paradoxically \nintroduced by Pinochet, says that the state should respect all \ninternational treaties.59  \nBy contrast, another Supreme Court Justice said judges did not need to look to \nICL, at  least to find applicable crimes, since the acts were criminal under \n \ninterviewed three Supreme Court justices. See Interview with SC1, Justice, Supreme Court of \nChile, in Santiago, Chile (June 2018); Interview with SC2, Justice, Supreme Court of Chile, in \nSantiago, Chile (May 2018); and Interview with SC3, Justice, Supreme Court of Chile, in \nSantiago, Chile (Mar. 2018 ).

Most found it to be a \nsomewhat he lpful framing tool. One government human rights lawyer cautioned \nthat the role of international law in Chilean law is not entirely clear. With \ninternational law, the lawyer explained , \u201cit depends on the judge you get and \ntheir receptivity\u2026 But it\u2019s notable \u2014there is more receptivity with this type of \ncase, otherwise the statute of limitation would apply. We can\u2019t deny it.61  Another \nhuman rights lawyer argued that ICL \u201chas been good for something. It\u2019s one \nmore tool \u2026 that permits understanding of the partic ipation.\u201d62 This lawyer \nindicated  that it is useful in the criminal complaints \u201ceven if it doesn\u2019t appear, it \nhelps you to go configuring a concept that in Chilean law does not exist, giving \nit content. In court, I don\u2019t know if it has helped much.\u201d63 Human rights lawyer, \nCristian Cruz, stated that ICL played \u201ca relevant role. The judge uses it as a \ntool.\u201d64 From the perspective of the state, a lawyer from the Consejo de la \nDefensa del Estado, explained: \u201cthe state invokes it as obiter dicta to show th at \nthe state is trying to comply [with international obligations].\u201d65 \nVeteran human rights lawyer, Eduardo Contreras gave ICL more credit.  He \nviewed ICL as critical to the Chilean human rights prosecutions \u2014\u201cnothing that \nis happening today in Chile on thes e issues would have occurred if ICL did not \nexist.\u201d66  He explained that around 2000 to 2001, when Pinochet was in London, \n\u201cjudges began to talk for the first time about the principles of international \nlaw.\u201d67 Contreras noted that human rights lawyers happ ened upon the \ninternational  law argument when a friend brought him a copy of the Geneva \nConventions, and he started leafing through it. He added: \u201cICL opened the door \n \n60 SC2, supra  note 56. \n61 Interview with Human Rights Lawyer, formerly of the Human Rights Program, Ministry \nof the Interior, i n Santiago, Chile (Oct. 17, 2017) (noting arguments over the interpretation of \nArticle V of the Constitution and stating \u201cdepende del  juez que te toca y la receptividad.\u201d Pero \nes \u201cnotable \u2014[hay] m\u00e1s receptividad en este tipo de causa, sino serian prescripta s.

One human rights judge explained that there was an evolution \nin caselaw. In the first judgments, you could see that international law, was not \n\u201cspecified,\u201d but \u201cwith time i t became a consideration.\u201d69  Later on, he explained, \nICL came to be seen as \u201cjus cogens.\u201d70  He said, \u201cwe are heading toward \ndomestic criminal law informed by international  criminal  law.\u201d71 As for the \nGeneva Conventions and the Rome Statute, he says \u201cit\u2019s not debated. They are \napplicable.\u201d72   \nThus, judges and lawyers interviewed viewed ICL as something between a \nuseful additional tool and an essential ingredient in the Chilean human rights \nprosecutions. The case analysis below offers a closer look at how judges \nincorporated ICL arguments.  \nC. Breakdown of Cases  \nAs the table below shows, of the fifty -eight decisions in the \u201cjurisprudencia\u201d \n(caselaw) database of Westlaw Chile using the term \u201cint ernational criminal law,\u201d \ntwenty -eight were Supreme Court cases.73 Three were decisions from the \nConstitutional Court. Fourteen came from the Court of Appeals of Santiago. Five \nappeared in decisions from various courts of appeals around the country, and \neight appeared in decisions of first instance judges.74 The number of decisions \nciting ICL more than doubled in 2006, the year the Inter -American Court issued \nits decision in Almonacid v. Chile . References to ICL tapered off in 2010, but \nmay have been replac ed with increased discussion of the Rome Statute, as seen \nbelow.  \n \n \n \n68 Id. (\u201c[N]os abri\u00f3 la puerta el derecho penal internacional . . .). Contreras is including \nGeneva Conventions -based arguments in his conception of ICL, thus his comments arguably \nspeak more to the utility of international humanitarian law and ICL in conjunction  than to ICL \nalone.  \n69 Minister 1, supra  note 57 (\u201c[N]o se especificaba \u2026 [con el] tiempo se fue decantando\u201d).  \n70Jus cogens  norms are peremptory norms  of international law.

Notably, \nalmost as frequent as pro -accountability arguments to circumvent the amnesty \nand statutes of limitation are pro -defendant arguments citing the Rome Statute to \nsupport the claim that there was not a non -international armed co nflict in Chile \nat the time of the crimes (and therefore the Geneva Conventions do not apply \nand thus there is no obligation to prosecute under international law) and that the \nRome Statute could not be applied retroactively to the dictatorship -era human \nrights violations.  \n \nFigure 3 REFERENCES TO \u201cDERECHO PENAL INTERNACIONAL\u201d AND \u201cCORTE \nPENAL INTERNACIONAL\u201d IN WESTLAW CHILE JURISPRUDENCIA THROUGH \nJULY 2018 BY ARGUMENT   \nARGUMENTS IN DECISIONS INVOKING \u201c INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW \u201d \n(DERECHO PENAL INTERNACIONAL)*  \nDefinition of crimes against humanity  8 \nStatute of Limitations/Amnesty  32 \nRetroactivity  15 \nDuty to punish/ensure respect for human rights  10 \nGravity/proportionality  6 \nModes of participation  2 \n*These figures do not match the number of cases, because several cases invoked ICL for multiple \narguments.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2019]  ICL by Analogy  23 \nARGUMENTS IN DECISIONS INVOKING \u201c INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT \u201d \n(CORTE PENAL INTERNACIONAL)*  \n \nDefinition of crimes against humanity  36 \nStatute of Limitations/Amnesty  41 \nRetroactivity (pro -complainant)  2 \nDuty to punish/ensure respect for human rights  4 \nGravity/proportionality  8 \nModes of participation  0 \nRetroactivity (pro -defendant)  42 \nLack of Non-International Armed Conflict (pro -defendant)  37 \n*These figures do not match the number of cases, because several cases invoked the ICC for \nmultiple arguments.  \n \nThe next Part explores the different invocations of ICL and the ICC in \ngreater detail. As Part D reveals, ICL\u2019s crimes against humanity doctrine has \nfigured prominently in Chilean discussions of ICL, but courts have turned to ICL \nand the Rome Statute to bolster a variety of other arguments rooted in \ninternational human rights law (\u201cIHRL\u201d) and domestic law too.  \nD. The Crimes Against Humanit y Overlay  \nThe principal way in which ICL has entered the Chilean human rights \nprosecutions is through the concept of \u201clesa humanidad\u201d (crimes against \nhumanity).  Courts convict for a domestic crime but note that the acts amount to \ncrimes against humanity u nder ICL. This reframing has been used to a number \nof ends. First and foremost, by reframing the acts as crimes against humanity, \ncourts fold in international norms requiring investigation, prosecution, and \npunishment, which supplies a justification for ig noring the amnesty and statutes \nof limitation. The crimes against humanity gloss has also been used to support \narguments for proportional punishment and against the Chilean doctrine of \n\u201cmedia prescripci\u00f3n\u201d (partial statute of limitation), to justify civil reparations, \nand as a general rhetorical tool for emphasizing the gravity of offenses.  \nIt is worth noting that crimes against humanity is a concept that is invoked \neven without discussion of the terms \u201cinternational criminal law\" or the ICC. \nWhile there ar e some 220 decisions on Westlaw Chile citing \u201cinternational 24 University of California, Davis  [Vol. 26:1  \ncriminal law\u201d or \u201cInternational Criminal Court,\u201d there are over 700 decisions \nusing the term \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d78  This discrepancy indicates that \nthere are a large number of decisions in which Chilean courts are invoking the \nconcept of crimes against humanity without tethering it to any discussion of ICL \nas a field or the Rome Statute.79  \n1. Defining Crimes Against Humanity  \nCourts frequently invoked ICL and the ICC to define crimes against  \nhumanity.80 Courts cited the ICL or the ICC as part of discussions on the \nelements of crimes against humanity. In particular, courts cited ICL or the ICC \nfor the requirements that the act be committed as part of a widespread or \nsystematic attack with know ledge of the attack, or for the types of acts that can \namount to a crime against humanity.81 \nA recent Supreme Court case finding that a police officer\u2019s shooting of the \nvictim for violation of the curfew laws constituted a crime against humanity cited \nthe Rome Statute\u2019s definition of the crime, noting the requirements for a \nwidespread or systematic attack and a state policy, as the hallmarks of crimes \nagainst humanity. The court found both to be met, as the shooting was part of a \n\u201cstate policy of repression  of political views contrary to the regime, that \nauthorized use of firearms, the terrorizing of civilians, and, above all, the \nguarantee of impunity that the regime generated regarding criminal \nresponsibility and of all rules, among other conduct. \u201d82 However, as discussed in \n \n78 A search for the term \u201clesa humanidad\u201d in the Westlaw Chile caselaw (jurisprudencia) \ndatabase on May 25, 2018 yielded 718 results. An excellent thesis written by two University of \nChile law students, now graduates, offers a helpful taxonomy of the Chilean courts use of the \nconcept of crimes against humanity (lesa humanidad) in cases from 2006 to 2013. See Maria \nFernanda Gil  Herrera & Valentina Manzur Toro, Cr\u00edmenes de lesa Humanidad en Chile: \nSistematizaci\u00f3n de Argumentos de los Fall os Emitidos Por los Tribunales Superiores del Pa\u00eds \n(2006 -2013) (Aug. 2017) (unpublished thesis) (on file with the author).  \n79 Some of these cases may include citations to other modern international tribunals, but \nlikely not all. A search of Westlaw Chile us ing the term, Yugoslavia, for example, yielded only \n64 decisions, of which more than half appeared in the searches for the terms ICL and ICC \ncaptured in this study.   \n80 Eight of fifty -eight cases using the term ICL discuss the ICL definition of crimes agai nst \nhumanity, in particular the requirement of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian \npopulation and the types of acts that constitute crimes against humanity, such as murder and \nextermination. 36 of 158 cases using the term ICC invoke the Ro me Statute\u2019s definition of \ncrimes against humanity.  \n81 Corte Suprema de Justicia [C.S.J.] [Supreme Court], 19 junio 2018, \u201cUnidad del  \nPrograma de Derechos Humanos de la Subsecretar\u00eda de Derechos Humanos y ostros c.

In a relatively early citation to ICL from 2006, the \nCourt of Appeals of Santiago cited Article 7 of the Rome Statute, along with \nhuman ri ghts conventions, for the proposition that \u201cenforced disappearance is a \ngrave offense against the intrinsic dignity of the person.\u201d 83 The court then noted \nthat the Rome Statute\u2019s definition of crimes against humanity included murder, \nextermination, and en forced disappearance.84  \nCourts\u2019 articulation of ICL does not always track most commonly \nunderstood ICL doctrine. In the Villa Grimaldi mega -case, for example, the trial \njudge stated that the 2009 Chilean legislation incorporating the Rome Statute into \nChilean law recognized that , \u201c[T]here is a general agreement on the inhumane \nacts that constitute crimes against humanity, which are essentially the same as \nthose recognized for almost 80 years.

Apartheid, \nfor example, is a crime against humanity recognized by the R ome Statute, but \nnot by the statutes of the ad hoc tribunals.88  \nSince its passage, courts now often cite Chile\u2019s law incorporating, more or \nless,89 Rome Statute crimes into domestic law in addition to the Rome Statute. \nIn the Villa Grimaldi case, for exam ple, the court cited the Chilean legislation \nfor a list of crimes that can amount to crimes against humanity, even though the \nlegislation, like the Rome Statute, does not apply retroactively to dictatorship -\nera offenses:  \n[T]he practice of systematic or lar ge-scale killings, torture, \nenforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, the reduction to a \nstate of servitude or forced labor, persecution for political, racial, \nreligious or ethnic reasons, rapes and other forms of sexual abuse \nand arbitrary deportation or forced transfer of populations have \nbeen considered crimes against humanity. 90 \nThus, Chilean courts have cited the Rome Statute, as well as the domestic \nlegislation implementing it, to illustrate the types of crimes that constitute crimes \nagainst humanity, even though these instruments post -date the crimes.  \n2. Avoiding the Amnesty and Statute of Limitation  \nICL, in  conjunction with international humanitarian law (\u201cIHL\u201d) and IHRL, \nhas served as a central justification for ignoring domestic statutes of limitation \nand the Chilean amnesty law, which remains on the books.

First, \njudges tried to at least name perpetrators (the truth commissions had detailed \nabuses but had not identified perpetrators) and expose deeds even if they could \nnot be sentenced. Starting in 1998, the \u201cprevailing doctrine\u201d was that \u201ccrimes \nmust be  specified, and perpetrators identified, before amnesty can be properly \napplied.\u201d91 A few prosecutions even made it to sentencing.  As Cath Collins has \nobserved, courts initially \u201cfocused on cases where [the amnesty] didn\u2019t apply,\u201d92 \nincluding the prosecut ion of agents involved in the assassination of Orlando \nLetelier in Washington, DC. Courts then moved to crimes from the 1980s which \nfell outside of the timeframe of the amnesty. Later, courts created exceptions, for \nexample, relying on the ongoing crime th eory for kidnapping.93  \nAs noted above, in Poblete Cordoba , the Supreme Court justified ignoring \nthe amnesty and statute of limitations based on Chile\u2019s obligations under the \nGeneva Conventions to prosecute and punish war crimes, but retreated from this \nposition in 2005. Until around 2009, Chilean courts (and eve n the Supreme Court \nitself, since differently composed chambers would reach different results) went \nback and forth on the applicability of the Geneva Conventions.94 At least early \non, Chilean courts invoked the Geneva Conventions directly and argued its \napplicability as an IHL and IHRL norm, not one of ICL, even though grave \nbreaches of the Geneva Conventions also violate ICL. In Poblete Cordoba , for \nexample, the court never uses the term ICL and nor does it cite to the statutes or \ncaselaw of any internatio nal criminal tribunal. In these early cases, courts may \nhave been unaware of developments in ICL at the ICC or other modern \ninternational criminal tribunals or, more likely, simply chose to ground their \ndecisions in pre -existing IHL norms out of concern ov er retroactive application \nof ICL.95   \nEventually, however, courts began to use ICL to reframe the crimes as \u201clesa \nhumanidad\u201d (crimes against humanity) in order to justify non -application of the \namnesty and statute of limitations, particularly following th e Inter -American \nCourt decision in Almonacid  condemning Chile  for its failures in ensuring justice \nfor Mr. Almonacid .

Chile, Preliminary Objections, Merits, Reparations and Costs, 28 University of California, Davis  [Vol. 26:1  \nAlmonacid was a crime against humanity.97 In addition, the Inter -American \nCourt found that crimes against humanity are not subject to statutes of \nlimitations, and that, under internationa l law and the American Convention, \nstates have an obligation to investigate, prosecute, and punish those who commit \ncrimes against humanity.98 Almonacid  itself cited not only United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions related to the ad hoc tribunals and t he Special Court \nfor Sierra Leone, but also caselaw from Nuremberg and the ICTY in support of \nits arguments.99   \nChilean courts began relying on the ICL crimes against humanity rationale \nin addition to the Geneva Convention and continuing crime theories.  Of the fifty -\neight cases using the term ICL on Westlaw Chile, thirty -two of them invoked \nICL for the proposition that ICL prohibited using amnesties or statutes of \nlimitation as barriers to prosecution for crimes against humanity. Of the 150 \ncases using th e term ICC, forty -one cases used it for the proposition that the \nRome Statute prohibits using the amnesty or statutes of limitations as barriers to \nprosecution for crimes within the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction, in particular crimes against \nhumanity. Some thirty -six of decisions cite the Rome Statute for the definition \nof crimes against humanity.100  \nE. Other Pro -Accountability ICL Arguments  \nOver time, courts began citing ICL and the Rome Statute for a wide array \nof arguments. These included arguments related to propo rtional punishment, a \n \nJudgment, Inter -Am. Ct. H.R. (ser. C) No. 154, \u00b6\u00b6 93 -101(Sept. 26, 2006)  (describing the \ngenesis of crimes against humanity in Nuremberg, sub sequent articulations of the doctrine and \ncaselaw of the European Court of Human Rights dealing with retroactivity issues).  \n97 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 103 -104 (\u201cAs it  is evident from the chapter of Proven Facts ( supra  paras. 82(3) to \n82(7)), between September 11, 1973 and M arch 10, 1990 Chile was ruled by a military \ndictatorship which, by developing a state policy intended to create fear, attacked massively and \nsystematically the sectors of the civilian population that were considered as opponents to the \nregime. This was ach ieved by a series of gross violations of human rights and of international \nlaw, among which there are at least 3,197 victims of summary executions and forced \ndisappearances, and 33, 221 detainees, most of whom were tortured. Likewise, the Court \nconsidered proven that the most violent time of that repressive period was that of the first months \nof the de facto government. Approximately 57 percent of all deaths and disappearances occurred \nduring the first months of the dictatorship. The execution of Mr. Almona cid-Arellano took place \nprecisely during that time. Considering the aforesaid, the Court determines that there is sufficient \nevidence to reasonably state that the extra -legal execution committed by State agents in \ndetriment of Mr. Almonacid -Arellano, who w as a member of the Communist Party and a \ncandidate to preside the said party, as well as the Provincial Secretary of the Central Unitaria de \nTrabajadores (Labor Central Union) and Magisterio (SUTE) Union Leader \u2013all of which was \nconsidered a threat to the d ictatorship doctrine \u2013was committed following a systematic and \ngeneralized pattern against the civilian population, and thus, it is a crime against humanity. \u201d) \n(internal citations omitted).  \n98 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 106-11. \n99 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 120 -27. \n100 See Figure 3, supra  Part III .C.  2019]  ICL by Analogy  29 \nright to reparations, special protection for minors, double jeopardy, legality (non -\nretroactivity), and expressing condemnation for the crimes. Using ICL to help \ninterpret domestic crimes proved less successful.  \n1. Proportionality of  Punishment  \nThe recasting of domestic crimes as crimes against humanity later was used \nto support arguments for proportional punishment, in particular to reject the \nChilean doctrine of \u201cmedia prescripci\u00f3n\u201d (partial statute of limitations). For \nseveral year s after courts began recognizing that, as crimes against humanity, the \ndictatorship -era crimes of kidnapping and murder could not be blocked by the \namnesty or statutes of limitations, they nevertheless gutted penalties based on a \ndomestic doctrine of \u201cmedi a prescripci\u00f3n.\u201d The Chilean criminal code contains \na provision that allows courts to reduce the grade of punishment for crimes \nprosecuted long after the commission of the offenses.101 For many people \nconvicted of dictatorship -era crimes, this doctrine mean t that their sentences, \nalready low due to inadequate domestic penalties (particularly for torture), would \nbe reduced such that they never spent any time in prison.102 \nFor years, the Supreme Court, with some dissenters, distinguished \u201cmedia \nprescripci\u00f3n\u201d from a statute of limitations, by arguing that it was a doctrine \nrelated to mitigation of punishment and, unlike a statute of limitations, did not \ncompletely extinguish criminal responsibility in contravention of ICL and \ninternational human rights norms.103 The dissenters, who later became the \nmajority, argued that the greater of prescripci\u00f3n (statute of limitations) included \nthe lesser of \u201cmedia prescripci\u00f3n\u201d and that, ju st as ICL and the Rome Statute \nprecluded the use of a statute of limitations in war crimes and crimes against \nhumanity cases, they also precluded reducing punishment on this basis. 104  As \n \n101 C\u1d0f\u0301\u1d05\u026a\u0262\u1d0f C\u026a\u1d20\u026a\u029f [C\u1d0f\u0301\u1d05.

Right to Reparations  \nThe use of ICL -based argu ments to support reparations have followed a \nsimilar trajectory. At first, courts resisted application of ICL norms to a new \ncontext, but eventually embraced ICL and ICC -based arguments to further \naccountability and reparation. Even after the Chilean Supre me Court consistently \nbegan to accept the principle that statutes of limitations could not serve as a \nbarrier to criminal prosecutions, the Supreme Court, and in particular the \nConstitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, rejected claims for civil \nindemnit y from the state for crimes against humanity. The Court found in \ndecision after decision, that the prohibition on using a statute of limitations as a \nbarrier to accountability for crimes against humanity and war crimes extended \nonly to criminal cases.109  \nSupreme Court Justice Sergio Mu\u00f1oz, who repeatedly dissented from the \nSupreme Court decisions that dismissed civil claims based on domestic statute \nof limitation grounds, argued that claims for civil indemnity ought to be viewed \nas arising out of the underl ying crimes against humanity.110 He also cited Article \n75 of the Rome Statute as evidence of an obligation under international law  to \nprovide reparations.111 Judges in the Court of Appeals of Santiago and Temuco \nin 2014 and 2015, also accepted the crimes ag ainst humanity argument to avoid \napplication of statute of limitations to civil claims relating to crimes against \nhumanity or war crimes.112 \nBy 2015, the argument invoking the prohibition on using statutes of \nlimitations to block civil cases involving claims rooted in crimes against \nhumanity and recognition of an obligation to provide reparations for crimes \nagainst humanity (citing as support Article 75 of the Rome Statue) beca me the \nmajority position of the Supreme Court.113 Several decisions thereafter repeated \nthis position.114 This change in tack coincided with a change in the chamber \n \n109 See, e.g. , Corte Suprema de Justicia [C.S.J.] [Supreme Court], 30 septiembre 2013, \n\u201cAbarzu\u0301a Rivadeneira Eduardo c.

This special protection, he contended, provides an additional  argument \nin support of reparations and the rejection of any statute of limitation for civil \ncrimes stemming from a crimes against humanity against a minor.116 As noted \nbelow in Part III(F), defendants have also made arguments invoking the Rome \nStatute for the special treatment of minors.  \n4. Avoiding Double Jeopardy  \nIn at least one case, a complainant represented by the government\u2019s Human \nRights Program argued against application of double jeopardy by analogy to the \nRome Statute.  In a prosecution for murder , the complainant argued that double \njeopardy ought not to bar another prosecution, because the previous case in the \nmilitary court had been for unlawful use of force rather than murder as a crime \nagainst humanity.  (The defendant had been convicted of unla wful use of force, \nbut his conviction had been overturned on appeal .) The complainant invoked \nArticle 20 of the Rome Statute for the proposition that a sham prosecution does \nnot bar another prosecution for crimes against humanity.  The relevant Rome \nStatute  provision addresses admissibility before the court, not double jeopardy, \nbut implicates double jeopardy,  since it provides that a prior domestic \nprosecution designed to shield a defendant from the ICC would not render a case \n \nde Justicia [C.S.J.] [Supreme Court], 29 junio 2016, \u201cAndr\u00e9s Pinto Nanjari c.

Interpretive Aid  \nThe importance of ICL as an interpretive tool is somewhat unclear. As noted \nabove, judges interviewed indicated that ICL, while not controlling, could serve \nas an interpretive aid. However , a review of caselaw in fact suggests that direct \nuse of ICL to interpret domestic crimes, as opposed to reframing them, was \ninfrequent and largely unsuccessful. 119  Judges may have used international law \nto guide their thinking on whether to adopt a narrow or expansive reading of a \ncrime or to assess potential penalties, but seldom did judges cite international law \nexplicitly to guide interpretations of domestic cri mes, defenses or theories of \nresponsibility.  \nOne justice of the Chilean Supreme Court explained that judges use \n\u201cdomestic law but when there is a very brutal contradiction,\u201d they look to \ninternational law.120 Similarly, one first instance human rights judge  explained \nthat judges can turn to international law for persuasive authority.121 The judge \nnoted that the Supreme Court had done a tremendous amount of work on the \ninternational legal principles and had largely sketched out the international law \nlandscape for lower courts.122 Another human rights judge likewise suggested \nthat ICL helped as a guide. Speaking in particular about the crime of torture, \nwhere the inadequacies in the Chilean law of the time are perhaps most acute,123 \nthe judge explained that the in ternational law on torture \u201cgave them an \n \n117 Rome Statute, supra note 2, art. 17(2) (\u201cIn order to determine unwillingnes s in a  \nparticular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the principles of due process \nrecognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as applicable: (a) \nThe proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national d ecision was made for the purpose \nof shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction \nof the Court referred to in article 5; (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings \nwhich in the circumstances is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice; \n(c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they \nwere or are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent wit h an \nintent to bring the person concerned to justice.\u201d).  \n118 Corte Suprema de Justicia [C.S.J.] [Supreme Court], 13 septiembre 2017 , \u201cAgrupaci\u00f3n  \nde Familiares de Ejecutados Pol\u00edticos y otros c.

In the Jorge \nGrez case, for example, the trial judge convicted scores of agents of aggravated \nkidnapping of Grez based on their membership in the DINA (the Chilean secret \npolice) and participatio n in the activities of the clandestine torture center, \nLondres 38, at the time of Grez\u2019s detention. Although the trial court decision \ndoes not explicitly invoke ICL doctrine on complicity or joint criminal enterprise \n(JCE), it employs a logic that is remin iscent of JCE. By participating in the \nactivities of the detention center, Londres 38, and the unit running it the agents \nwere responsible as principles or accomplice\u2019s for Grez\u2019s disappearance.126  This \nargument resembles joint criminal enterprise liabilit y, based on a system of \nmistreatment, as recognized at the ICTY and with origins in caselaw from \nNuremberg.127   \nThe Court of Appeals later rejected this reasoning and overturned the \nconvictions of forty -six of the convicted agents.128 The court found that \nbelonging to a particular organization, without evidence of actual participation \nin the torture or disappearance of Grez, was not sufficient to convict agents of \naggravated kidnapping.129 The court noted that perhaps the defendants could \n \n124 Minister 1, supra  note 57 (explaining that torture gave them a shape or template, \n\u201cfigura\u201d).  \n125 Interview with Francisco Jara Bustos, Human Rights Lawyer, in Santiago, Chile (Oct. \n20, 2017) (\u201cha servido para mostrar que tal to rtura es crimen\u201d)  (notes on file with author) . \n126 Corte de Apelaciones [C.

These findings are c onsistent with Naomi Roht -Arriaza\u2019s \ncontention that \u201cwhere international law is invoked in a [domestic] criminal \nsetting, it is often used for its norm -establishing and reaffirming value rather than \nas a basis for the precise statutory definitions required  for valid criminal \nconviction.\u201d132 \n6. Justification for Expansion into Other Crimes  \nAlthough it is not always apparent from the judgments, advocates also \ninvoke ICL to urge courts to address previously overlooked forms of abuses. The \nbriefs in cases involving sexual violence, for example, are replete with references \nto ICL norms on sexual violence and calls for courts to address the issue in their \njudgments.133   \nThis approach appears to have borne some fruit. After years of judicial \nneglect, Chilean c ourts have recently recognized sexual violence crimes as \ncrimes against humanity. In 2018, the Supreme Court overturned the dismissal \nof a case for civil indemnity on statute of limitations grounds. It held for the first \ntime held that rape was a crime aga inst humanity.134 The court stated that the \n \nel aparato represivo del Estado, pues en dicha l\u00f3gica, m\u00e1s bien parece que lo que se objeta es la \nexistencia misma de tal organizaci\u00f3n, atendida la inaudita e inadmisible finalidad para la cual \nfue creada, reproche que aunque puede naturalmente ser entendido, bastando para ello tener \n\u00fanicamente en cuenta la m\u00e1s elemental distinci\u00f3n entre lo bueno y lo malo, lo cierto es que de \naceptarse tal razonamiento en orden a hacer extensiva la responsabilidad personal en la \nperpetraci\u00f3n de un crimen en funci\u00f3n de las mencionadas consideraciones, podr\u00edamos incluso \nafirmar que tal factor de imputaci\u00f3n incumbe tambi\u00e9n hacerlo aplicable a todos quienes \nformaban parte de la administraci\u00f3n del Estado y, a\u00fan m\u00e1s, a la sociedad toda, qu e permaneci\u00f3 \nsilente e inactiva frente tal proceder il\u00edcito.\u201d).  \n130 Id. \u00b65. \n131 Interview with Magdalena Garc\u00e9s, Human Rights Lawyer, in Santiago, Chile (Nov. 8 \n& No. 30, 2017)  (notes on file with author) . \n132 Cf.

Retroactivity  \nCourt and litigants in Chilean human rights cases have invoked ICL in \nvarying and sometimes contradictory ways to grapple with the issue of legality \nand retroactive application of the law. At the time of the crimes, Chile did not \nhave domestic legislation that defined crimes against humanity or provided for \ntheir punishment. These retroactivity arguments are particularly salient in that \nChile has a very formal legalist tradition. Professor Paulina Vergara, a law \nprofessor at Universidad Cat\u00f3lica who worked as a young lawyer on the Rettig \nCommission, notes Chile is \u201ca very legalistic culture.\u201d137  Kenneth Gallant also \nranks Chile\u2019s legal system as among the world\u2019s strictest on the principle of \nnullum crimen sine lege .138 \nChilean courts have used the fact that conduct was both an international \ncrime and a domestic one, albeit not the exact same crime, at the time of its \ncommission as a sufficient basis to ensure respect for legality principles. For \nexample, in one case, the Court of Appeals for Santiago stated:  \nGiven the above reasoning, it follows that the crimes of \naggravated homicide committed against the persons of three \nvictims assassinated in the month of October of 1973 by state \nagents, the subject of these facts, can be classified as crimes \nagainst humani ty which, in the judgement of this Court, does not \n \n135 Corte Suprema de Justicia [C.S.J.] [Supreme  Court], 23 enero 2018, Rol de la causa: \n17900 -2014 (\u201cLa exigencia de la generalidad se satisface, como consta del Informe de la \nComisi\u00f3n Nacional sobre Prisi\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica y Tortura, dada la gran cantidad de mujeres que dijo \nhaber sido v\u00edctima de esta clase de ataques.

This, because \nthe facts in question \u2018crimes of war and crimes against humanity \nare already punishable at the moment of committing the alleged \nacts according to customary international law and also in \naccordance with internal law, with respect to aggravated \nhomicide.140 \nThus, a domestic crime plus a customary international law norm sufficed to \njustify reliance on ICL.  \nFinally, courts have also cited ICL and even the Rome Statute as evidence \nof a jus cogens , or customary international law norms, in particular the norm that \nwar crimes and crimes against humanity cannot be subject to a statute of \nlimitations. Effectively, courts have argued that even if Chile had not yet ratified \nthe Convention on No n-Applicability of Statutes of Limitations to War Crimes \nand Crimes Against Humanity at the time of the offenses, ICL, along with IHRL, \nhas made this a jus cogens  norm, or at least a general principle of international \nlaw that binds Chile.

Expressing Condemnation/Better Labelling  \nICL also fills an expressive function in the Chilean human rights \nprosecutions. This use of ICL is attractive, because it reaps some of the rhetorical \nbenefits of ICL without the retroactivity problems of relying directly on ICL. \nParticularly early on, the Supreme Court took pains to clarify that convictions \nwere not based on retroactive applications of international law, but rather \ndomestic law contextual ized by ICL. Nevertheless, some judges insisted on \nadding the international labels to offenses, even if just illustratively, in order to \nmore properly name the conduct and emphasize the gravity of the crimes.  \nIn a 2007 decision, the Supreme Court rejected a defendant\u2019s argument that \nhe was being subjected to retroactive punishment by highlighting the lower \ncourt\u2019s expressive purpose in invoking ICL:  \nRegarding the issue raised by the appellants, arguing that the \nappealed judgment applied legislation  not in force in our country \nat the time the crimes occurred, this should also be rejected, \nbecause the appeals judgement is not resting on these norms to \nconvict the accused, rather it is\u2026 [convicting] based on Article \n141 of the Criminal Code [aggravated  kidnapping], illustrating  \ntheir decision with the rules of the Inter -American Convention on \nEnforced Disappearance of Persons, the Declaration on the \nProtection of all persons against enforced disappearance, \nResolution 3.074 of the United Nations General Assembly of \nDecember 3, 1973, as well as the Statute of the International \nCriminal Court. 142  \n \n141 C.

The court explains that international law sources only \nserve to:  \n[S]how the importance of the crime committed and how, over \ntime, the idea of respecting individual liberty as a legal right of \nthe utmost importance, as well as the recognitio n of the life and \ndignity of person and who have the just and legitimate right to \nknow the resting place of those who were detained.144 \nThe invocation of international law, including ICL, serves to highlight the \nimportance of the rights and transgressions at stake. In another example, in a \njudgement in a case brought by torture survivors relating to abuse they suffered \nin the notorious torture center, Villa Grimaldi, the court referred to the crimes \nagain and again as \u201ctorture,\u201d not \u201capplicat ion of torments\u201d or \u201cillegitimate \npressure,\u201d the crimes for which the defendants were actually convicted.145 \nThis expressive use of ICL is made more important by the inadequate \ndomestic charges available in the Chilean criminal code at the time of the acts \nand, in many instances, the very light sentences imposed. Again, enforced \ndisappearance is charged as \u201csecuestro\u201d or \u201csecuestro calificado\u201d (kidnaping or \naggravated kidnapping), murder is \u201chomicidio simple\u201d or \u201chomicidio calificado\u201d \n(murder or aggravated m urder), and, worst of all, torture is \u201caplicaci\u00f3n de \ntormentas\u201d or \u201capremio ileg\u00edtimo\u201d (application of torments or illegitimate \npressure).

Many of the invocations favored accountability.  In \nparticular, courts reframed domestic crimes as crimes against humanity in order \nto avoid application of domestic barriers and to express more appropriate \ncondemnation of the ac ts than domestic crime categories and sentences \npermitted. They also invoked ICL to address concerns about retroactivity, ensure \nproportional punishment, justify reparations, and justify turning to previously \noverlooked categories of crimes, such as sexual  violence.  As the next Part \nreveals, however, not all invocations of ICL have favored accountability.  \nF. Defendant -Friendly Uses of ICL  \nDefendants and judges have also coopted ICL and the Rome Statute in \nsupport of arguments to dismiss human rights cases b ased on statute of \nlimitations or amnesty grounds or reduce punishment. In particular, they have \ncited the Rome Statute for arguments relating to the existence of a non -\ninternational armed conflict (to block arguments that there is an obligation to \nprosecu te and punish under the Geneva Conventions), retroactivity, the non -\nfulfillment of requirements for a crime against humanity, the defense of superior \norders, and mitigation of sentences.  \n1. No Armed Conflict  \nThe most frequent invocation of ICL that cuts in  favor of defendants (and \nagainst criminal accountability for human rights violations) appeared in \narguments that there was no internal armed conflict at the time of the crimes.  As \nnoted above, in 1998, the Supreme Court in Poblete Cordoba  invoked the \nGeneva Conventions for the proposition that Chile was obligated to prosecute \nand punish war crimes and thus could not apply domestic statutes of limitations \nor the amnesty. In decision after decision of the Supreme Court, for a time in the \nmajority and later in the dissent, certain justices of the Supreme Court, in \nparticular Justices  Ballesteros and Segura, argued that the requirements for a \nnon-international armed conflict were not met and that the Geneva Conventions \ntherefore did not apply.147   \n \n146 C\u00d3DIGO PENAL [C\u00d3D. PEN.] [criminal code], arts. 25, 141, 150. The complainant -\nappellant \u2019s argument was that the code provision for the crime of \u201capplication of torments\u201d was \nfor abuse of people serving a lawful sentence, and the tortured detainees her e were not lawfully \ndetained.

The justices contended that the \nRome Statute\u2019s norms on the non -applicability of statute of limitations to \ninternational crimes, like those  of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva \nConventions, did not apply because the Chilean Congress had not approved them \nat the time of the offenses.149     \n \n(affirming the acquittal based on the same argument that the Geneva Conventions did not apply \nand therefore the statute of limitation did and invoking the Rome Statute for the proposition that \ninternal disturbances  do not amount to a non -international armed conflict), with Corte Suprema \nde Justicia [C.S.J.] [Supreme Court], 29 septiembre 2009, \u201cLoreto Meza Van Den Daele y \nHerminia Soto Almonacid c.

Crimes Against Humanity Requirements Not Met  \nDefendants are starting to push harder on the requir ements of crimes against \nhumanity to avoid the statutes of limitations, amnesty , and other implications that \nlabel carries. A Supreme Court decision of June 25, 2018, noted the defendant\u2019s \nargument that his actions did not meet the standard of ICL for crim es against \nhumanity since they were not part of a widespread or systematic attack.150 The \ndefendant was the commander of a unit responding to a demonstration. He \nordered that they either shoot in the air or shoot directly at protesters if in danger. \nOne of his men shot and killed the victim. The defendant argued, unsuccessfully, \nthat his a cts were not part of a widespread or systematic attack. The defendant \ncited for support Article 7 of the Rome Statute and the Chilean legislation \nincorporating the Rome Statute into domestic law.151 \n3. Crimes Against Humanity Plus  \nAs noted above, Chilean co urts often recast domestic crimes as crimes \nagainst humanity to emphasize the gravity of the crimes. Defendants and judges \nat times have turned the gravity argument on its head by arguing that the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct was insufficiently grave to be a crimes  against humanity.  \nThis more essentialist conception of crimes against humanity has operated \nin defendant\u2019s favor by setting the bar higher than the strict legal requirements \nfor crimes against humanity.

But this issue became a matter of controversy: in the Tadic \njudgment, the ICTY imposed a discriminatory intent requirement for all crimes against humanity \nnotwithstanding the c ontrary language in the Statute, only to be reversed by the Appeals \nChamber. The corresponding definition in the ICTR Statute does require discriminatory intent \nfor crimes of both the murder and persecution types.

Superior Orders  \nPerhaps the most striking instance of ICL being invoked in a defendant\u2019s \nfavor appeared in the Endesa  case.163 The case involved the prosecution of three \ndefendants, including the head of a detention center, Walter Klug Rivera, for \ntheir roles in the killing of 23 workers from the Endesa electricity plant in \nSeptember of 1973.  \nThe trial judge (Ministro de fuera) acquitted Klug of aggravated kidnapping \nand aggravated murder by invoking th e ICL doctrine of command responsibility \nand superior orders, and specifically by invoking the Rome Statute\u2019s recognition \nof obedience of superior orders as a defense.164 As the court noted, the Rome \nStatute recognizes superior orders as a defense, unlike t he Nuremberg tribunal or \nthe ad hoc tribunals, which viewed it only as a potential mitigating factor.165  \nTurning instead to domestic law on superior orders, the Court of Appeals \noverturned the decision on appeal.166  It found that, though the elements of the \ndefense of superior orders at the time of the offense under Chilean law were \nunclear, Klug had failed to meet Chilean military law\u2019s requirement for the \ndefense of superior orders under any definition by failing to present evidence that \nthere was an order from a superior.167  \nThe trial court\u2019s invocation of ICL, and in particular the Rome Statute, is \nstriking because it was one of the only instances of a Chilean court explicitly \nturning to ICL to decide the contour s of the domestic law charge. Whereas with \nthe instances of reframing discussed thus far, courts turned to ICL for the \nelements of crimes against humanity, the establishment of which precluded \napplication of statutes of limitations or the amnesty, here the  court was looking \nto define a defense to the underlying Chilean charge by borrowing one from the \nRome Statute. In some ways, this move is less bold than the crimes against \nhumanity reframing seen above because there is no prohibition on retroactive \napplic ation of law more favorable to an accused under the legality principle and, \n \n163 Ministro de Fuero [M.D.F.] [trial court], 15 noviembre 2010, \u201cEpisodio Endesa,\u201d Rol \nde la causa: 2182 -1998, Sentencia.  \n164 Id. \u00b6 17 (\u201cEl Estatuto, en el art\u00edculo 3 3.1 a), b), y c), y 2, concordado con el art\u00edculo 28, \nletra b) en lo que respecta a las \u00f3rdenes entre superiores subordinados, dispone que ellas pueden \nconstituir una eximente cuando la persona que ha cometido el crimen estuviera obligado por ley \na obedece r \u00f3rdenes emitidas por el Gobierno o el superior de que se trate, no supiera que la orden \nera il\u00edcita y, en el caso de los cr\u00edmenes de guerra, que la orden no fuera manifiestamente il\u00edcita \n(Estatuto de la Corte Penal Internacional).\u201d)  \n165 Id. \u00b6 18.  \n166 Corte d e Apelaciones [C.

It is a striking example of a Chilean court using \ninternational law  to define a defense to Chilean charges. Nevertheless, this \napplication of ICL did not stand for long, as it was reversed on appeal.  \n5. Sentencing Reductions  \nSupreme Court judges  also have invoked the Rome Statute\u2019s provision on \nsentence reductions. In a c ouple of cases, justices  cited Article 110 of the Rome \nStatute for the proposition that a judge \u201c may\u201d but not \u201cmust\u201d consider sentencing \nreductions, and only after a person has done a third of the sentence or, in the case \nof a life sentence, twenty -five years.169 In each case, the justices  invoking this \nRome Statute provision were in the dissent and were in favor of rejecting release \nbased on the gravity of the crimes.170 It appears, although it is not entirely clear \nfrom the decisions, that the y were responding to a defense argument for a \nsentencing reduction based on the Rome Statute.  \n6. Immunity for Minors  \nAt least one defendant has also invoked the Rome Statute for the proposition \nthat ICL prohibits the prosecution of minors for crimes agains t humanity. The \n \n168 See, e.g. , ICCPR, art. 15 (\u201cNo one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on \naccount of any act or omission which did  not constitute a criminal offence, under national or \ninternational law, at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed \nthan the one that was applicable at the time when the criminal offence was committed. If, \nsubsequent to the c ommission of the offence, provision is made by law for the imposition of the \nlighter penalty, the offender shall benefit thereby.\u201d). In the realm of ICL, the Rome Statute \nadopts the principle of lex mitior for ICC cases.

He claimed that t hese \nnorms included a ban on the prosecution of minors, as evidenced by Article 26 \nof the Rome Statute.171 The merits of this argument are debatable, as the Rome \nStatue\u2019s provision is generally considered jurisdictional,172 though some have \nargued that it is  evidence of a customary international law norm against \nprosecuting minors.173 It is unclear what Chilean courts made of the argument as \nthey did not reach the merits.  \nThus, in the Chilean human rights prosecutions, ICL has proved a useful \ntool for defenda nts too.  The main pro -defense argument has been that, per the \nRome Statute, there was no armed conflict at the time of the crime and thus the \nGeneva Conventions and international human rights and IHL norms requiring \nprosecution, do not apply. Courts and l itigants also have used ICL concepts to \nattack the ICL and IHL -based pro -accountability arguments by arguing that the \nrequirements for crimes against humanity were not met, sometimes setting those \nrequirements high. ICL has also found its way into argument s in favor of \nrecognizing the defense of superior orders, sentencing reductions, and immunity \nfor crimes committed by minors.  \nG. Invocations of ICL in Contemporary Cases  \nNot all invocations of ICL or the ICC occur in cases adjudicating \ndictatorship era hum an rights violations.  Unsurprisingly, a few cases in the \nConstitutional Court relate to the constitutionality of the Rome Statute itself or \nthe Chilean legislation implementing the Rome Statute. (The Court held that both \nare constitutional.) However, ICL a rguments have appeared in a variety of \ncriminal cases outside of the context of the human rights abuses of the Pinochet \nregime.  \nFirst, ICL has come up repeatedly in the context of extradition of human \nrights violators from neighboring countries. Most nota bly perhaps, in litigation \nover the extradition of former Peruvian dictator, Alberto Fujimori. In the decision \nthat approved Fujimori\u2019s extradition, the Supreme Court noted the gravity of the \n \n171 Rome Statute, supra  note 2, art. 26 (\u201cThe court shall have no jurisdiction over any \nperson who was under the age of 18 at the alleged commission of a crime.\u201d).  \n172 See MARK A.

A defendant in a contemporary drug trafficking case \nargued that ICL made Chilean forms of criminal participation obsolete.181  In a \nhuman trafficking case, in response to a defendant\u2019s  argument that the Chilean \nlaw on trafficking was unconstitutional based on vagueness grounds, a court \ncited the Rome Statute\u2019s provision on slavery for the proposition that slavery is \nadequately defined, can constitute a crime against humanity, and is a jus cogens  \nnorm under international law.182 \nIn a contemporary criminal bankruptcy fraud case, the defendant argued the \nunconstitutionality of the law under which he was prosecuted. He invoked the \nRome Statute, and the ICC case, Prosecutor v. Lubanga , for the  proposition that, \nalthough the ICL had enshrined the principle of non -retroactivity, it established \nthat defendants should benefit from subsequent changes in the law, if favorable, \nand the rule of lenity.183  This case is notable in that it is a rare insta nce, where a \ncourt mentions a judicial decision from an international tribunal,184 rather than \nthe statute of the court.  \nFinally, in a contemporary case stripping a senator of immunity based on \nfraud allegations, the lawyer seeking the revocation of immuni ty invoked the \nRome Statute for the proposition that immunities do not shield public officials \nfrom liability.185 This invocation of ICL reveals a misunderstanding of ICL, since \n \nratificado, estima la se\u00f1ora F iscal Judicial que ellos van a resultar aplicables en el presente caso \nespecialmente en cuanto digan relaci\u00f3n con los principios de Derecho Internacional \nconsiderados como \u2018jus cogens\u2019\u201d).  \n180 Id.

The \ncourt ultimately stripped the senator of immunity, but based on domestic legal \ngrounds. 186 \nThus, ICL ar guments and, in particular, references to the ICC, appear not \nonly in the context of the Chilean prosecutions for dictatorship -era human rights \nabuses, but also in contemporary cases, some human rights -related and others \nnot. These invocations of ICL in ne w contexts seem to suggest that once judicial \nactors gain familiarity with ICL and view it as a viable source of arguments, it \nwill be marshalled in new and varied contexts.  \nIV. LESSONS FROM THE CHILEAN HUMAN RIGHTS PROSECUTIONS FOR \nINTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE  \nThe Chilean human rights trials offer an example of a domestic judiciary \nacquainting itself and coopting ICL norms to assist in domestic prosecutions for \natrocity crimes. The varying ways in which judges have turned to ICL are \ninstructive. They ind icate that, at least where crimes precede the Rome Statute, \njudges appear more comfortable using ICL and Rome Statute -based arguments \nfor contextual and rhetorical purposes, rather than to interpret or define domestic \ncrimes. The Chilean experience reveals  transformation of ICL as it hits the \ndomestic arena, sometimes with adjustment later on to realign with international \ndoctrine. It also indicates the importance of the accessibility of ICL sources, in \nparticular international judgments, in facilitating th e dissemination or ICL norms \nfrom international tribunals. Finally and relatedly, it demonstrates the critical role \nbeing played by the Inter -American Court as the gateway for ICL norms, as well \nas the utility of the ICC regime in providing a more solid fo undation for the \ninvocation of ICL norms.  \nA. Overall Increased, but Not Linear, Incorporation of ICL  \nFor one, the Chilean experience demonstrates the messiness of domestic \naccountability processes and implementation of ICL norms. Although courts \nturned increasingly to ICL arguments, and in particular used the crimes against \nhumanity reframing device to an  ever-wider variety of ends over time, it was not \na straight path towards more accountability or greater acceptance of ICL \n \nnorma que fue ya promulgada y es Ley de la Rep\u00fa blica . . .  Lo cual significa que al alero de los \ntratados internacionales suscritos por Chile que se incorporan en la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica por \nmedio de su art\u00edculo quinto el fuero constitucional no es ni siquiera hoy en d\u00eda en el siglo \nveintiuno una cue sti\u00f3n de car\u00e1cter absoluto es ese el prisma que debe en definitiva debe \notorga\u0301rsele a este ante juicio.\u201d).  \n186 Id. 52 University of California, Davis  [Vol. 26:1  \nnorms.187   \nCourts flip -flopped repeatedly on most issues, including the existence of a \nnon-international armed conflict, whether IHRL  and ICL precluded application \nof a civil statute of limitations and the permissibility under international norms, \nincluding ICL norms, of the doctrine of media prescripci\u00f3n. Lawyers \ninterviewed emphasized that, for example, whether a court would apply med ia \nprescripci\u00f3n depended in large part on the composition of the chamber of the \nSupreme Court.188 Likewise, whether the international law prohibition on \nstatutes of limitations for crimes against humanity applied to civil cases appeared \nin large part to dep end on whether the case had been sent to the Criminal \nChamber (yes) or to the Constitutional Chamber (no) of the Supreme Court. \nCourts also justified the legality (in the sense of non -retroactivity) of reliance on \nICL and international human rights norms i n a wide variety of manners.  \nICL incorporation does not occur in a vacuum. As many commentators have \nnoted, many advances in human rights cases have depended on a changing \njudiciary more willing to press for accountability and more open to international \nnorms.189 This observation appears to hold true in the Chilean judgements \ninvoking ICL and the ICC. In many instances, it is the very same justices making \nthe very same arguments over and over, and all that shifts is the composition of \nthe court and a majorit y argument becoming a minority one or a minority a \nmajority.190  \nMoreover, a review of the Chilean judicial decisions discussing ICL \nindicates that, although ICL is playing a role in the human rights cases, it is not \ndoing the work alone. For one, judges ha d been making arguments, sometimes \nsuccessful, for avoiding barriers based on domestic law for some time.191  Even \n \n187 Cf. Collins, Incremental Truth , supra  note 93, at 135 (observing that the phases of \njudicial interpretation of the amnesty \u201cwere not a tidy, inexorable ratcheting up towards further \naccountability, nor do they represent consistent planning or strategy on the part of one \nidentifiable key ac tor or set of actors. Only the fourth phase, moreover, rests explicitly on \nprinciples of international, rather than solely domestic, law. Each phase contained internal \nsetbacks, and none is irreversible.\u201d).  \n188 Ugas, supra  note 106.  \n189 See Naomi Glassman, International Human Rights Treaties and the Chilean  \nDictatorship: Legal Applications and Judicial Receptions After the Fall of the Pinochet Military \nRegime , 23 U.C.  DAVIS J. INT\u2019L L. & POL\u2019Y 193, 208 -09 (2017).  \n190 See discussion supra notes 42 & 101.  For example, the Supreme Court\u2019s arguments \nregarding the absenc e of a non -international armed conflict that would trigger the application of \nthe Geneva Conventions effectively was a copy and paste from decision to decision (majority \nand later dissent) by Justices Ballesteros and Segura.  \n191 Cf. Alexandra Huneeus, Rejec ting the Inter -American Court: Judicialization, National \nCourts, and Regional Human Rights , in CULTURES OF LEGALITY : JUDICIALIZATION AND \nPOLITICAL ACTIVISM IN LATIN AMERICA , 123 (Javier Couso, et al. eds. 2010) (\u201cIt is important \nto note, however, that this  is the direction that the Chilean courts have been heading since 1998. \nRare was the judge who applied the Amnesty Decree in cases of disappearance and extrajudicial \nkilling. Some had even allowed torture cases to move forward, an action that could only be  \njustified under international law. The few cases to which the Amnesty Decree was applied were 2019]  ICL by Analogy  53 \nwhen judges do invoke ICL, they do not invoke ICL exclusively, but rather ICL, \nIHRL, IHL, and domestic law.  Thus, the Chilean human rights cases indicate \nthat ICL is but one source from which judges draw to help justify arguments \nunder international law.  \nB. Invocation, Conflation, and Mutation of ICL  \nThe Chilean human rights cases also demonstrate the process of mutation \nof ICL norms i n domestic cases. As discussed above, in a number of decisions \ncourts seemed to insert extra requirements into the definition of crimes against \nhumanity, relating to such things as gravity, cruelty or discriminatory intent, not \npresent in the ICC\u2019s definit ion of crimes against humanity. Likewise, there are \nrepeated instances of judges conflating distinct international crimes and the fields \nof ICL, IHRL, and IHL.192 The Chilean example of migration and mutation of \nICL norms echoes that of other domestic judic iaries wrestling with often \nunfamiliar, at least initially, questions of international law.193  \nPluralism (glass half full) or fragmentation (half empty) in ICL rightly has \nreceived a great deal of attention. 194 The different fora in which ICL is used \u2014\ndifferent international criminal tribunals (some ad hoc, one permanent), hybrid \ndomestic -international criminal tribunals, domestic courts \u2014combined with the \ndifferent legal traditions of actors within any given international court, makes the \nemergence of diverg ent norms almost inevitable.195 The multiplication of norms \npresents a challenge to the purported universality of ICL norms,196 but there is \n \nusually reversed at the Supreme Court level. The reliance on international law was a milestone, \nbut one in a string of many. Thus, it is impossible to attribute this switch to the Inter -American \nCourt\u2019s single decision, or even its line of decisions. Rather, the Inter -American Court provided \none more tool in the kit of those arguing against the Amnesty Decree, and it made it that much \nmore inconceivable for the Su preme Court to apply the Amnesty Decree in the cases that it had \nnot already closed.\u201d).  \n192 See discussion supra note 106 and accompanying text.  \n193 See generally  Mark A.

The Chilean human rights cases, however, \nare somewhat distinct in that, d ue to the high numbers of the cases, there is now a strong cadre \nof judges and lawyers who are repeat players, who have thus had the opportunity to turn \nrepeatedly to ICL and other international law norms.  \n194 See STAHN & VAN DEN HERIK , supra  note 11. \n195 Id. at 87.  \n196 See Drumbl, supra note 193, at 444 (\u201cOn the one hand, these migrations [of  \ninternational law] facilitate wider awareness, recognition,  and internalization of international \ncriminal law.

These different fora can serve as laboratories of experimentation.197 \nAs Carsten Stahn and Larissa van den Herik have noted: \u201cInconsistencies and \nlegitimate differences are part of this logic.\u201d198 Indeed, the International Law \nCommission (ILC) Report on Fragmentation cautions that conscious departures \nfrom an international law norm should not be viewed as \u201ctechn ical errors.\u201d199  \nThe report notes: \u201cNormative conflicts do not arise as technical \u201cmistakes\u201d that \ncould be \u201cavoided\u201d by a more sophisticated way of legal reasoning. New rules \nand legal regimes emerge as responses to new preferences, and sometimes out \nof co nscious effort to deviate from preferences as they existed under old \nregimes.\u201d200 \nSome of the Chilean departures from ICL norms may fall within this zone \nof expression of new preferences, or at least the expression of preferences in a \nnew judicial context. For example, although, in contrast to the interpretation of \nthe crime seen in several Chilean judgments,201  the Rome Statute\u2019s definition of \ncrimes against humanity does not include a gravity requirement, the ICC itself \ndoes recognize gravity as an admissi bility criterion for the court and a \ndiscretionary consideration for the prosecutor.202 Thus, the Chilean \u2018crimes \nagainst humanity plus\u2019 argument can be viewed as an error in transplanting the \ncrimes against humanity norm or as an adaptation of these ICC \nadmissibility/discretion -guiding doctrines to the Chilean context. It is less \nobvious, however, that a gravity threshold makes sense in a domestic \njurisdiction.  \nThe Chilean caselaw on crimes against humanity also demonstrates course \ncorrection or, perhaps, c hanges of preference. For example, in recent curfew \ncases, courts have backed away from these \u2018crimes against humanity plus\u2019 \n \nInternational jurisprudence \u2013 no different than any sources of law or precedent \u2013 may be \nmisapplied, or wishfully applied, in national contexts.

Role of the Regional Human Rights Institutions in Bringing ICL to \nDomestic Jurisdictions  \nThe Chilean human rights cases also reveal the critical role played by the \nInter-American Court as a gateway for ICL.

Alexandra Huneeus has made a \ncompelling argument th at the Inter -American Court of Human Rights is playing \na quasi -criminal role by demanding that states investigate and prosecute human \nrights abuses.205 The Chilean human rights cases offer an example of this \ndynamic, but they illustrate more. They reveal th at the Inter -American Court has \nalso provided a template for domestic courts to incorporate ICL arguments in the \nface of legality constraints and has distilled and translated relevant ICL norms.  \nJudges and lawyers interviewed emphasized the importance of t he Inter -\nAmerican Court and Almonacid .

The Inter -American court decisions involving Chilean human rights cases, \nin particular Almonacid  and Lucero , acknowledged that judges could not apply \nthe Inter -American Convention or modern ICL directly to the facts, since these \nlaws post -dated the abuses, but instead injected them into the case as part of an \nargument about the \u201ccontext\u201d in which abuses oc curred and Chile\u2019s obligations \nwith respect to investigation, punishment, and reparations today. As Karinna \nFern\u00e1ndez notes, the first case in which the Chilean Supreme Court refused to \nenforce the amnesty or statute of limitations on the basis of internat ional law \n(rather than a purely domestic law theory that kidnapping is a continuing crime) \nquoted extensively from a decision of the Inter -American Court of Human \nRights.210  \nAs discussed above with respect to retroactivity, statute of limitations and \namnes ty, proportionality of punishment, and reparations, Chilean judges have \nemployed a similar logic to invoke modern ICL norms.  Rather than convicting \ndirectly for Rome Statute crimes, judges cite ICL and the Rome Statute as \nevidence of Chile\u2019s obligations t oday. As Eduardo Contreras noted, \u201ctoday, \njudgements are full of citations to international conventions and treaties, \nincluding treaties not ratified by Chile.\u201d211  \nAs the next Part illustrates, the Inter -American Court is also a place to \ntranslate and dist ill relevant ICL principles for domestic judges and lawyers who \nmay lack the time and often the language skills to follow developments at the \nICC or other international tribunals systematically.  \n \npenales\u201d). Likewise, Alexandra Huneeus has argued that the Inter -American Court, though a \nhuman rights court has come to take on quasi -criminal functions, by ordering stat es to investigate \nand prosecute human rights  abuses and then supervising their compliance with those orders.  \nSee generally  International Criminal Law by Other Means , supra note 12. \n209 Contreras, supra  note 66 (\u201cno hab\u00edamos prestado atenci\u00f3n a la Corte Inter -Americana. \n[hasta ten\u00edan] una visi\u00f3n mala de la corte. \u2026 Cuando sali\u00f3 el caso Almonacid  nos dimos cuenta \nde la importancia del la Corte Inter -Americana.

Accessibility of ICL  \nA related theme that emerges from int erviews and judgments is the \nimportance of the accessibility of ICL.  The ICL arguments discussed in Parts III \nabove are either general references to general principles of ICL or jus cogens  \nnorms or to the Rome Statute itself or a citation to one text on crimes against \nhumanity in Spanish written by Kai Ambos.212 There are very few references to \ncaselaw of the international tribunals, and where they appear they are largely \nverbatim repetition  of cites to the same few cases.213  Some of this tendency to \ncite conventions or the statutes of tribunals (and Kai Ambos) likely stems from \nChile\u2019s civil law tradition which prioritizes statutes and \u201cdoctrina\u201d (academic \nwritings) over caselaw. However, it  is not uncommon to see lower court \ndecisions citing cases of the Chilean Supreme Court for support, so the use of \ncaselaw at least as persuasive authority appears to be acceptable.214 \n \n212 The Westlaw results for \u201cInternational Criminal Court\u201d include sixteen almost identical \nreferences to one text (in Spanish) by Kai Ambos for  the proposition that crimes against \nhumanity must be committed pursuant to a state or other organizational policy. See, e.g ., Corte \nSuprema de Justicia [C.S.J.] [Supreme Court], 26 de enero 2016, Programa Continuaci\u00f3n Ley \nN 19.123 y otro con Carlos Abatte  Gago, Rol: 8704 -2015 (\u201cEste elemento de la pol\u00edtica deja \nclaro que es necesario alg\u00fan tipo de v\u00ednculo con un Estado o un poder de facto y, por lo tanto, \nla organizaci\u00f3n y planificaci\u00f3n por medio de una pol\u00edtica, para categorizar de otro modo los \ndelitos c omunes como crimen de lesa humanidad (Ambos, Kai. \"Cr\u00edmenes de Lesa Humanidad \ny la Corte Penal Internacional\u201d)\u201d).  \n213 Several cases cite the ICTY\u2019s Tadic Interlocutory Decision on Jurisdiction, see  \nProsecutor v.

Apel.] 58 University of California, Davis  [Vol. 26:1  \nThe preference for citing conventions and a single academic text over \ncaselaw may also stem, at least in part, from the difficulty judges have in \naccessing ICL caselaw. Although the Rome Statute is translated into Spanish, \ndecisions from international criminal courts are not.215 A significant number of \nthe lawyers and judges in terviewed did not read or speak any other languages \nfluently.216  Minister 1, said on the one hand that \u201cICL is not so far away,\u201d but \non the other that, \u201cwe don\u2019t have the cases from Yugoslavia.\u201d217 Given the \nrelative paucity of ICC judgments to date, the ca selaw of the ICTY and the ICTR \nrepresents the vast majority of modern ICL jurisprudence.  \nOne human rights judge noted that the same barrier existed with precedent \nfrom other countries. In one of the judge\u2019s past cases, there was a French case \nthat had add ressed a similar issue, but, the judge, noted that \u201cif something doesn't \narrive translated it's difficult to rely on it.\u201d218  The judge explained, however, that \nthe situation was better at the Supreme Court level because they had foreign legal \nexperts advis ing on cases.219  \nThe central role of the Inter -American Court as the vehicle for importing \nICL likely relates at least in part to language. The decisions of the Inter -American \nCourt are available in Spanish and thus ICL arguments that appear in Inter -\nAmeri can Court decisions are readily available to Spanish -readers. Decisions \nand judgments of international criminal criminals, by contrast, typically are \nnot.220 Although most judges indicated that, if they really wanted something they \ncould get it, language ba rriers notwithstanding,221 it is naturally harder review \nthe terrain of international criminal caselaw when decisions are only available in \n \n[Court of Appeals], 25 mayo 2017, \u201cAgrupaci\u00f3n de Familiares de Ejecutados Pol\u00edticos c.

One human rights judge for example \nwould look up cases from other internati onal tribunals when they were cited in \nan Inter -American Court decision .222 \nLanguage matters for the lawyers too. Human rights lawyer, Cristi\u00e1n Cruz, \nsaid, for example, that he has cited the ICC and the ICTY, but he does not follow \nthem. When asked whether language was a barrier, he joked \u201ca little qualm.\u201d223  \nBy contrast, a younger human rights lawyer, Francisco Jara Bustos, who speaks \nEnglish and can read French, said that he tries to keep up on ICL through \nsubscriptions to the Grotius Center out of Leiden and the Ibero -American \nInstitute in the Hague, but note d that \u201cit is not a daily thing.\u201d224 \nLanguage is not the only barrier, of course. Judges also face heavy \ncaseloads. Many have many dozens if not hundreds of cases before them, often \ninvolving multiple v ictims and multiple perpetrators.225 A few lawyers \ninterviewed indicated that they simply did not have time to keep tabs on the latest \nICL caselaw coming from international courts.226 Again, this lack of time may \nbe tied to legality constraints on the potential uses of ICL in the dictatorship -era \ncases.  If courts relied more heavily on ICL to define the crimes at issue or the \nparameters of criminal liability, judges and lawyers might make time to track \nICL developments more closely.   \nNevertheless, the experience of Chilean advocates and judges with ICL \nsuggests the importance of language. It indicates that a potentially useful tool for \nICL norm dissemination is in translation of judgm ents. ICL caselaw should be \ntranslated into as many languages as possible, with an eye to selecting languages \nand judgments that could have the greatest impact in domestic jurisdictions. The \nChilean example also shows the potentially critical role to be pl ayed by \nacademics in fleshing out doctrine from caselaw in different languages, \nparticularly in civil law jurisdictions.  \nFinally, the Chilean courts\u2019 heavy reliance on conventions also suggests the \npotential utility of international instruments, such as the International Law \nCommission\u2019s (ILC) Draft Articles on Crimes Against Humanity.227  The ILC\u2019s \nDraft Articles, unlike the Rome Statute, have been drafted with a primary \nobjective of providing guidance to national courts.228 Although p erhaps of \n \n222 Minister 1, supra  note 57 (\u201cNo es algo sistema\u0301tico\u201d).  \n223 Cruz, supra  note 64 (\u201c[U]n peque\u00f1o reparo\u201d).  \n224 Jara Bustos, supra  note 125 (\u201c[N]o es una cosa diaria\u201d). Jara Bustos noted that he was \nwriting an article on the ICC\u2019s Lubanga  case, because he is interested in principles of reparation. \nSee id.  \n225 Minister 5, supra note 57 (for example, has some eighty active human rights cases, \nsome with more than a hundred complainants.).  \n226 Cruz, supra  note 64 (\u201cno puedo pasar todo el d\u00eda leyendo\u201d).  \n227 Thanks to Sean Murphy for this observation. See generally  \nhttp://legal.un.org/ilc/guide/7_7.shtml.  \n228 See, e.g., Int\u2019l Law Comm\u2019n, Second Rep. on Crimes Against Humanity, U.N.

The Legitimating Function of the Rome Regime  \nThe use of ICL in the Chilean human rights prosecutions also demonstrates \nthe utility of the ICC regime in providing judges a more solid footing to  use ICL \narguments.  Although Chilean judges have been willing to use ICL to \ncircumnavigate domestic obstacles to prosecution or as rhetorical support for the \ngravity of the crimes, judges have been very reluctant to use ICL to interpret \ncrimes, defenses or  forms of participation for acts that preceded the Rome \nStatute, likely, at least in part, for legality reasons. In the rare instances in which \njudges either explicitly or implicitly used ICL to interpret crimes, in particular \nwith respect to joint crimina lity and command responsibility, they were \noverturned on appeal.231   \nHowever, with each step towards adoption and incorporation of the Rome \nStatute, Chilean courts grew bolder in citing it.  After Chile signed the Rome \nStatute, judges would make Rome Statu te-based arguments noting that Chile had \nan obligation not to undermine the treaty\u2019s purpose. Upon the passage of \ndomestic implementing legislation, judges began citing the Rome Statute, along \nwith the domestic legislation, with greater frequency in suppor t of ICL \narguments. 232 Although it is likely unwise to read too much into the limited \nsample that is the subject of study here, it seems possible that the signing of the \nRome Statute and domestic legislation translating international crimes into \ndomestic l aw increased judicial confidence in invoking ICL doctrine to ascertain \nthe contours of criminal responsibility, even when the Rome Statute technically \n \nunder national law for persons who have committed crimes against humanity\u201d); Int\u2019l Law \nComm\u2019n, Fourth Rep. on Crimes Against Humanity, U.N.

See Int\u2019l Law \nComm\u2019n Fourth Rep., supra  note 228, \u00b6 5-7. \n230 Many materials are already available in six languages. The Fourth Report, for example, \nis available in Chinese, Arabic, English, French, Russian, and  Spanish. See id.  \n231 See supra  Part III .F. \n232 See Figure 2, supra  Part III .C. 2019]  ICL by Analogy  61 \ndoes not govern the acts, because the crimes precede its adoption.  \nBut the Chilean experience with ICL ar guably also cuts the opposite way \nand suggests the potential relevance of the Rome Statute even for non -States \nParty to the treaty. Although the Chilean caselaw may evince a greater judicial \nwillingness to invoke ICL and the Rome Statute after Chile formal ized its \nparticipation in the Rome regime through signing of the treaty and the passage \nof domestic implementing legislation, it also shows that the Rome Statute still \nhas rhetorical force outside of contexts to which it technically applies. Long \nbefore an y domestic implementing legislation, litigants and courts were citing \nICL for the proposition that international law precluded application of the \namnesty or statute of limitation for crimes against humanity or war crimes, as \ndefined by the Rome Statute.233 Thus, following the logical template of the Inter -\nAmerican Court, Chilean courts used ICL to interpret Chile\u2019s obligations today, \neven if they believed themselves without authority to convict directly based on \nICL. Courts adjudicating pre - Rome Statute cri mes elsewhere could do much the \nsame, as could courts of non -state parties.  \nF. ICL Spillover Effects  \nThe use of ICL in Chilean human rights cases suggests  that once ICL is on \nthe table as a source of arguments and judges and lawyers become familiar with \nit, it will be used to support different ends and in different contexts.  The cases \ndiscussed above illustrate an expansion in the use of ICL from merely an \nargument to avoid application of statutes of limitations and the amnesty, to an \nargument to support p roportional punishment (i.e. no media prescripci\u00f3n), \nreparations (i.e. no statute of limitations for civil cases, not just criminal), and \nspecial protection for minors, among other arguments. It also has been used by \nthe defense. Despite its initial pro -accountability uses, ICL has been marshalled \nby judges to block prosecutions and by defense attorneys to argue for reduced \nsentences and recognition of the doctrine of obedience to superior orders.  \nThe invocations of ICL and the ICC in contemporary criminal  cases also \nreveal that these ICL arguments may not be restricted to their most obvious \napplications. Although they are typically invoked in the dictatorship -era human \nrights prosecutions, litigants and judges in contemporary cases are likewise \ninvoking IC L and the law of the ICC to support arguments related to extradition, \nthe rule of lenity, retroactivity norms, and the definition of human trafficking.234   \nInterviewees also viewed the human rights cases as having affected the \njudiciary\u2019s openness to international law in other areas.  Minister 2 explained that \nthe \u201chuman rights cases opened the path for the protection of other human \nrights,\u201d including discrim ination and gender, and for greater reliance on \ninternational law arguments and even a greater tendency to turn to the \n \n233 See supra Part III.D.1 and III.D.2.  \n234 See supra Part III .G. 62 University of California, Davis  [Vol. 26:1  \nfundamental rights provisions of the constitution in other contexts.235 Human \nrights lawyer Eduardo Contreras says that, more broadly spea king, the human \nrights cases have generally raised the bar in the legal system: \u201cthe role of the \ntrials has elevated the character of the judiciary \u2014an ethical effect.\u201d236  Thus, the \ncourts\u2019 use of international law, including ICL, in the dictatorship -era ca ses may \ncontribute to a greater openness to international law and rights -based arguments \nthroughout the judiciary and in a variety of different areas of the law.  \nStill, the effects of the Chilean human rights cases on human rights in Chile \nis complicated. The promotion of ICL and human rights in criminal cases in a \ndeeply divided society has a complex impact on promotion of these bodies of \nlaw in Chile going forward. On the one hand, Pandora\u2019s box has been opened \nand there is far greater familiarity and acc eptance among judicial actors with \ninternational norms. On the other, the use of ICL and human rights law in the \ndictatorship -era cases garners resistance even for new legislation from members \nof society who fear retroactive application of norms, who are t ired of hearing \nabout the human rights violations of the dictatorship, and who associate the issue \nwith the left. As one Supreme Court Justice put it, \u201cthe issue of human rights has \nbeen tied to the crimes of the dictatorship . . . there are many forms of human \nrights violations today . . . it has complicated matters for us to isolate the issue of \nhuman rights.\u201d237    \nV.

ICL, in conjunction wit h IHL and IHRL, has played an important role \nin overcoming domestic barriers to accountability, expressing condemnation for \ngross human rights abuses, and in pushing judges to think more expansively \nabout the types of harm that warrant judicial attention. ICL and the ICC have \nbeen invoked for a variety of propositions by complainants, defendants, and \njudges alike, sometimes in favor of accountability and sometimes against it.  ICL \ndoctrine has undergone some changes (intentional or not) in the domestic \ncontext, sometimes with subsequent realignment with ICL doctrine. ICL and the \nRome Statute likewise have been coopted by contemporary litigants in contexts \nquite removed from atrocity crimes.  The Chilean experience suggests  as well \nthat a number of ingredients  factor into the incorporation of ICL and \ndemonstrates the critical importance of an interrelated web of international law \nprotections and institutions, in particular the critical role played by regional \nhuman rights institutions; the importance of accessi bility and translation of ICL \nfor domestic actors; and the utility of participation in the ICC regime for the \nincorporation of ICL norms domestically.  \n \n ", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
