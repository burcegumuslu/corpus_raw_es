Urban, as well as available information on products marketed in the European Community,  \nincluding pharmaceutical forms, indications, posology and methods of administration , with th e aim to \nprepare the Community monograph on the plant and its preparations. This report is based on the \ndocumentation provided by the European Medic ines Agency  (EMA) completed by further searches and \ninformation taken from international literature. Bibliog raphic searches have been performed in PubMed \nand MEDLINE until 2008; EMBASE (1974- 2008). The search terms were: Centella asiatica, asiaticoside, \nGotu Kola, Indian Pennywort, Hydrocotyle asiatica  \n1.1.  Description of the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s ) or \ncombinations thereof  \n\u2022 Herbal substance(s) \nCentella asiatica (L.) Urban is a stoloniferous perennial herb  belonging to the plant family Apiaceae  \n(Umbelliferae) (see Table 1), which contains 20 different species. It is a slender, creeping plant, \nrooting at the nodes, growing in the damp areas in different tropical countries.  \nApart from this name, which is usually employed in scientific work, the synonym Hydrocotyle asiatica  L. is the designation most commonly found. In German, the medicinal plant is als o known by \nthe colloquial name of \"Indischer Wassernabel\". Further names are: Indian Pennywort (English), Hydrocotyle Asiatique (French), Idrocotile (ltalian), Brahma- manduki and Brahmi -Buti (Hindi), Tsubo-\nkusa (Japanese), and Tungchian and Luei Gong Gen (Chinese), Blasteostimulina (asiaticoside) \n(Spanish). In India it is commonly known as \u2018Indian Pennywort\u2019 \u201cJal Brahmi\u201d or \u2018Mandookaparni\u2019 or \nGotu Kola (Brinkhaus et al.  2000) . \n \nTable 1.   \nSystematic classification (Taxonomy)  \nClassification  Name  \nKingdom  Eukaryota  \nSubkingdom  Embryophyta  \nDivision  Spermatophyta  \nSubdivision  Angiospermae  \nClass Dicotyledoneae  \nSubclass  Rosidae  \nSuperorder  Aralianae  \nOrder  Araliales (Umbellif lorae)  \nFamily  Apiaceae or Umbelliferae  \nSubfamily  Hydrocotyle  \nGenus  Centella  \nSpecies  Centella asiatica  \nSynonyms:  \nHydrocotyle asiatica L., herba  \nHydrocotyle lunata Lam., herba   \nTrisanthus cochinchinensis Lour,  herba  \nCentella coriacea Nannfd.,  herba  \nCentella cordifolia, (Hooker fil) Nannfd.,  herba   \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.)

In summary the constituents of Centella asiatica  are the following \n(modified from Brinkhaus et al. 2000):  \nTable 2.

Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 6/44 \n The substances of therapeutic interest are the saponin -containing triterpene acids and their sugar \nesters, the most important being: asiatic acid, madecassic acid and the three asiaticosides, \nasiaticoside, asiaticoside A and asiaticoside B (Fig. 1 -  Brinkhaus et al. 2000). The structures of the \nthree triterpenoid trisaccharides asiaticoside, asiaticoside -A and asiaticoside -B, have been elucidated \nby spectroscopic analysis as the [O -\u03b2-L-rhamnopyranosyl -(l\u21924)-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl(l \u21926)]- O-\u03b2-D-\nglucopyranose esters of 2 \u03b2,3\u03b2,23\u03b2-trihydroxy -urs-12-ene-28-oic acid, of 2 \u03b2,3\u03b2,6\u03b2,23v-tetrahydroxy -\nurs-12-ene-28-oic acid and of 2 \u03b2,3\u03b2,6\u03b2,23\u03b2-tetrahydroxyolean - 12-ene-28-oic acid (Sahu et al. 1989).  \nThe main active principles of Centella asiatica, are the triterpenoids glycosides asiaticoside and \nmadecassoside (asiaticoside A), used for the quantification of this species  as described in the European \nPharmacopoeia, and their respective agly cons (asiatic acid and madecassic acid). Significant \ndifferences in active constituent contents have been observed between samples of Centella asiatica \noriginating from different countries (Randriamampionona et al. 2007) . Depending on the source of the \nmaterial, the amount of the triterpenoids may vary widely from 1 % to 8% (ESCOP 2009).  \nFig. 1  (from Brinkhaus et al.  2000)  \n \n R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 \nasiatic acid  -H -H -CH3 -CH3 -H \nmadecassic aci d -OH -H -CH3 -CH3 -H \nasiaticoside  -H 1)-\u03b2-D-glc-(6-1)- \u03b2-D-glc-( 4-1)- \u03b1-L-rha -CH3 -CH3 -H \nasiaticoside A1 -OH 1)-\u03b2 -D-glc-(6-1)- \u03b2-D-glc-(4-1)- \u03b1-L-rha -CH3 -CH3 -H \nterminolic acid  -OH -H -CH3 -CH3 -CH3 \nasiaticoside B  -OH 1)-\u03b2 -D-glc-(6-1)- \u03b2-D-glc-(4-1)-\u03b1-L-rha -H -CH3 -CH3 \n \nCentella asiatica plants are reported to contain also the following glycosides: indocentelloside, \nbrahmoside, brahminoside, theankuniside and isothankuniside (Tiwari 2000).  \nThe major component of Centella asiatica essential oil  is an unidentified terpenic acetate [peak 14; M\u2019 \n274 (base 2592 157)]. Other compounds: \u03b2-caryophyllene, trans -p-farnesene and germacrene D have \nbeen detected in Centella asiatica in respectable amount (Asakawa et al.  1982).  \nOther chemical constituents found in Centella asiatica are: vallarine, hydrocotylin, pectic acids, \nsteroids, hersaponin, bacogenin, monnierin, tannins (Sathya & Uthaya Ganga 2007).  \nCentella asiatica leaves are rich in carotenoids, vitamins B and C (Tiwari et al. 2000). Recently, two \nnew flavonoids named castilliferol 1 and castillicetin 2 (both exhibiting antioxidant activity), as well as \n                                                \n1 Madecassoside  \n \n \nAssessment re port on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 7/44 \n a known compound, isochlorogenic acid 3, were isolated from the whole plant of Centella asiatica \n(Subban et al. 2008). The flavonoids apigenin, rutin and quercetin have been detected in methanolic \nextracts of Centella asiatica (Bhandari et al. 2007).  \nA polysaccharide, isolated from ethanolic extracts of Centella asiatica, is a complicated arabinogalactan \n(AG), which contain a little \u03b1 -(1\u21924)-linked Gal pA and \u03b1 -(1\u21922)-linked Rha p residues (Wang et al.  \n2004).  \n \n\u2022 Herbal preparation(s)  \nAlcoholic or aqueous extracts of Centella , as well as refined and purified extracts have been used.  \nLiterature reports studies on the following extracts: TECA, TTFCA and TTF, a ll containing 40% of \nasiaticoside and 60% of the agly cons (asiatic acid and madecassic acid ). In particular clinical studies \nwere published describing the use of the following preparations: TTFCA, TECA and, where the name of \nthe commercial extract is mentioned, Madecassol\u00ae (titrated extract of Centella asiatica ) or \nCentellase\u00ae (total triterpenoid fraction of Centella asiatica ). The extracts TECA and TTFCA in literature  \nare reported to contain 30% of asiatic acid and 30% of madecassic acid, while the extract  TTF is \nreported to comprise 60% of asiatic acid and madecassic acid in a ratio that is not clearly defined. In \nall extracts the remaining 40% is purified asiaticoside (Brinkhaus et al.  2000).  \nInformation coming from literature and licensed medicinal prod ucts confirms that all the above \nmentioned TECA, TTFCA, TTF as well as ETCA and CATTF are different acronyms to designate the same \nextract, commercially known as Madecassol\u00ae or Centellase\u00ae or Blastoestimulina\u00ae, containing 40% of \nasiaticoside and 60% of asi atic acid and madecassic acid.  \nTECA is a highly purified extract, fractioned and enriched in triterpenic acid and triterpenic sugar ester \nfractions to reach about the 40% of asiaticoside and about the 60% of the triterpenic genins: asiatic \nacid and madecassic acid. The purification steps are extreme and involve chemical treatments that remove the herbal matrix . The final extract is a recombination of a highly refined extract with an \nisolated constituent and the natural proportion of the components is not m aintained. Therefore, based \non the information on manufacturing process, the HMPC is of the opinion that TECA extract cannot be \nclassified as an herbal preparation due to the manufacturing steps and composition.\n \nInsufficient information about the quality of other herbal preparation historically in medicinal use is \navailable.  \n \n\u2022 Combinations of herbal substance(s) and/or herbal preparation(s) including a description of \nvitamin(s) and/or mineral(s) as ingredients of traditional combination herbal medicinal prod ucts \nassessed, where applicable.  \nNot applicable   \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.)

The search terms were: Centella asiatica , \nasiaticoside, Gotu Kola, Indian Pennywort, Hydrocotyle asiatica.  \n2.  Historical data on medicinal use  \nCentella asiatica (L.) is an e thnomedical plant used in different continents by diverse ancient cultures \nand tribal groups. The plant is native in  countries like Sri Lanka, Madagascar, South Africa and \nMalaysia.  \nCentella asiatica has been referred to in the ancient traditional Chinese  Shennong Herbal about 2,000 \nyears ago and in Indian Ayurvedic medicine about 3,000 years ago . \nThe Chinese prescribed the leaves in curing leucorrhoea and toxic fever while in India, this plant is \nused in the Ayurvedic system of medicine, usually described under the name of Mandukaparni, to treat \nvarious diseases: asthma, bronchitis, dropsy, elephantiasis, gastric catarrh, kidney troubles, leprosy, \nleucorrhoea, skin diseases and urethritis  (Husain et al. 2007).  \nIn Madagascar, the plant was also used to treat leprosy (Sahu et al.  1989).  \nIn Malaysia, although this herb is commonly eaten fresh as a vegetable (salad), especially among the Malaysia communities, it is also said to have beneficial effects in improving memory and in treating \nmental fatigue, anxiety , and eczema (Goh  et al.1995; Abdul Hamid et al.  2002).  \nFresh extracts of this plant have been used by the people of Java and the Malay Peninsula for many \nyears, as both topical and internal agents, for healing of wounds and constituent of brain tonics for the \ncognitive retard (Kartnig, 1988). These properties have been ascribed to the pentacyclic triterpenes (asiatic acid, asiaticoside, madecassic acid and madecassoside), found to display CVI , varicose vein \nand wound healing properties (Inamdar  et al. 1996). Further experimental studies showed several \nbiological properties of Centella asiatica extracts among which antioxidant activity (Jayashree et al. \n2003, Gnanapragasam et al.  2004) and antiproliferative effect (Yoshida  et al. 2005; \nRandriamampionona et al. 2007).  \nIn folk medicine different uses, not supported by experimental or clinical data, were reported. They \nare: therapy of albinism, anaemia, asthma, bronchitis, cellulite, cholera, measles, constipation, \ndermatitis, diarrhoea, dizziness, dysentery, dysmenorrhoea, dysuria, epistaxis, epilepsy, \nhaematemesis, haemorrhoids, hepatitis, hypertension, jaundice, leucorrhoea, nephritis, nervous \ndisorders, neuralgia, rheumatism, smallpox, syphilis, toothache, urethritis, and varices. It was used as an antipyret ic, analgesic, anti -inflammatory, and \"brain tonic\" agent ( WHO monograph s, 1999). \nPoultices have been used to treat contusions, closed fractures, sprains, and furunculosis (WHO  \nmonographs, 1999).  \nCentella asiatica extracts have been also used in the treat ment of keloids (Hausen et al.  1993) but \nthere are not sufficient clinical data confirming their efficacy in this indication.   \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 11/44 \n 2.1.  Information on period of medicinal use in the Community  \nCentella asiatica has been referred in the French Pharmacopoeia ed. 1884.  Despite its long history of \ntraditional use, Centella  appeared in the Codex in 1884 and the first dry extract was not created until \n1941. Three years after its triterpenoid molecules were isolated by the French scientist, P. Boiteau.  \nThe British Herbal P harmacopoeia reports the systemic use of the aerial part of Centella asiatica in \nrheumatic condition and cutaneous affections and the topical application for indolent wounds, leprous \nulcers and cicatrisation after surgery  (British Herbal Pharmacopoeia 1983 ). \nExternal use  \nTECA has a long history of use in Europe as wound healing drug.  \nMedicinal products containing triterpenic extract from  Centella asiatica are authorised in Europe for \ncutaneous use (powder, cream and ointment) since 1968.  \nActive constituen ts of Centella asiatica are components of many cosmetic preparations worldwide in \nthe area of skin care. The leaves of Centella asiatica found application in clinical practice for \ndermatological disorders and in particular for improving the healing process  of wound, burns, skin and \nvein ulcers (Randriamampionona et al.  2007).  \nInternal use  \nMedicinal products containing Madecassol\u00ae in tablets for oral use are authorised in Europe since 1969 \n(BE). Tablets for oral use are authorised in Belgium, France, Greece , Italy and Portugal. During 1980\u2019s \nseveral clinical studies showed that the Total Triterpenic Fraction of Centella asiatica (TTFCA= TECA) \n(at the oral dose of 60 -120 mg daily, for 30- 90 days) was able to improve subjective and objective \nsymptoms associate d with primary or secondary CVI  of the lower limbs (Husain  et al. 2007) . \nFood supplements are also available in several c ountries with healing claims related to the \nmicrocirculation and the tissue draining. No information about the type of extracts used in  food \nsupplements is available.  \n2.2.

Non-Clinical Data \n3.1.  Overview of available pharmacological data regarding the herbal \nsubstance(s), herbal preparation(s) and  relevant constituents thereof  \nIn literature there are numerous articles describing the pharmacological properties of alcoholic  or \nacqueous extracts of Centella asiatica L. and its constituents.  \nThe pharmacological activity of Centella asiatica extracts has been investigated basically in the \nlaboratory animals and it is thought to be due to saponin constituents, including asiaticoside, asiatic \nacid, and madecassic acid. The pharmacodynamic effects of Centella asiatica have been investigated in \nnumerous anim al experiments and in vitro studies. Demonstrated activities include, wound healing, \nulcer-protective, psychoneuro -pharmacological (cognitive effects), antinociceptive, anti- inflammatory, \nantimicrobial, immunomodulayory, antiproliferative, antimutagenic, a ngiogenetic, antioxidant of the \nCentella  extracts or asiaticoside (Brinkhaus et al.  2000).  \n3.1.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic  studies:  \nWound healing and collagen -poliferative effects  \nAlcoholic  Centella  extracts when topically applied accelerate wound healing stimulating epithelisation \nand increasing the rate of wound contraction.  Reduction in granuloma weight and increase in the force \nneeded to cause rupture of the wound (rupture strength) were also observed. These effects are \nassociated to the increased granulation t issue levels of DNA, protein and total collagen (Suguna et al.  \n1996).  \nAnother study describes the effects of oral and topical administration of an alcoholic extract of the \nleaves of Centella asiatica on rat dermal wound healing. Leaves of Centella asiatic a obtained locally \nwere minced and powdered in absolute ethanol (1ml/g) and the homogenate was filtered through a cotton gauze. The c rude extract (1 ml) was applied topically or given orally once daily for 24 days. The \nextract increased cellular proliferation and collagen synthesis at the wound site, as evidenced by an  \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 15/44 \n increase in DNA, protein and collagen content of granulation tissues. Quicker and better maturation \nand cross linking of collagen was observed in the extract- treated rats. The extract treated  wounds \nwere found to reepithelialise faster and the rate of wound contraction was higher, as compared to control wounds (Suguna et al.  1996) .  \nA single administration (6, 12. 24 mg/kg ) of madecassoside, the major triterpene in Centella asiatica , \nfacilitated wound closure in a time -dependent manner and reached its peak effect, nearly completely \nwound closure, on day 20 in the group receiving the highest dose of 24 mg/kg of madecassoside. \nHistopathological analysis revealed that madecassoside alleviated infiltration of inflammatory cells as \nwell as enhanced epithelisation resulting from dermal proliferation of fibroblasts. The higher doses (12 and 24 mg/kg) decreased nitric oxide (NO) levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the burn skin \ntissue. However, reduced glutathione (GSH) and hydroxyproline levels were increased in the same skin \ntissue. In addition, madecassoside promoted skin angiogenesis in vivo.  These data suggest that \nmadecassoside has significant wound -healing activity and is one of the major reasons for the use of \nCentella asiatica herb in the successful treatment of burn injury. The effect of madecassoside on \nwound healing may involve several mechanisms including antioxidative activity, collagen synthesis and \nangiogenesis (Liu et al.  2008) . \nCentella  triterpenes evoke a gene- expression response consistent with their prevailing medical uses in \nthe treatment of connective tissue disorders such as wound healing and microangiopathy. TECA was \nused on human fibroblasts. TECA effects the expression of  genes involved in angiogenesis and the \nremodelling of extracellular matrix, as well as diverse growth factor genes. The extent of expression \nchange of TNFAIP6, an extracellular hyaluronan binding protein, was found to be largely dose -\ndependent, to respond most strongly to the free asiatic acid and madecassic acid, and to increase in \nexpression during  48 hours of treatment (Coldren et al.  2003) . \nAngiogenetic activity  \nThe activity of asiaticoside, isolated from Centella asiatica, has been studied in normal a s well as \ndelayed- type wound healing. Different concentrations of solution in sterile saline were prepared for in \nvivo studies. Methylcellulose disks were loaded with 20\u2013 80 \u00b5g asiaticoside for in vitro tests. A gum \nacacia suspension in water was used for oral administration. Centella asiatica promoted angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane model at 40 \u00b5 g/disk concentration. These results suggested that \nasiaticosid e, the main active constituent of Centella asiatica , could have wound healing activity (Shukla \net al. 1999).  \nAntioxidant activity  \nThe antioxidant activity of various extracts (ethanol, water and light petroleum) from different parts of \nCentella asiatica (r oots, leaves, stolons) was evaluated using a linoleic acid model system and the \nthiobarbituric acid test. Ten grams of each freeze -dried part of Centella asiatica were extracted with \nthree different solvents (ethanol, water and light petroleum). The ethanol extract (best activity at pH 7 and stability up to 50\u00b0C) of all parts of Centella asiatica exhibited significantly (P<0.05) higher \nantioxidative activity than the water extract, while the light petroleum ether showed negligible activity. \nIncreasing the c oncentration of  the extract (1000 \u20133000 ppm) resulted in increase in antioxidative \nactivity of both the ethanol and the water extract. From 3000 ppm  upward, antioxidative activity of the \nethanol extract was not significantly different (P<0.05) from that of a -tocopherol. Roots showed the \nhighest activity of the parts tested. The antioxidative activities of the ethanol extracts were found to be \nstable up to 50\u00b0C  and exhibited optimum activity at neutral pH values (Abdul Hamid et al.  2002).  \nThe activities of an ti-oxidant enzymes like SOD, Catalase and Glutathione peroxidase (GSH Px) and the \nlevel of anti- oxidants like Glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic acid were found to be increased significantly  \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 16/44 \n in both the liver and kidney after oral treatment with 50 mg kg-1 day-1 of crude methanolic extract of \nthe Centella asiatica whole plant for 14 days on lymphoma -bearing mice.  The dried finely powdered \nplant (20 g) was extracted with MeOH, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to give a \nsolid residue (2 g)  (Jayashree et al. 2003).   \nAntioxidative activity and total phenolic compounds of root, leaf and petiole of four accessions of Centella asiatica (L.) methanolic extracts, have been investigated by using the ferric thiocyanate (FTC) method and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test. The antioxidative activities were then compared with that of \nthe natural antioxidant a -tocopherol and the synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxytol uene (BHT). \nResults showed that both leaf and root of Centella asiatica had high antioxidative a ctivity, which was as \ngood as that of a -tocopherol. The total phenolic content showed strong association (r\n2=0.90) with \nantioxidative activity suggesting that phenolic compounds are the major contributors to the \nantioxidative activities of Centella asiatic a (Zainol  et al. 2003) . \nIncreased oxidative stress and antioxidant deficit have been suggested to play a major role in \nadriamycin induced cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure due to multiple treatments with \nadriamycin. The cardio protective effect o f Centella asiatica on myocardial marker enzymes and \nantioxidant enzymes in adriamycin induced cardiomyopathy was investigated in rats. The whole plant \nwas shade dried and coarsely ground with grinder. The coarse powder of plant was extracted with  \n8 parts  of distilled water under boiling for 5 hrs and was filtered through a 400 -mesh cloth to collect \nthe extract. The extract was concentrated and freeze dried to get a powder of greenish brown in \ncolour.  The rats administered with adriamycin (2.5 mg/kg body w t, i.p.) caused myocardial damage \nthat was manifested by the elevation of serum marker (LDH, CPK, GOT and GPT) enzymes and showed significant changes in the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx, GST). Treatment with Centella asiatica (200 mg/kg of body wt/or al) extract significantly prevented these alterations and restored the enzyme \nactivities to near normal levels (Gnanapragasam et al.  2004) . \nA study was designed to determine whether extract of Centella asiatica, when administered orally (300 mg/kg body wei ght/day) for 60 days would prevent age- related changes in antioxidant defense \nsystem, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonyl (PCO) content in rat brain regions such as \ncortex, hypothalamus, striatum, cerebellum and hippocampus. Aged rats elicited a significant decline in \nthe antioxidant status and increased the LPO and PCO as compared to control rats in all five regions \nstudied. The increase in LPO and PCO contents were (64%, 34%) in cortex, (86%, 30%) in \ncerebellum, (51%, 47%) in striatum, (77%, 27%) in hypothalamus and (58%, 45%) in hippocampus, \nrespectively, in aged rats as compared to young rats. The whole plant was cleaned, air -dried and \npowdered. The powder was soaked in double distilled water, ethanol in shaking incubator at 25G1 8C \n(1:1) for 2  days. Supplementation of Centella asiatica was effective in reducing brain regional LPO and \nPCO levels and in increasing the antioxidant status. This study shows that Centella asiatica acts as a \npotent antioxidant and consequently could exerted neuroprote ctive effect in protecting rat brain \nagainst age related oxidative damage (Subathra et al.  2005) . \nThe effect of Centella asiatica extract (not specified) and powder in reducing oxidative stress in SpraqueDawley rats was evaluated. Lipid peroxidation was mo nitored by measuring malonaldehyde \n(MDA) level in blood. Activities of free radical- scavenging enzymes (superoxide dismutase and \ncatalase) were determined using H\n2O2 decomposition and nitrobluetetrazolium reduction, respectively. \nResults showed that administration of H 2O2 (0.1%) in drinking water of the rats, for 25 weeks, \nincreased the malonaldehyde levels in erythrocytes of all the rats. However, rats receiving Centella \nasiatica extract, powder and \u03b1-tocopherol had lower MDA levels than did the other rats, which indicates \ndecrease d lipid peroxidation in these rats. Increase in catalase activity of the rats appears to be a \nresponse to H 2O2 accumulation. The decrease in the activity of superoxide dismu tase in Centella \nasiatica-  and \u03b1-tocopherol supplemented rats suggested a lower requirement for the enzyme and this \nindicates the protective effect of the plant in combating oxidative stress undergone by the rats. Results  \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 17/44 \n revealed that Centella asiatica ex tract and powder may ameliorate H 2O2-induced oxidative stress by \ndecreasing lipid peroxidation via alteration of the antioxidant defence system of the rats (Hussin et al.  \n2007) . \n3.1.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamics studies : \nUlcer -protective and anti -ulcer effects  \nAntiulcer activity of plant extract has been compared with effects of famotidine (H2 -antagonist) and \nsodium valproate (anti -epileptic). Fresh whole plants of Centella asiatica were collected locally and \nextracted in a tincture extractor with an ethanol:water  (50:50) mixture.  All the three treatments: \nCentella asiatica, famotidine and sodium valproate have shown a dose dependent reduction of gastric \nulceration. Since Centella asiatica increased dose -dependently brain GABA levels, it has been \nhypothesi sed a mec hanism GABA -dependent. This hypothesis seems to be confirmed by the \nreversibility of antiulcerogenic activity with pretreatment with bicuculline methiodide (specific GABAA -\nantagonist) (Chatterjee et al.  1992).  \nEffects of Centella asiatica on the prevention  of ethanol induced gastric lesions in rats were \ninvestigated.  Thirty grams of Centella asiatica was boiled in 600 ml of distilled water under reflux for \n1 hour. The water extract was filtered and freeze dried to obtain the Centella asiatica extract. The \ngastric transmucosal potential difference (PD) was reduced by the application of 50% ethanol in the  \ngastric ex vivo chamber model . Centella asiatica extract, orally administered (0.05  g/kg, 0.25 g/kg and \n0.50 g/kg) before ethanol administration, significantly inhibited gastric lesions formation (58% to 82% \nreduction) , decreased mucosal myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity , and accelerated its recovery  in a dose \ndependent manner . The d ata suggest that Centella asiatica  extract prevents ethanol induced gastric \nmucos al lesions by strengthening the mucosal barrier and reducing the damaging effects of free \nradicals (Cheng  & Koo  2000).  \nIn another study, the healing effects of Centella asiatica water extract and asiaticoside on acetic acid \ninduced gastric ulcers in rats w ere examined. Water extract was prepared from Centella asiatica dry \nplant and the concentration of asiaticoside in the water extract was quantitatively determined with the \nuse of high performance liquid chromatography analysis. For the preparation of water  extract, 30 g of  \nCentella asiatica was boiled in 600 ml of distilled water under reflux for one hour. The solution was then filtered and freeze- dried to obtain the powder, which was re- dissolved in distilled water \nimmediately before use . Different concent rations of water extract and asiaticoside were orally \nadministered to rats with kissing ulcers. They were found to reduce the size of the ulcers at day 3 and \n7 in a dose -dependent manner, with a concomitant attenuation of myeloperoxidase activity at the ulcer \ntissues. Epithelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis were on the other hand promoted. The expression \nof basic fibroblast growth factor, an important angiogenic factor, was also up regulated in the ulcer \ntissues in rats treated with CE or asiaticosid e. Similar effects were observed after 0.25 g/kg Centella \nasiatica water extract or 10 mg/kg asiaticoside administration, suggesting that asiaticoside may be the \nmost active ingredient in Centella asiatica  water extract that enhanced ulcer healing.  \nEffects  on cognitive function  \nDifferent doses of aqueous extract (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg) of the whole plant of Centella asiatica \nhave been show n to counter -attack the effect of oxidative stress by decreasing the lipid peroxidation \nand increasing the endogenous a ntioxidant enzymes in brain. For the aqueous extract, coarse powder \nof the plant was extracted with eight parts of water under boiling for 5  hours and filtered to collect the \nextract. The extract was concentrated and finally dried to powder. For the methan olic and chloroform \nextract, the coarse powder of the whole plant was extracted with five parts of methanol at 60 \u201365\u00b0C for  \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 18/44 \n 5 hours and filtered to collect the extract. The extract was concentrated under vacuum and \nconcentration was continued to completely remove the solvent, yielding a viscous liquid. The \npercentage w/w yields of aqueous, methanolic and chloroform extracts were 41, 12. 5 and 1, \nrespectively.  \nOnly the aqueous extract of whole plant (200 mg/kg for 14 days) showed an improvement in learning and memory of male Wistar rats in both shuttle box and step through paradigms.  All doses of aqueous \nextract increased the number of avoidances in shuttle box and prolonged the step through latency in \nstep through apparatus in a dose dependent manner . Only two  doses (200 and 300 mg/kg of aqueous \nextract ) showed significant increase in the step down latency in step down apparatus and transfer \nlatency in elevated plus maze. Among doses of aqueous extract tested on oxidative stress parameters, \nonly 200 and 300 mg/ kg showed a significant decrease in the brain levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) \nwith simultaneous significant increase in levels of glutathione. There was a significant increase in the \nlevels of catalase at the 300 mg/kg but no significant change in superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels \nwas observed. These findings suggest that the aqueous extract of Centella asiatica has  cognitive \nenhancing effect and that an antioxidant mechanism could be involved (Veerendra Kumar & Gupta \n2002).  \nCognitive impairment in epileptics may be a consequence of the epileptogenic process as well as \nantiepileptic medication. The effect of aqueous extract of Centella asiatica (100 and 300 mg/kg) was \nevaluated on the course of kindling development, kindling -induced learning deficit and oxidative stress \nmarkers in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindled rats. The whole plant was dried and coarsely ground with \na grinder. For the preparation of the aqueous extract, the coarse powder of the plant was extracted \nwith 8 parts of water under boiling for 5  hours and was filtered through a 400- mesh cloth to collect the \nextract. The extract was concentrated and finally spray dried to get a greenish brown  powder . The \npercentage w/w yield of aqueous extract was 41. The loss on drying at 105\u00b0C and the ash content  of \nthe powder were 5% and 8% w/w, respectively. The concentration of the known active component, \nasiaticoside, was determined by HPLC and was found to be 3% w/w. Male Wistar rats were injected \nPTZ (30 mg/kg i.p.) once every  alternate day (48 \u00b1 2 h) until the development of the kindling. The \nadministration of Centella asiatica aqueous extract (300 mg/kg orally) decreased the PTZ -kindled \nseizures and showed improvement in the learning deficit induced by PTZ kindling as evidenced by \ndecreased seizure score an d increased latencies in passive avoidance behaviour. However, low dose of \nthe Centella asiatica aqueous extract (100 mg/kg) showed improvement only in the learning deficit due \nto the kindling and failed to improve the seizure score. The findings suggest t he potential of aqueous \nextract of Centella asiatica aqueous extract as adjuvant to antiepileptic drugs with an added advantage \nof preventing cognitive impairment (Gupta et al.  2003).\n \nSwiss albino mice were  injected orally with water (weight to volume ratio of 1:3) whole plant Centella \nasiatica extract 200 mg/kg for 15 days from day 15 to day 30 post partum (p.p.) and the nootropic \neffect was  evaluated on the 31st day and 6 months p.p. Behavioural (open field, dark/bright arena, \nhole board and radial arm maze tests), biochemical  (acetylcholine esterase activity) and histological \nstudies (dendritic arborisation) were carried out. Performance of juvenile and young adult  mice was \nsignificantly improved in radial arm maze and hole board tests. Treatment resulted  in increased \nacetylcholine esterase activity in the hippocampus. Dendritic arborisation of hippocampal CA3  neurons \nwas also increased in terms of intersections and branching points, both at one month and 6 months. \nResults of this investigation showed that treatment during postnatal developmental stage with Centella \nasiatica extract can influence the neuronal morphology and  promote the higher brain function of \njuvenile and young adult mice (Rao et al.  2005) .  \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 19/44 \n Psychoneuro -pharmacological profile  \nAnxiolytic plants may interact with either glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) or GABA transaminase \n(GABA -T) and ultimately influence brain GABA levels and neurotransmission. The purpose of a study \nwas to determine the possible influence on the primary brain enzymes responsible for \u03b3 -aminobutyric \nacid (GABA) metabolism. Two in vitro rat brain homogenate assays were developed to determine the \ninhibitory concentrations (IC 50) of aqueous and ethanolic plant extracts. Extracts from Centella asiatica \n(gotu Kola) stimulated GAD  activity by over 40% at a dose of 1 mg/ ml. The alcoholic Centella asiatica \nextract dose -dependently increased the GABA level in rats. The stimulatory effect of the Centella \nasiatica extract and the anticonvulsant agent valproic acid on this inhibitory tra nsmitter in the central \nnervous system was inhibited by the specific GABA -antagonist bicuculline methionine. When the \nstimulating effect of GABA was inhibited by bicuculline methionine, no anti- ulcerative effect of either \nCentella asiatica extract or valpr oic acid was demonstrable ( Awad et al. 2007).  \nAxonal regeneration is important for functional recovery following nerve damage. Centella asiatica herb \nhas been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries  as a nerve tonic. It has been shown that Centella \nasiati ca ethanolic extract (100  \u03bcg/ml) elicits a marked  increase in neurite outgrowth in human SH -\nSY5Y cells in the presence of nerve  growth factor (NGF). A water extract of Centella was ineffective at \n100 \u03bcg/ml. Sub fractions of Centella  ethanolic extract, obtained through silica gel ch romatography, \nwere tested (100 \u03bcg/ml) for neurite elongation in the presence of NGF. High est activity was found with \na non polar fraction (GKF4). Relatively polar fractions (GKF10 to GKF13) also showed activity, albeit \nless than GKF4 . Asiatic acid, a trite rpenoid compound found in Centella ethanolic extract and GKF4, \nshowed marked activity at 1 \u03bcM. Asiatic acid was not present in GKF10 to GKF13, further indicating that other active components must be present. Neurite elongation by asiatic acid was completely blocked by the extracellular -signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway inhibitor PD 098059 (10\u03bcM). Male \nSprague- Dawley rats given Centella ethanolic extract in their drinking water (300 -330 mg/ kg daily) \ndemonstrated more rapid functional recovery and increas ed axonal regeneration (larger calibre axons \nand greater numbers of myelinated axons) compared with controls, indicating that the axons grew at a \nfaster rate. The findings above indicate that components in Centella ethanolic extract may be useful for \naccelerating repair of damaged neurons (Soumyanath et al.  2005) . \nThe effect during the rat growth spurt period of Centella asiatica fresh leaf extract treatment on the \ndendritic morphology of hippocampal CA3 neurons, one of the regions of the brain concerned wi th \nlearning and memory, was investigated. Fresh leaf juice was extracted from these leaves after washing, air -drying and homogeni sing in a glass vessel and finally filtering through a sterile gauge \ncloth. Neonatal rat pups (7 days old) were fed with 2, 4 o r 6 ml /kg body weight of fresh leaf extract of \nCentella asiatica for 2, 4 or 6 weeks. The results showed a significant increase in the dendritic length (intersections) and dendritic branching points along the length of both apical and basal dendrites in rats treated with 4 and 6 ml /kg body weight per day of Centella asiatica for longer periods of time (i.e. \n4 and 6 weeks). The authors concluded that the constituents/active principles present in Centella asiatica fresh leaf extract have a neuronal dendritic growth stimulating property; hence, the extract \ncould be used for enhancing neuronal dendrites in stress and neurodegenerative and memory disorders (Mohandas Rao et al. 2006) . \nThe role of Centella asiatica fresh leaf extract treatment on the dendritic morp hology of hippocampal \nCA3 neurons, one of the regions concerned with learning and memory, in adult rats, has been investigated. Rats (2.5 months old) were fed with 2, 4 and 6 ml /kg body weight of fresh leaf juice \nextract of Centella asiatica for 2, 4 and 6 weeks, respectively. The fresh leaf juice was fed to the rats \nas such, through a gastric tube, a capillary tube attached to a 1 -ml hypodermic syringe. After the \ntreatment period, the rats were killed, brains were removed and hippocampal neurons were \nimpre gnated with silver nitrate (Golgi staining). Hippocampal CA3 neurons were traced  using camera  \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 20/44 \n lucida, and dendritic branching points (a measure of dendritic arborisation) and intersections (a \nmeasure  of dendritic length) were quantified. The results showed a significant increase in the dendritic \nlength (intersections) and dendritic branching points along the length of both apical and basal \ndendrites in rats treated with 6 m l/kg body weight/day of Centella asiatica for 6 weeks. However, the \nrats treated with  2 and 4 ml/kg body weight/day for 2 and 4 weeks did not show any significant \nchange in hippocampal CA3 neuronal dendritic arborisation. The authors concluded that constituents \npresent in Centella asiatica fresh leaf extract has neuronal dendritic growth s timulating properties. \n(Gadahad et al. 2008).  \nA study reports that phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) is \nenhanced in both a neuroblastoma cell line expressing amyloid beta 1 \u201342 (A\u03b2) and in rat embryonic \ncortical primary cell culture. The study suggest also that ERK/RSK signalling pathway might mediate \nthis effect of Gotu Kola water extract (Xu et al.  2008).  \nAntimicrobial effects  \nAntibacterial effects  against Pseudomonas  pyocyaneus , Trichoderma  mentagrophytes  and Entamoeba \nhistolytica  have been demonstrated. Both the alcoholic and the aqueous extract of Centella asiatica \ndeveloped also an antiviral action against type II Herpes simplex  virus.  \nCentella asiatica, has been used in India  in leprosy patients. It is considered that asiaticoside, acts on \nthe waxy covering of M. leprae. The in vitro effect of an indigenously produced dry powder of Centella \nasiatica on the acid -fastness and viability of M. tuberculosis  was investigated showing  that Centella \nasiatica may not have any direct action on the acid -fastness or viability of M. tuberculosis  H37Rv in \nvitro. For this study Centella asiatica stock solution was prepared by weighing 60 mg of the powder of \nCentella asiatica and dissolving it in 3 ml  of M/15 phosphate buffer pH 7.0 (Herbert et al. 1994) .  \nThe a ntibacterial activity of an ethanolic  Centella asiatica extract at concentrations of 100, 200, 300 \nand 400 mg/ml against a battery of enteric pathogens was studied. The inhibitory  effect of the extract \nwas best demonstrated at a concentration  of 400 mg/ml. The results of this study indicate the \nantimicrobial  activity of Centella asiatica against the enteropathogens and suggest its  potential as an \nantidiarrhoeal drug (Mamtha et al.  2004) .  \nThe antimicrobial activity of dried leaves Centella asiatica methanolic extract against five bacteria \nstrains was assessed by the presence or absence of inhibition zones and MIC values. Centella asiatica \nmethanol extract has potential antibacterial activity to both gram positive S. aureus ATCC 25923 and \nmethicillin resistant S. aureus No antibacterial activities to gram  negative E. coli ATCC 25922, K. \npneumoniae (IMR K25/96) and P. aeruginosa  ATCC 27853 (Zaidan et al.  2005) . \nImmuno -modulatory effects  \nImmuno -modulatory activity of methanol extracts of whole plant of Centella asiatica (0.18% of \nasiaticoside) at five dose levels (dose -response relationship) ranging from 100 to 500 mg/kg body \nweight using carbon clearance, antibody titer and cyclophosphamide imm unosuppression parameters. \nCentella asiatica, significantly increase d the phagocytic index and total WBC count. The F ratio of the \nphagocytic index was also significant (Jayathirtha & Mishra  2004) . \nImmunological activity of a pectin extracted from Centella asiatica containing arabinose, rhamnos e, \ngalactose, xylose and galacturonic acid was also studied. After deacetylation and carboxyl -reduction, \nthe pectin and its degraded product showed immunostimulating activity to different extent in vitro. The results suggested that the carboxyl and acetyl groups play important roles in the expression of \nimmunological activity (Wang et al.  2005).   \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 21/44 \n A study focused on the influence of whole fresh Centella asiatica extract on cell -mediated and humoral \nimmune responses was carried out. Centella asiatica water  extract significantly increased proliferation \nand the production of IL -2 and  TNF-\u03b1 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In \ncontrast, an ethanol extract of Centella asiatica inhibited human PBMC mitogenesis and the production \nof IL-2 and  TNF-\u03b1. BALB/c mice treated with Centella asiatica  extracts (100 mg/kg body weight ) \nshowed higher responses to both primary and secondary antibodies against BSA when compared with \nnon-treated group. The study shows immuno -modulating activity of Centella asiatica extracts with \nregard to both non -specific cellular and humoral immune responses (Punturee et al.  2005) . \nAntinociceptive and anti -inflammatory effects  \nThe antinociceptive activity of the whole plant water extract of Centella asiatica (10, 30, 100 and 300  mg/kg) was studied using acetic acid -induced writhing and hot -plate method in mice. The anti-\ninflammatory activity of Centella asiatica was studied in rats by prostaglandin E 2-induced paw oedema. \nWater extract of Centella asiatica revealed significant antin ociceptive activity with both the models. The \nactivity was statistically similar to aspirin but less potent than morphine. The Centella asiatica extract \nalso revealed significant anti- inflammatory activity. This effect was statistically similar to the non -\nsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug, mefenamic acid (Somchit et al.  2004) . \nCardiovascular effects  \nThe alcoholic extract of Centella asiatica whole plant was evaluated for cardioprotective activity against ischemia- reperfusion induced myocardial infarction in rats. Cardioprotective activity was studied by \nmeasuring infarct size and estimating lipid peroxide levels in serum and heart tissue. Freshly collected \nCentella asiatica whole plant was dried under shade and the dried material was milled to obtain a \ncoarse  powder. The alcoholic extract of the powder was prepared by a process of continuous extraction \nsuch that 1  g of alcoholic extract equivalent to 5.88  g of crude drug was obtained. A dose (100\u2013 1000 \nmg/kg) dependent reduction in percent left ventricle necros is (PLVN) as well as in lipid peroxide levels \nwas observed in rats treated with alcoholic extract of Centella asiatica  orally for 7 days compared to \ncontrol animals (Pragada et al.  2004) . \nThe in vitro effects of a methanol extract from the aerial parts of Centella asiatica on shear -induced \nplatelet activation and coagulation were assessed after oral administration to rats, by subjecting non -\nanticoagulated  blood to haemostatometry. Amongst the isolated constituents, only 3,5 -di-O-\ncaffeoylquinic acid showed significant inhibition of shear -induced platelet activation  and dynamic \ncoagulation. The reactive curve of the inhibitory effect on the platelet reaction and the dynamic  \ncoagulation showed a bell- shape (Satake et al.  2007) . \nAnti-tumoral activity (antiproliferative effects)  \nThe anti -tumour effects of the methanolic crude extract of Centella asiatica as well as of its partially \npurified fractions (AF) have been investigated both in vitro short and long term chemosensitivity and in \nvivo tumour model test system s. Dried powder of the plant was extracted twice with 50 ml of 80 % \nmethanol. Fractions dose dependently inhibited the proliferation of the transformed cell lines significantly more than did the methanolic crude extract and other solvent fractions. No toxic  effects \nwere detected in normal human lymphocytes. AF also significantly suppressed the multiplication of \nmouse lung fibroblast (L -929) cells at a concentration of 8 micrograms/ml in long term culture. Oral \nadministration of the extracts (methanolic crude  extract and AF) retarded the development of solid and \nascites tumours and increased the life span of these tumour bearing mice. Tritiated thymidine, uridine and leucine incorporation assay suggested that the fraction acts directly on DNA synthesis. In add ition, \nthe oral administration of methanolic crude extract and AF to normal as well as transplanted tumour  \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 22/44 \n bearing mice did not produce any toxic symptoms even at high concentrations (500 mg/mouse) (Babu \net al. 1995).  \nEffects of the fresh plant water extra ct of Centella asiatica on formation of azoxymethane (AOM) -\ninduced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and intestinal tumorigenesis in male F344 rats were investigated. \nThe yield of water extract from fresh  plant was 2.5%. Treatment with the extract significantly \ndecreased the number of  larger ACF (with four or more crypts per focus) in the large intestine in the \nearly stage, while the number of methylated DNA  adducts was not decreased compared with that in \nthe AOM -treated group. In the post -initiation stage, the extract significantly  decreased the total \nnumber of ACF and the number of larger ACF, accompanied by a decrease in the 5- bromo -20-\ndeoxyuridinelabeling index and an increase in the induction of apoptotic cells in the colonic mucosa. \nThe incidences of neoplasms , the numbers  of adenocarcinomas in the small intestines and entire \nintestines, and sizes of neoplasms in the entire intestines in rats fed Centella asiatica extract at a dose \nof 10mg/kg were smaller than those in rats given AOM alone (p < 0.05). The extra ct at a dose of 100 \nmg/kg significantly  reduced the multiplicity of neoplasms in the small intestine (p < 0.05). These \nresults suggest that inhibition of the formation  of AOM -induced ACF by Centella asiatica extract is \nassociated with modification of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in  colonic crypts and that \nthe extract has a chemo -preventive effect on colon tumorigenesis (Bunpo et al.  2004) . \nYoshida et al. investigated on the antiproliferative constituents in the methanolic extract from the \naerial parts of Centella asiatica. The air -dried aerial parts of  Centella asiatica (722.7 g) were extracted \nwith MeOH at  room temperature. The MeOH solution was concentrated in vacuo to give a dark green \nsyrup (109.0 g). Activity -guided fractionation of met hanolic extract resulted in the isolation of ursolic \nacid lactone, ursolic acid, pomolic acid, 2 a,3a-dihydroxyurs -12-en-28-oic acid, 3 -epimaslinic acid, \nasiatic acid, corosolic acid, and rosmarinic acid. Antiproliferative activity of the isolated compounds  \nagainst human gastric adenocarcinoma (MK -1), human uterine carcinoma (HeLa), and murine \nmelanoma (B16F10) cells was estimated. The fraction containing rosmarinic acid had the major \nconcentration -dependent activity (Yoshida et al. 2005) . \nAntimutagenic effe cts  \nThe antimutagenic effect of aqueous  extracts of Centella asiatica was studied with the cytogenetic \nassay in somatic cells for the in vivo  identification of chromosomal aberration and micronuclei in \nsomatic cells (bone marrow cells) of mice.  The modula ting effects on the genetic damage induced by \ncyclophosphamide, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug which is a known mutagen and chromium \n(potassium dichromate) an extensively used metal were investigated.  The results showed that the \nCentella asiatica ha s a moderate antimutagenic nature against the cyclophosphamide and chromium \n(Cr) induced genotoxicity (Edwin et al.  2000) . \nAsiaticoside - various effects  \nThe activity of asiaticoside, saponin component isolated from Centella asiatica,  was studied in normal  \nas well as delayed -type wound healing. In guinea pig punch wounds topical applications of 0.2% \nsolution of asiaticoside produced 56% increase in hydroxyproline, 57% increase in tensile strength, increased collagen content and better epithelisation. In str eptozotocin diabetic rats, where healing is \ndelayed, topical application of 0.4% solution of asiaticoside over punch wounds increased \nhydroxyproline content, tensile strength, collagen content and epithelisation thereby facilitating the \nhealing. Asiaticosi de was active by the oral route also at 1 mg/kg dose in the guinea pig punch wound \nmodel. It promoted angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane model at 40 mg/disk concentration (Shukla  et al. 1999).   \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 23/44 \n The putative anxiolytic activity of asiaticosid e was examined in male mice by using a number of \nexperimental paradigms of anxiety, with diazepam being as a positive anxiolytic control. In the \nelevated plus -maze test, diazepam (1 and 2 mg/kg) or asiaticoside (5 or 10 mg/kg) increased the \npercentage of entries into open arms and of time spent on open arms. In the light/dark test, as with 1 mg/kg diazepam, asiaticoside (10 and 20 mg/kg) increased the time spent in the light area and the movement in the light area without altering the total locomotor activity of the animals. In the hole -\nboard test, asiaticoside at 10 mg/kg significantly increased head -dipping counts and duration as well \nas diazepam (0.3 mg/kg). These findings indicated that asiaticoside exhibited an anxiolytic -like effect \n(Chen et al. 2006).  \nA study assessed the effects of Gotu Kola plant materials of different genotypic origin; hexane, ethyl \nacetate and methanolic extracts of Gotu Kola; and asiaticoside (3, 5 and 10 mg/kg body w eight). \nVarious paradigms were used to assess the anxiolytic act ivity, including the elevated plus maze (EPM), \nopen field, social interaction, locomotor activity, punished drinking (Vogel Test) and novel cage tests. The EPM test revealed that Gotu Kola, its methanol and ethyl acetate extracts as well as the pure \nasiati coside, imparted anxiolytic activity. Furthermore, the asiaticoside did not affect locomotor \nactivity, suggesting this compound does not have sedative effects in rodents (Wijeveera  et al. 2006) . \nAsiaticoside  has been shown to induce type I collagen synthes is in human dermal fibroblast cells. \nHowever, the mechanism underlying asiaticoside -induced type I collagen synthesis, especially at a \nmolecular level, remains only partially understood. The conclusions of a study conducted on cultured human dermal fibrobl ast cells suggest that asiaticoside can induce type I collagen synthesis via the \nactivation of the T \u03b2R1 kinase -independent Smad pathway\n (Lee et al. 2006).  \nThe application of asiaticoside at low doses of 10\u22128 to 10\u221212% (w/w) facilitated burn wound repair. To \nclarify the accelerating mechanisms of asiaticoside on burn wound repair, the effects of asiaticoside on the levels of various cytokines produced at the site of the burn wound was examined. The topical \napplication of a low dose (10 pg, 1 ng, or 100 ng/wound area) of asiaticoside increased monocyte \nchemo -attractant protein -1 (MCP -1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and interleukin (IL) -1\u03b2 \nlevels in burn wound exudates. Asiaticoside (10 pg to 100 ng/ml) enhanced MCP -1 production in \nHaCaT cells, but it had no direct effect on VEGF production. Furthermore, asiaticoside (10 pg to 100  ng/ml) increased the IL -1\u03b2 production in THP -1 macrophages  with MCP -1, but it had no effect on \nIL-1\u03b2 production without MCP -1 or with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Findings suggest that the \nenhancement of burn wound healing by asiaticoside might be due to the promotion of angiogenesis during skin wound repair as a re sult of the stimulation of VEGF production caused by the increase in \nMCP-1 expression in keratinocytes and the increase in IL -1\u03b2 expression in macrophages induced \ncooperatively by asiaticoside plus MCP -1 (Kimura  et al. 2008) . \nIn vivo  studies in rats have shown that asiaticoside given subcutaneously exhibits a protective action \nagainst stress- induced gastric ulcers and orally administered accelerates the healing of chemical -\ninduced duodenal ulcers (Barnes et al.  2007).   \nOther effects  \nRadiation injury to the skin (radiation dermatitis) is one of the major limiting factors in radiotherapy. Rats were irradiated and treated with the product Madecassol\u00ae (an ointment containing TTFA or TECA) \nat the dose of 16 mg per cm\n2 skin per day or with Tetrandine a bisbenyliso quinoline alkaloid from the \ndried root of Stephania tetrandra  at the dose of 1.6 mg per cm2 skin per day or with vaseline. The \nacute skin reaction in Madecassol\u00ae treated rats appeared earlier but less severe than in control group \ntreated with vaseline (1%) . At the high dose irradiation the healing effect of tetrandine was better than \nMadecassol\u00ae and vaseline. Histological observations suggested that Madecassol\u00ae was able to reduce \nacute radiation action probably through anti- inflammatory activity (Chen et al . 1999).   \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 24/44 \n Psoriasis is a hyperproliferative skin disorder estimated to be present in 1 \u20133% of most populations. A \nrapid-throughput, in vitro bioassay has been utilised to examine plants for inhibitory effects on the \ngrowth of SVK -14 keratinocytes. Centella asiatica has been compared against the psoralen -containing \nseeds of Psoralea corylifolia  and the synthetic anti -psoriatic agent dithranol (anthralin). Dried ground \nplant material, (2 g), was boiled for 30 minutes in distilled water (50 ml). The extract was  freeze dried \nto 306 mg and 210 mg from Centella asiatica  and Psoralea corylifolia  respectively. An appropriate \nportion of each residue was reconstituted in water (2.5 ml) and passed through wet \npolyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) packed to a height of 1 cm in  a syringe, followed by elution with \ndistilled water (10ml).  Aqueous extracts of Psoralea corylifolia  and Centella asiatica inhibited \nkeratinocyte replication with IC 50 values of 18.4 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcg/ml and 209.9 \u00b1 9.8 mg/ml respectively prior \nto treatment with polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) and 36.3 \u00b1 3.3 mg/ml and 238.0 \u00b1 2.5 mg/ml \nrespectively after PVPP treatment of the extracts. The effect produced by Centella asiatica was unlikely \nto be due t o phenolic compounds. The authors hypothesis ed that could be due to its two constituents, \ntriterpenoid glycosides madecassoside and asiaticoside, and suggest the potential use of Centella \nasiatica extracts as a topical anti -psoriatic agent (Sampson et al.  2001) . \n3.2.  Overview of available pharmacokinetic data regarding the herbal \nsubstance(s), herbal preparation(s) and relevant constituents thereof  \nPharmacokinetic s \nNo information is available on Centella asiatica extracts.   \nIn animal experiments, an in vivo  transformation of asiaticoside into asiatic acid was established. T he \nmaximum plasma concentration of asiatic acid increases significantly with increasing dose \nadministrated, while the time point of maximum plasma concentration and the elimination half -life \ndoes not significantly change with increasing dose.  In comparison with a single oral administration, \nrepeated oral doses have been shown to significantly increase the maximum plasma concentration and the elimination half -life. The possible mechanism behind t his accumulation phenomenon is a \nmodification of asiaticoside metabolism induced by the prolonged administration of TTFCA.  \nThe comparison of oral and subcutaneous administration of madecassoside, asiaticoside, asiatic acid and madecassic acid in rats reve als a bio -availability varying between 30%  and 50%  (Brinkhaus  et al. \n2000).\n \nMadecassic acid crosses the skin rapidly but only to a limited extent. The plasma concentration did not \nexceed 0.02 to 0.05%  of the initial applied concentration. Madecassoside is at the skin application site \nonly 0.04%  of the applied dose at 1 hour and about 0.06%  after 24 hours. For asiatic acid similar \nresults were observed. In man, active ingredients of Centella asiatica are excreted principally by faeces \nin a 24 -76 hour period;  smaller quantities are eliminated through the kidneys (EMEA 1 998).  \nNeither a possible pharmacokinetic difference between aqueous and alcoholic extracts, nor a difference \nbetween the forms of application has been investigated (Brinkhaus et al.  2000) . \nNo pharmacokinetic interactions with other medicinal products are known.  \n3.3.  Overview of available toxicological data regarding the herbal \nsubstance(s)/herbal preparation(s) and constituents thereof  \nSingle/repeat dose toxicity  \nIn the mouse, acute toxicity was not shown for oral administration of 1 g/kg body weight of an \nethanolic 50 % extract of Centella. Following intraperitoneal administration, the maximum tolerated  \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 25/44 \n dose (MTD) in mice was found by Dhar et al.  (1968) to be 250 mg/kg body weight . Alcoholic extracts \nof Gotu Kola have shown no toxicity at doses of 350 mg/kg when given i.p. to rats (Alternative \nMedicine Review 2007).  \nThe oral LD50 of a 70%  ethanolic dry extract from Centella 6:1 in rats was found to be higher than \n675 mg/kg body weight (ESCOP 2009).  \nIn mice, a dose of 1 g/ kg body weight  of an alcoholic (50:50) Centella asiatica extract did not lead to \nany toxic effects (no raw data are available). No mortality were recorded. High concentrations of \nasiaticoside applied on derma did not give rise to any s igns of systemic toxicity.  \nChronic oral administration of the extract to rats at 150 mg/kg for 30 days led to no significant \ndifferences in body weight or consumption of food and water, nor to changes in plasma glucose, \nproteins, cholesterol or triglycerid levels, compared to controls. No macroscopic alteration in internal \norgans was evident (ESCOP 2009).  \nRepeated topical application of an asiaticoside mixture has been associated with a tumour -growth -\npromoting effect in mice Laerum and Iversen (1972). Sinc e empirical material is lacking , it is not \npossible to extrapolate the data to humans.  \nCytoxicity and genotoxicity and antimutagenic effects  \nCytotoxic, genotoxic and antimutagenic effects of Centella asiatica water extracts have been \ninvestigated on Salmo nella typhimurium  TA98 and TA100 and in human lymphocytes. Edible parts of \neight plants were washed well with water. The p lant (300 g) was homogeni sed with 300 ml distilled \nwater using a home -mixer, and the mixture was then centrifuged at 4\u00b0C, 9000 g for 30 min utes. The \nsupernatants of the  extract was freeze -dried and then stored at - 20\u00b0C. Centella asiatica showed anti -\nmutagenic activity in the Ames test and any toxic activity (Yen et al.  2001).  \nPure triterpenoids of Centella asiatica have been reported to cause alteration in gene expression in \nhuman fibroblast and recently asiaticoside has been shown to induce type I collagen synthesis in \nhuman dermal fibroblast . Leaf samples dried in the dark at 50\u00b0C for 48 hours  were powdered. Powder \n(1 g) was extracted b y sonication (3\u00d710 min) with 3\u00d710 ml of 90% MeOH. The dried crude extract \nwas dissolved in 90% MeOH and filtered (pore size: 0.45 \u03bcm) prior to HPLC analysis \n(Randriamampionona  et al. 2007) . \nAsiaticoside has been implicated as a possible skin carcinogen in rodents after repeated topical \napplication. Asiaticoside was tested for carcinogenicity by topical applications to the skin of hairless \nmice. A short -term tetrazolium test indicated that compound was weak carcinogens. The compound \nwas painted twice weekly on the dorsal skin up to about 20 months; some of the mice had previously \nbeen initiated with a small dose of 20 -methylcholanthrene (MCA). A control group which received only \nthe solvent benzene after MCA initiation was also studied. These carcinomas did n ot appear before \nabout 16 months of observation. Before this, the painted, MCA -initiated animals had a significantly \nlower number of papillomas of the skin than the corresponding control group with only benzene \ntreatment. By systematic autopsy it was found  that about 30% of the corresponding MCA -initiated, \nbenzene or asiaticoside -treated animals had such neoplasms. Asiaticoside was used at a concentration \nof 0.10% in benzene. Asiaticoside dissolved in benzene gave an increased yield of papillomas and also 2.5% skin sarcomas of the animals, indicating an effect on the dermis as well. Asiaticoside did not \nproduce necrosis or acantholysis of the skin and did not appear to be toxic (Laerum & Iversen 1972).  \nThe antigenotoxic effect of Centella asiatica extract wa s studied on human lymphocytes using \nchromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges as parameters against the genotoxic effect induced by cyproterone acetate (CPA), a synthetic progestin known to be not only a genotoxic agent  \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 26/44 \n but also a tumour initiating agent. Centella asiatica leaves were collected, dried and ground to fine \npowder. Extraction was performed by soaking samples (30 gm of dry weight) in  300 ml of acetone for \n8\u201310 hours at 40\u201360\u00b0C in Soxhlet\u2019s apparatus.  A clear dose dependent decrease in the genotoxic \ndamage of CPA was observed, suggesting a protective role of Centella asiatica extract during CPA therapy. The results suggest that the leaf extract per se does not have genotoxic potential, but can \nmodulate the genotoxicity of CPA on huma n lymphocytes in vitro (Siddique et al. 2008).  \nLocal tolerance  \nA sensiti sing effect of the triterpene fraction potential cause of allergic contact dermatitis has been \nconfirmed in animal experiments. Skin hyperkeratinisation at the application site has bee n observed \nafter the application of high concentrations of asiaticoside applied on derma (EMEA 1998).  \nReproductive toxicity  \nPoor information without details is available on reproductive toxicity and teratogenicity. In vitro fertility \ninvestigations indicat e a detrimental effect of asiaticoside on human and rat sperm. Orally \nadministered crude extract of Centella asiatica has been reported to significantly reduce fertility of \nfemale mice. Teratogenicity studies in rabbit with Centella asiatica extracts repor ted negative results \n(EMEA 1998).  \nIn vitro anti-infertility activity against human and rat sperm has been described for the total saponin \nfraction. Asiaticoside and brahminoside are thought to be active components, although no spermicidal \nor spermostatic action has been demonstrated for the pure saponins. A crude Centella extract has \nbeen reported to significantly reduce the fertility of female mice when orally administered.  \nTeratogenicity studies were conducted in rabbits and they reported negative resul ts for Centella extract \ncontaining asiatic acid, madecassic acid, madasiatic acid and asiaticoside (Barnes et al.  2007).  \n3.4.  Overall conclusions on non -clinical data \n3.4.1.  Pharmacodynamics  \nCentella asiatica extracts  \nSeveral pharmacological activities of Centella asi atica extracts and of its chemical constituent \nasiaticoside have been observed in the laboratory animals.  \nStudies on wound healing and collagen -proliferative effects, angiogenetic activity and \nantioxidant activity : \nBoth topical (alcoholic extract) and sys temic (by oral route) treatments with Centella asiatica extracts \naccelerate wound healing by stimulating epithelisation. The mechanisms involved seem to be: \nenhancement of collagen synthesis, stimulation of angiogenesis and antioxidant activity. These \nmech anisms are probably involved in the beneficial effects of Centella asiatica extracts in the \ntreatment of chronic venous sufficiency . \nA concentration -dependent antioxidant activity of various Centella asiatica extracts (ethanol, water and \nlight petroleum) w as observed. Ethanolic extracts seem to have the higher antioxidant activity followed \nby water extracts. Also methanolic extracts exert in vitro antioxidant activity. Phenolic compounds \nappear as main contributors to the antioxidative activities of Centell a asiatica.   \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 27/44 \n Studies on ulcer -protective and anti -ulcer effects, effects on cognitive function, \npsychoneuro -pharmacological profile, antimicrobial effects, immuno -modulatory effects, \nantinociceptive and anti -inflammatory effects, antiproliferative effects, antimutagenic \neffects : \nEthanolic and water extracts exert ulcer -protective and anti -ulcer effects. An antioxidant mechanism \nhas been suggested for this effect and asiaticoside may be the most active antiulcer ingredient.   \nAqueous Centella asiatica extracts showed improvement in learning and memory apparently associated \nto antioxidant effects. At the same doses Centella asiatica is a potential adjuvant to antiepileptic drugs \nwith the added advantage of preventing cognitive impairment. Centella asiatica fresh  leaf juice showed \nto influence the neuronal morphology and  to enhance memory retention of neonatal rats.  \nThe psychoneuro -pharmacological activity includes anxiolytic -like effects (stimulating effect of GABA \nshown in vitro with ethanolic extract),  improve ment of recovery and increased axonal regeneration \nafter nerve damage (orally administered ethanolic extract), and neuronal dendritic growth stimulating \nproperty (orally administered fresh juice leaf extract) in brain areas involved in memory and learning \nprocesses. It has been suggested that the ERK/RSK signalling pathway mediate central effects.  \nBoth ethanolic and water extracts of Centella asiatica showed antibacterial effects against \nPseudomonas pyocyaneus, Trichoderma  mentagrophytes , Entamoeba histoly tica and antiviral action \nagainst type II Herpes simplex  virus. Due to  its activity against the enteropathogens , the Ethanolic \nCentella asiatica extract has been suggested as an antidiarrhoeal drug.  \nThe Centella asiatica methanolic extract has potential an tibacterial activity to both gram positive S. \naureus ATCC 25923 and methicillin resistant S. aureus .  \nImmuno -modulating activity with regard to both non -specific cellular and humoral immune responses \nhas been shown with both ethanolic and water Centella asiatica extracts. Positive immuno- modulatory \neffects were demonstrated also with methanolic extracts. Effects on immune system could be due to a \npectin contained in Centella asiatica.  \nAntinociceptive and anti- inflammatory effects of water extract of Centell a asiatica were shown in a \nsingle study in rats.  \nCardiovascular effects are described includ ing studies showing cardioprotection with an ethanolic \nextract and anti -aggregation of platelets activity of a methanolic extract.   \nConcentration -dependent  anti-tumoral activity was shown in vitro with methanolic crude extract of \nCentella asiatica. Fractions of extracts containing rosmarinic acid have the highest anti-tumoral \nactivity.  \nA single experiment shows that a water extract of Centella asiatica is moderatel y antimutagenic \nagainst cyclophosphamide and chromium (Cr) induced genotoxicity.  \nWater extracts of Centella asiatica exert in vitro anti-hyperproliferative effects on keratinocytes \nsuggesting the potential use of Centella asiatica extracts as a topical an ti-psoriatic agent.  \nAsiaticoside  \nAsiaticoside exerts wound healing, anxiolytic and antiulcer effects. Wound healing might be due to the \nstimulation of angiogenesis as a result of the stimulation of VEGF production and the induction of type \nI collagen syn thesis probably via the activation of the T \u03b2R1 kinase -independent Smad pathway.  \nIn conclusion, pharmacological studies show that Centella asiatica extracts and its main compound \npossesses different pharmacobiological properties. Among these, the most important are  wound \nhealing, antiulcer properti es, and nootropic -like effects.  Pre-clinical pharmacological studies  \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 28/44 \n designed to clar ify the mechanism of action of Centella asiatica in treatment of CVI  have not been \nperformed, however,  induction of type I collagen synthesis  induced by asiaticoside could  explain some \npositive effects.  \n3.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  \nIn humans, after single oral administration of TTFCA 30 -60 mg, asiatic acid reaches maximum plasma \nlevels at  about 4.2-4.5 hours. Plasma half -live is about 2.2-3.4 hours. No detectable saponin is present \n24 hours after single dosing. After repeated doses higher peak plasma concentrations, longer half -\nlives, and greater area -under -the curve  values are observed. In animal experiments, an in vivo , \ntransformation of asiaticoside into asiatic acid occurs. After or al or subcutaneous administration of \nmadecassoside, asiaticoside, asiatic acid and madecassic acid in rats, the bio -availability is varying \nbetween 30%  and 50% , respectively.  \nMinimal cutaneous absorption of active principles has been demonstrated. Active ingredients of \nCentella asiatica have minimal dermal absorption and they are excreted principally by faeces except for smaller quantities through the kidneys. No pharmacokinetic interactions are reported.  \nIn animal experiments, an in vivo  transformation of asiaticoside into asiatic acid was established. T he \nmaximum plasma concentration of asiatic acid increases significantly with increasing dose administrated, while the time point of maximum plasma concentration and the elimination half -life \ndoes not significantly change with increasing dose.\n In comparison with a single oral administration, \nrepeated oral doses have been shown to significantly increase the maximum plasma concentration and the elimination half -life. The possible mechanism behind this accumula tion phenomenon is a \nmodification of asiaticoside metabolism induced by the prolonged administration of TTFCA.  \nThe comparison of oral and subcutaneous administration of madecassoside, asiaticoside, asiatic acid and madecassic acid in rats reveals a bio -availability varying between 30%  and 50%  (Vogel et al. \n1990).\n \n3.4.3.  Toxicology  \nCentella asiatica water extract showed anti -mutagenic activity.  Pure triterpenoids of Centella asiatica \nhave been reported to cause alteration in gene expression in human fibroblast s. Repeated topical \napplication of an asiaticoside mixture has been associated with a tumour -growth -promoting effect in \nmice. A recent study suggests that the leaf extract per se  does not have a genotoxic potential.  \nThe sensiti sing effect of the triterpene fra ction could be the potential cause of allergic contact \ndermatitis.  \nNo toxic effects after acute oral administration of 1 g/kg body weight of an ethanolic 50 % extract of \nCentella . Alcoholic extracts of Gotu Kola have shown no toxicity at doses of 350 mg/kg  when given i.p. \nto rats.  \nThe total saponin fraction and asiaticoside cause in vitro detrimental effects on human and rat sperm. \nOrally crude extract of Centella asiatica significantly reduces fertility of female mice. Teratogenicity studies in rabbit with  Centella asiatica extracts reported negative results. Teratogenicity studies were \nconducted in rabbits and they reported negative results for Centella  extract containing asiatic acid, \nmadecassic acid, madasiatic acid and asiaticoside.   \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.)

Overview of pharmacodynamic data regarding the herbal \nsubstance(s)/preparation(s) including data on relevant constituents  \nTTFCA in chronic venous insufficiency (CVI)  \nTTFCA 30 mg twice daily for three months, reduced in humans serum enzymes involved in \nmucopolysaccharide metabolism in  patients with varicose veins  causing a protecting effect.  \nSix studies, 4 of which being RCTs, assessing the efficacy of TTFCA in CVI patients at any stage of the \ndisease have been considered. Overall 357 patient s were enrolled in all six studies. Five of the six \nstudies were randomi sed and results compared with placebo. The endpoints investigated were: \nfiltration rate, PO 2, PCO 2, resting flux, permeability, oedema , ankle swelling, and subjective symptoms. \nThe res ults show that treatment with TTFCA improves the endpoints investigated. The doses used were \nranging between 60 and 180 mg/day generally divided in two or three times during the day. The \nperiod of treatment was between 2 and 8 weeks; the median period of t reatment in the six studies was \nabout 6 weeks; the median period of treatment calculated per  patient was 7.14 weeks (Table 3 ).  \nIn another study the combination of alpha tocopherol, rutin, melilotus, and Centella asiatica (TTFCA) in \nthe treatment of thirty  patients with CVI  randomi sed in two groups of fifteen subjects (control and \ntreatment group) was investigated. Therapeutic efficacy and tolerability have been valued after 15 and \n30 days of treatment. At the end of the observation period, a significant im provement of clinical \nsymptoms was obtained, characterised by a diminution of the sovrafascial oedema (Cataldi et al. 2001) \n(Table 3). \nIncandela et al. published in 2001 a review on the effects of TTFCA in improving venous wall \nalterations in chronic venous hypertension and in protecting the venous endothelium. The authors \nconcluded that TTFCA is active on the microcirculation in venous and diabetic microangiopathy and that \nsigns and symptoms of venous hypertension and oedema are also improved by treatment. The remodelling on collagen synthesis is cited as one of the possible mechanisms of actions of TTFCA in the \nremodelling of echolucent plaques at the carotid and femoral bifurcation. TTFCA was considered safe \nand well tolerated ( Incandela et al. 2001a) . \nA study was designed to evaluate whether TTFCA, was effective, by modulating collagen pr oduction, in \na period of 12 months, increasing the echogenicity of echolucent plaques at the femoral bifurcation. \nTTFCA was used at the dose of 60 mg three times daily (oral tablets). 60 subjects were recruited: 26 \ncompleted the study in the treatment grou p and 24 in the placebo group. No significant changes were \nobserved in controls while a qualitative increase in homogenicity was observed in the TTFCA group. \nPlaque size measured at the beginning and at the end of the study showed a median increase in size, \nin controls (23%; range 0% -44%); it was unchanged in the TTFCA group (variation 7%; 4%- 26%). In \nconclusion in the treatment group plaques increased in echogenicity and in homogenicity; size and \nstenosis remained unchanged. For the authors these observati ons indicate a positive action of TTFCA \non the stabilis ation of hypoechoic, low -density femoral plaques ( Incandela et al. 2001b) .  \nFifty patients with diabetic microangiopathy were studied by laser Doppler flowmetry (measuring skin \nblood flow at rest) (RF) and the venoarteriolar response (VAR), by  transcutaneous PO\n2 and PCO 2 \nmeasurements, and by capillary permeability evaluation (rate of ankle swelling [RAS]). Thirty of these patients were treated for 6 months with TTFCA (60 mg twice daily). A control group of ten patients was treated with placebo and another group of ten patients was left without treatment thus acting as a  \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 30/44 \n second control group. After six months there were no significant changes in the two control groups. \nThere was a significant improvement of microcirculatory parameter in patients treated with TTFCA. RF (abnormally increased at the beginning of the treatment) decreased, and the VAR (impaired at the \nbeginning of the study) improved. PO\n2 increased and PCO 2 decreased the abnormally increased \ncapillary permeability was also improved (de creased). The d ata showed that TTFCA was useful in \ndiabetic microangiopathy by improving microcirculation and decreasing capillary permeability and protects against the deterioration of microcirculation due to diabetic microangiopathy (Cesarone et al.  \n2001) . \n4.1.2.  Assessor\u2019s overall conclusions on pharmacodynamic data regarding \nthe herbal substance(s)/preparation(s) including data on relevant \nconstituents  \nChronic treatment with TTFCA 30 mg, reduced in humans serum enzymes involved in \nmucopolysaccharide metabolism  in patients with varicose veins. TTFCA at oral doses ranging between \n60 and 180 mg/day for a period of treatment between 2 and 8 weeks improves filtration rate, PO 2, \nPCO 2, resting flux, permeability, oedema, ankle swelling in CVI patients.  \nTTFCA improves  venous wall alterations in chronic venous hypertension protecting the venous \nendothelium. TTFCA is active on the microcirculation in venous and diabetic microangiopathy and signs and symptoms of venous hypertension and oedema are also improved by treatmen t. The remodelling \non collagen synthesis is cited as one of the possible mechanisms of actions of TTFCA in the remodelling \nof echolucent plaques at the carotid and femoral bifurcation.  \nFifty patients with diabetic microangiopathy were studied by laser Dopp ler flowmetry (measuring skin \nblood flow at rest) (RF) and the venoarteriolar response (VAR), by transcutaneous PO\n2 and PCO 2 \nmeasurements, and by capillary permeability evaluation (rate of ankle swelling [RAS]). TTFCA (60 mg \ntwice daily) induced a signific ant improvement of microcirculatory parameters: TTFCA decreases \nresting flux (abnormally increased at the beginning of the treatment), and improves VAR (impaired at \nthe beginning of the study); increases PO 2 and decreases PCO 2.  \n4.1.3.  Overview of pharmacokinetic  data regarding the herbal \nsubstance(s)/preparation(s) including data on relevant constituents  \nNo information is available on Centella asiatica extracts.  \nIn a randomi sed cross- over study involving 12 subjects, Grimaldi investigated the absorption \nbehaviour  of TTFCA following both single and repeated oral doses (30 and 60 mg). The results suggest \nthat active ingredients in TTFCA are well absorbed in human volunteers (Grimaldi et al.  1990). After \nsingle oral administration of the extract, maximum plasma levels of asiatic acid were reached at  4.5 \nand 4.2 hours, with 30 and 60 mg, respectively. Plasma half -lives were 2.2 hours in the 30- mg dose \nand 3.4 hours in the 60 -mg dose. No detectable saponin was present 24 hours after single dosing. \nAfter repeated doses ( 7-day treatment) higher peak plasma concentrations, longer half -lives, and \ngreater area -under -the curve  values were observed.  \n \n  \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.)

Clinical studies (case studies and clinical trials)  \nCentella  is stated to be valuable in the tre atment of wide range of ailments, such as: chronic venous \ninsufficiency, periodontitis, ulcer cicatrisation and burns recovery, anxiety, atherosclerosis.  \n This paragraph is  describes  the following studies:  \nA) Reviews of the clinical studies on CVI \nB) Clinical s tudies on the effects on CVI \nC) Clinical studies on other indications (Ulcer cicatrisation and burns recovery; a nxiety; \natherosclerosis)  \nD) A clinical study on psoriasis  \nE) Clinical studies with combined products containing Centella asiatica  (Periodontitis; Mild t o \nmoderate atopic dermatitis)  \nF) Cosmetic studies on skin ageing  \n \nClinical studies were published describing the use of the following preparations containing Centella \nasiatica extracts:  \n- TTFCA (total triterpenoid fraction of Centella asiatica)  \n- TECA (titrated  extract of Centella asiatica );  \n- MADECASSOL\u00ae (gauze ( 10 x 10cm ) impregnated with a mixture of titrated extract of Centella \nasiatica)  \n- The above mentioned extracts are different declaration used to designate the same type of \nextract containing asiaticosides (40 %), asiatic acid (29 -30%), madecassic acid (29 -30%) and \nmadasiatic acid (1%);  \n- Gotu kola extract  \n- Combined product with Alpha tocopherol, Rutin, Melilotus, and Centella asiatica  (TTFCA)  \n- Combined alcoholic extract from Centella asiatica  and Punica granatum   \n- Ointment containing Mahonia aquifolium , Viola tricolor and Centella asiatica  \n  \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 32/44 \n Varicose veins  \nVaricose veins are the most common manifestation of CVI , affecting 25% of women and 15% of men. \nVaricose veins are swollen, twisted, painful veins that have filled with an abnormal collection of blood. \nIn normal veins, valves in the vein keep blood moving forward toward the heart. With varicose veins, \nthe valves do not function properly, allowing blood to remain in the vein. Pooling of blood in a vein \ncauses it to  enlarge.  \nCurrent treatments include measures primarily aimed at reducing venous hypertension and preventing \nprogression to chronic inflammation and ulcerations. Surgical procedures including saphenous vein \nstripping, legation of the saphenofemoral junction, and ambulatory phlebectomy are effective in the \ntreatment of varicose veins but are associated with a high complication rate and recovery time.  \nCentella asiatica (TTFCA; 30 mg twice daily for three months) reduced serum enzymes involved in \nmucopolysaccharide metabolism (betaglucuronidase, beta -N-acetylglucosaminidase and arylsulfatase) \nin patients with varicose veins causing a protecting effect on connective tissue of varicosities and \nshowing regulatory effects of the extract of Centella asiatica on met abolism in the connective tissue of \nthe vascular wall (Arpaia et al. 1990).  \nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI)  \nCVI is a common disorder that affects the veins of the legs. It is a long -term condition in which the \nveins do not send adequately the blood from  the legs  back to the heart. In people with CVI , the veins \ndo not work properly and blood pools in the legs, leading to increased pressure in the veins and \nalteration of blood flow to the legs and feet. It occurs because of partial vein blockage or blood leakage \naround one or more valves of the veins, which are damaged, or blocked from a clot (deep vein \nthrombosis).  \nRisk factors for venous insufficiency include: genetic factors, age, sex (women), obesity, pregnancy, \nworks implying prolonged sitting or stand ing.  \nSymptoms can be mild or severe and include leg heaviness and/or cramping in legs, itching, tingling, \npain (worsening when standing), dilated or unsightly veins, oedema (swelling), skin colour changes \nand rashes on the legs and ankles, superficial var icose veins, recurrent skin infections and chronic \nulcers.  \nAs CVI results from venous hypertension secondary to superficial or deep venous valvular reflux, \ntreatment modalities are aimed at reducing venous valvular reflux. Compression therapy using pumps,  \nbandaging, and/or graded compression stockings is the mainstay of treatment for CVI. Long periods of \nsitting or standing should be avoided and care has to be taken of wounds and infections, if occur. \nPharmacologic agents such as diuretics and topical ster oid creams reduce swelling and pain short term \nbut offer no long -term treatment advantage. Herbal substances may ameliorate the symptoms but \nvary in their efficacy, quality, and safety. Several randomis ed controlled trials using horse chestnut \nseed extract  containing aescin have shown short -term improvement in signs and symptoms of CVI. \nEndovascular and surgical techniques aimed at treatment of primary and secondary venous valvular \nreflux have been shown to improve venous haemodynamics promoting healing of venous ulcers and \nimproving quality of life. The newer endovascular treatments of varicose veins using laser, \nradiofrequency ablation, and chemical foam sclerotherapy show some promise.   \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 33/44 \n A) Reviews of Centella asiatica clinical studies on CVI  \nThree reviews with comments on effects of Centella asiatica on CVI have been  published. One of them \nis centred on Centella asiatica and the two others report general comments on the protecting effects of \ndifferent substances on CVI.   \nA Cochrane review to assess the effi cacy of oral or topical phlebotonics was published in 2005; studies \npublished from January 1966 to April 2005 were analy sed. Randomised, double blind, placebo -\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of Centella asiatica and other phlebotonics such as \nrutosides, hidrosmine, diosmine, calcium dobesilate, chromocarbe, disodium flavodate, French \nmaritime pine bark extract, grape seed extract and aminaftone in CVI patients at any stage of the \ndisease were collected. The effects of treatment were estimated by relative risk or by standardised mean differences (SMD) by applying a random effects statistical model. Sensitivity analyses were also \nperformed. Fifty -nine RCTs of oral phlebotonics were included, but only 44 trials involving 4413 \nparticipants contai ned quantifiable data for the efficacy analysis: 23 of rutosides, ten of hidrosmine and \ndiosmine, six of calcium dobesilate, two of Centella asiatica , one of French maritime pine bark extract, \none of aminaftone and one of grape seed extract. Outcomes inclu ded oedema, venous ulcers, trophic \ndisorders, subjective symptoms (pain, cramps, restless legs, itching, heaviness, swelling and \nparaesthesias), global assessment measures and side effects. The authors concluded that there was \nnot enough evidence to global ly support the efficacy of phlebotonics for CVI . There is a suggestion of \nsome efficacy of phlebotonics on oedema but this is of uncertain clinical relevance. Due to the \nlimitations of current evidence, there is a need for further randomised, controlled clinical trials with \ngreater attention paid to methodological quality. Centella asiatica effects were assessed in two studies. \nOne study showed non- significant results compared with placebo in the dichotomous variable \nheaviness. The other study showed favour able results for Centella asiatica in the dichotomous variable \nglobal assessment by the patient ( Martinez et al.  2005) . \nA more recent review has been focused on CVI and in particular on drugs that have been evaluated by randomised prospective controlled trials. Horse chestnut seed extracts, flavon oids, red vine leaves \nextracts, TTFCA, procianidins, calcium dobesilate, and pentoxifylline are discussed together with the \nmicrocirculatory effects of compression therapy using bandages or stockings. The review comments \nthat the major microcirculatory eff ects that have been shown are the reduction of capillary filtration \nrate and improvements in levels of transcutaneous partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide \n(TcPO\n2 and TcPCO 2). Data suggest that a combination of pharmacologic and compression therap y may \nhave some additive effects. The review analyses two controlled studies carried out on the efficacy of \nTTFCA. The author underlines that data support TTFCA having a favourable effect on cutaneous microcirculation improving capillary filtration rate, a nkle circumference, and ankle oedema decreased, \nwith the higher dosage (120 mg per day) being more effective ( Wollina et al. 2006) . \nB) Clinical studies on the effects on CVI  \nTTFCA  \nSix studies assessing the efficacy of TTFCA in CVI patients at any stage of  the disease have been \nconsidered. Five studies were randomised and results compared with. The endpoints investigated \nwere: filtration rate, PO2, PCO2, resting flux, permeability, oedema, ankle swelling, and subjective \nsymptoms. These studies show that TTF CA ameliorated the endpoints investigated and where different \ndoses were used dose- relation improving effects were showed. The doses used were ranging between \n60 and 180 mg/day generally divided in two or three times. The total number of patients treated i n the \nsix studies was 357. The period of treatment was between 2 and 8 weeks; the median period of treatment in the six studies was about 6 weeks; the median period of treatment calculated for patient was 7.14 weeks (Table 3 ).   \nAssessment report on  Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009   Page 34/44 \n TECA  \nA multicenter, randomis ed, double- blind versus placebo study  was conducted to investigate on the \neffects of the TECA in the treatment of venous insufficiency. Ninety -four patients suffering from venous \ninsufficiency of the lower limbs were recruited and divided in three groups t reated with TECA \n120  mg/day, TECA 60 mg/day, or placebo, respectively. The treatment period was two months. A \nsignificant difference (p less than 0.05) in favour of TECA was shown for the symptoms of heaviness in \nthe lower limbs and oedema, as well as for  the overall evaluation by the patient.

Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/291177/2009   Page 37/44 \n Incandela et al. published in 2001 a review on the effects TTFCA in improving venous wall alterations \nin chronic venou s hypertension and in protecting the venous endothelium . The authors \nconcluded that TTFCA is active on the microcirculation in venous and diabetic microangiopathy and that \nsigns and symptoms of venous hypertension and oedema are also improved by treatment.  The \nremodelling on collagen synthesis is mentioned as one of the possible mechanisms of actions of TTFCA in the remodelling of echolucent (soft; therefore, with risk of thrombosis and embolisation) plaques at \nthe carotid and femoral bifurcation. TTFCA was  considered safe and well tolerated ( Incand ela et al. \n2001a; Incandela 2001b ) . \nC) Clinical studies on atherosclerosis other indications  \nTTFCA  \nAtherosclerosis is a condition in which fatty material collects along the walls of arteries. This fatty \nmaterial thickens, hardens, and may eventually bloc k the arteries.  Atherosclerosis is a type of \narteriosclerosis. The two terms are often used to mean the same thing.  \nA study was designed to evaluate whether TTFCA was effective, by modulating collagen production, in \na period of 12 months, increasing the ec hogenicity of echolucent plaques at the femoral bifurcation in \npatients with atherosclerosis. In hypoechoic atherosclerotic plaques stromal composition is limited as \nthe collagen component is generally very low; the plaque composition is mainly due to lipid \naccumulation or thrombosis. Echogenicity of hyperechoic plaques and how it could be modified by drug \nacting on the modulation of collagen synthesis was evaluated. Antiplatelet agents were used in all patients; cholesterol- lowering agents were used in 34% of patients in the treatment group and in 36% \nin the placebo group. TTFCA was used at the dose of 60 mg three times daily (oral tablets). 60  subjects were recruited: 26 completed the study in the treatment group and 24 in the placebo \ngroup. No significan t changes were observed in controls while a qualitative increase in homogeneity \nwas observed in the TTFCA group. Plaque size measured at the beginning and at the end of the study showed a median increase in size, in controls (23%; range 0 -44%); it was unch anged in the TTFCA \ngroup (variation 7%; 4 -26%). In conclusion in the treatment group plaques increased in echogenicity \nand in homogeneity; size and stenosis remained unchanged. For the authors these observations indicate a positive action of TTFCA on the s tabilis ation of hypoecho ic, low -density femoral plaques  \n(Incandela et al. 2001c ). \nFifty patients with diabetic microangiopathy  were studied by laser Doppler flowmetry (measuring \nskin blood flow at rest) (RF) and the venoarteriolar response (VAR), by transcutaneous PO\n2 and PCO 2 \nmeasurements, and by  capillary permeability evaluation (rate of ankle swelling [RAS]). Thirty of these \npatients were treated for 6 months with TTFCA (60 mg twice daily). A control group of ten patients was \ntreated with placebo and another group of ten patients was left withou t treatment thus acting as a \nsecond control group. After six months there were no significant changes in the two control groups. \nThere was a significant improvement of microcirculatory parameter in patients treated with TTFCA. RF \n(abnormally increased at t he beginning of the treatment) decreased, and the VAR (impaired at the \nbeginning of the study) improved. PO 2 increased and PCO 2 decreased the abnormally increased \ncapillary permeability was also improved (decreased). Data showed that TTFCA was useful in di abetic \nmicroangiopathy by improving microcirculation and decreasing capillary permeability and protects \nagainst the deterioration of microcirculation due to diabetic microangiopathy (Cesarone et al.  2001) . \nMADECASSOL\u00ae (corresponding to TECA or TTFCA)  \nThe e ffects of impregnated dressing of Madecassol\u00ae on ulcer cicatrisation and burns recovery were \ninvestigated. Mad\u00e9cassol\u00ae individual gauze (10xl0cm) impregnated with a mixture of TECA was used.  \nThe study was conducted on 76 patients (43 males, 33 females) who  had experienced previous allergic  \n \nAssessment report on Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/291177/2009   Page 38/44 \n dermatitis or were affected by dermatosis of different kinds.  The results are favourable after a \ntreatment period of 8- 10 days (Basset 1978) .  \nGotu kola extract  \nCentella  is used in Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of anxiety. A double -blind, placebo -controlled \nstudy was undertaken to evaluate the anxiolytic activity of Gotu Kola ( Centella asiatica ). The authors \nevaluated the effects of Gotu Kola on the acoustic startle response (ASR) in humans. The ASR model is \nbased o n the universally occurring startle reaction to unexpected stimuli (e.g., loud acoustic signals) \ncharacteri sed in humans by a sequence of physical responses, including an eye blink. The ASR is \naugmented by fear and anxiety and potentiated by anxiogenic substances. The ASR paradigm has been extensively used to investigate stress -related disorders and anxiety in humans. Subjects were \nrandomly assigned to receive either a single 12 g orally administered dose of Gotu Kola (N = 20) or \nplacebo (N = 20). Gotu Kola  was administered as crude powder herb blended with grape juice and \ncelery salt in order to make verum  and placebo solutions identical in colour, smell and taste. The \nresults revealed that compared with placebo, Gotu Kola significantly attenuated the peak ASR \namplitude 30 and 60 minutes after treatment. The authors concluded that these preliminary findings \nsuggest that Gotu Kola has anxiolytic activity in humans but it remains to be seen whether this herb \nhas therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of anxiety  syndromes (Bradwejn et al.  2000).  \nA randomi sed, placebo -controlled,  double- blind study investigated the effect of Centella asiatica on \ncognitive function of twenty -eight healthy elderly volunteers.  Participants received the plant extract at \nvarious doses ranging 250, 500 and 750 mg once daily for 2 months. A -day capsule contained a \nspeciali sed aerial part  extract containing total phenolic content equivalent to tannic  acid = 29.9 mg/g. \nIn addition, the extract also contained asiaticoside  and asiatic acid we re presented at concentration of \n1.09 and 48.89 mg/g of crude extract, respectively.  Cognitive performance was assessed using the \ncomputeri sed test battery and event -related potential whereas mood was assessed  using Bond \u2013Lader \nvisual analogue scales prior to the trial and after single, 1 and 2 months after treatment.  The results \nshowed that the high dose of the plant extract enhanced working memory and increased N100 \ncomponent amplitude of  event -related potential. Improvements of self -rated mood were also f ound \nfollowing the Centella asiatica treatment.  The present findings suggest the potential of Centella asiatica \nto attenuate the age -related decline in cognitive function and  mood disorder in the healthy elderly \n(Wattanathorn et al. 2008) . \nD) Clinical stud y on psoriasis  \nThe effects of a topical application of a cream containing the water and oil extract from Centella \nasiatica  were investigated in seven patients affected by psoriasis in a not controlled study . Lesions \ncompletely cleared in five of them, maj ority of lesions disappeared in one patient, partial but definitive \nimprovement was observed in one case. Preparation: the leaves of the plant were dried and powdered. Dry powder (100 g) was put in a flask containing 500 ml of water. Duration of treatment was from 3 to 8 weeks. Patients received no other systemic therapies. There was no evidence of systemic or local toxicity. Non e of the patient experienced any side effect (Natarajan & Paily 1973).  \nAssessor\u2019s comment: It is a not controlled study carried ou t with a very small number of patients.  \nE) Clinical studies with combined products containing Centella asiatica  \nCombined product with Alpha tocopherol, Rutin, Melilotus and Centella asiatica  (TTFCA)  \nThe combination of alpha tocopherol, rutin, Melilotus  and Centella asiatica (TTFCA) in the treatment of \npatients with CVI  was investigated. Thirty patients with CVI  have been randomi sed in two groups of  \n \nAssessment report on Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/291177/2009   Page 39/44 \n fifteen subjects (control and treatment group). The therapeutic efficacy and the clinical tolerability \nhave been valued with clinical- instrumental evaluations and by a control after 15 and 30 days. \nFunctional complaints , cramps and the oedema have been e valuated in function , presence and severity \nwith a clinical- score between 0 and 4. At the end of the observation  period, a significant improvement \nof the clinical symptoms was obtained, characterised by a diminution of the supra fascial oedema \n(Cataldi et al. 2001) . \nCombined alcoholic extract from  Centella asiatica and Punica granatum   \nTwo clinical studies on the effects of combined extracts from Centella asia tica and Punica  granatum  on \nperiodontitis were published. The total number of recruited adult patients was 35. Patients with initial \npocket depth 5- 8mm were enrolled into the studies. A herbal medication in the form of biodegradable \nchips for subgingival a pplication was used. Centella asiatica L. dried whole plants were ground and \nrefluxed three times for three hours, each with 95% ethanol. The combined alcoholic extracts were subsequently dried under vacuum. Centella asiatica dry extract has been analysed for the molecular \nstructure of asiatic acid and madecassic acid by NMR and gas- spectrophotometry. Punica granatum L. \ndried fruit peels were ground and extracted using the same method as for Centella . Unmedicated chips \nwere used in the placebo group. Probin g pocket depth, attachment level, bleeding on probing, gingival \nindex, and plaque index were recorded at baseline, 3 and 6 months. The results showed significant \nimprovements of pocket depth and attachment level in the test sites when compared with the pla cebo \nsites at 3 months and with the placebo and control sites at 6 months. All treatment sites exhibited a \nsimilar trend of decreasing plaque score. However, the test sites seemed to show slightly better \npercentage of bleeding on probing. The results indic ate that local application of  Centella asiatica and  \nPunica  granatum extracts plus scaling and root planing significantly reduced the c linical signs of chronic \nperiodontitis. In one of the two studies it was also shown that the combined extracts reduced IL -1 beta \nand IL -6 levels (Sastravaha et al.  2003; 2005) .\n \nOintment containing Mahonia aquifolium , Viola tricolor  and Centella asiatica  \nA randomis ed, double- blind, vehicle -controlled, half -side comparison with a herbal ointment containing \nMahonia aquifolium , Viola tricolor  and Centella asiatica for the treatment of mild -to-moderate atopic \ndermatitis was performed A total of 88 patients with mild -to-moderate atopic dermatitis were enrolled \nin the study. Patients between 18 and 65 years of age were treated for 4 weeks with the ointment. The primary endpoint was a summary score for erythema, edema/papulation, oozing/crust, excoriation and \nlichenification according to a 4 -point scale. Secondary efficacy variables were assessment of pruritus \nseverity (10 cm VAS) and a global assessment of effectiveness as well as tolerability. The study \nointment reduced the primary and secondary endpoints slightly more than the base cream which was \nused as vehicle; the differences were not statistically significant. Since the climatic  conditions during \nthe study duration varied from very mild and sunny to very cold and dry, a post- hoc subanalysis was \nperformed with a subset of 64 patients whose treatment was at a mean outside temperature of 10\u00b0 C \nor less. Under these conditions the pri mary endpoint showed high statistical significance. Author\u2019s \nconclusion: the ointment containing Mahonia aquifolium , Viola tricolor and Centella asiatica could not \nbe proven to be superior to a base cream for patients with mild- to-moderate atopic dermatiti s. \nHowever, a subanalysis indicated that the cream might be effective under conditions of cold and dry \nweather ( Kl\u00f6vekorn et al. 2007) . \nF) Cosmetic studies on skin ageing  \nA randomi sed double- blind study was carried out on photoaged skin of 20 female volunteers with \nactinically aged facial, ne ck and forearm skin to investigate the effects of topically applied 5% \nvitamin   C and 0.1% madecassoside on the clinical, biophysical and structural skin properties. A  \n \nAssessment report on Centell a asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/291177/2009   Page 40/44 \n fingertip unit of the tested cream was applied twice daily for 6 months to the face, as well as the \nassigned half of the neck and upper chest, and one of the arms of each volunteer whereas the other \nhalf of the neck and the other arm received the control cream. After the treatment, a significant improvement of the clinical score for deep and superficial wrinkles, suppleness, firmness, roughness \nand skin hydration has been observed. These results were corroborated by measurements of skin \nelasticity and semi- quantitative histological assessment of the elastic fibre network in the papillary \ndermi s. Two -thirds of the subjects showed an improvement and re- appearance of a normally \nstructured elastic fibre network was observed. The results indicated a functional and structural \nremodelling of chronically sun -damaged skin (Haftek et al.  2008) . \nA study w as designed with the aim to evaluate the efficacy of wrinkle improving lipstick containing \nasiaticoside (0.2% concentration).  The digital photograph image of lips before and after lipstick \napplication was assessed from 20 female volunteers. Colour tone and  time-related pigment spread was \ncalculated. The efficacy of wrinkle improving lipstick containing asiaticoside was evaluated by using \nsubjective and objective methods including image analysis in a double -blind placebo -controlled fashion. \nResults: The colo ur tone and spread phenomenon after lipstick make- up were remarkably affected by \nlip wrinkles. By using the lipstick containing asiaticoside for 8 weeks, the change of visual grading scores and replica analysis indicated the wrinkle -improving effect. As th e depth and number of wrinkles \nwere reduced, the lipstick make- up appearance by image analysis also improved significantly (Ryu et \nal. 2005) . \nA total of 30 healthy women with signs of skin ageing were studied. Fifteen of the women were treated with a food supplement based on polysaccharides derived from the fish cartilage and a natural mix of \nantioxidants ( Gingko biloba , flavonoids, Centella asiatica ) for 2 months and the other 15 with a \nplacebo. Clinical evaluation and biophysical parameters related to skin function and wrinkle severity, \nsuch as silicone replica, skin thickness, mechanical properties, skin colour and capacitance, were \nmeasured. The results showed statistically significant changes in the active -treated group in \ncomparison to the placebo. In particular, dermal thickness (treatment: from 1.13 to 1.23 mm;  \nP < 0.001), skin wrinkling (treatment: from 9.5 to 3.5 Ra; P< 0.002), skin colour (treatment: brighter and less pigmented; P < 0.02) and viscoelasticity (treatment: from 0.70 to 0.97%; P < 0.02) showed \nconsiderable improvement (Distante et al.  2002) . \nProphylaxys with an antistriae cream ( Centella asiatica extract, \u03b1~tocopherol, and collagen -elastin \nhydrolisates) was assessed by a double blind trial in 80 pregnant women. In the placebo group \n22  women (56%) presented striae, whereas in the treated group only 14 women (34%)  developed \nstriae in this pregnancy; this dif ference was significant ( p < 0.05; \u03c7\n2 test). An arbitrary score was \ndesigned to assess the intensity of striae (from 0 to 3); this score was l.42 (s.d. 0.5) in the treated group and 2.13 (s.d. 1.32) in the placebo group and this difference was also signifi cant (p = 0.014; \nMann- Whitney test). In women with a history of striae during puberty, the active cream induced a \nsignificant absolute prevention in 59% of the cases whereas in the placebo group all the women \ndeveloped striae (p = 0.00014;  \u03c7\n2 test) (Mallol  et al. 1991) . \n4.2.3.  Clinical studies in special populations (e.g. elderly and children)  \nAccording to Siddha literature, Centella asiatica  leaves are used in the treatment of syphilis, all types \nof fever, children\u2019s abdominal disorder (Sathya & Uthaya Ganga 2007), but no information on clinical \nstudies in special populations is available.  \n4.3.  Overall conclusions on clinical pharmacology and efficacy  \nClinical efficacy of TTFCA and TECA (corresponding to the same type of Centella asiatica extract) in the \ntreatment of C VI was show n in different clinical studies. Improvement of microcirculation and leg  \n \nAssessment report on Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/291177/2009   Page 41/44 \n volume associated with reduction of oedema and symptoms were observed. Three studies showed \ndose-dependent  ameliorating effects. The safety profile of Centella asiatica ext racts appears as \nacceptable and well tolerated as it is emerging from clinical studies in patients affected by CVI  and \nfrom its use from products on the market. No drug -related serious adverse events were reported \nduring the clinical trials.  \nPharmacokineti cs \nNo information is available on Centella asiatica  extracts.  \nIn a randomis ed cross- over study involving 12 test subjects, Grimaldi investigated the absorption \nbehaviour of TTFCA following both single and repeated oral doses (30 and 60 mg). The results suggest \nthat active ingredients in TTFCA are well absorbed in human volunteers (Grimaldi et al.  1990). After \nsingle oral administration of the extract, maximum plasma levels of asiatic acid were reached at  4.5 \nand 4.2 hours, with 30 and 60 mg, respectively. P lasma half -lives were 2.2 hours in the 30 mg dose \nand 3.4 hours in the 60  mg dose. No detectable saponin was present 24 hours after single dosing. \nAfter repeated doses (7- day treatment) higher peak plasma concentrations, longer half -lives, and \ngreater area -under -the curve  values were observed.  \nMadecassic acid crosses the skin rapidly but only to a limited extent. The plasma concentration did not \nexceed 0.02 to 0.05%  of the initial applied concentration. Madecassoside is at the skin application site \nonly 0. 04% of the applied dose at 1 hour and about 0.06%  after 24 hours. For asiatic acid similar \nresults were observed. In man, active ingredients of Centella asiatica are excreted principally by faeces \nin a 24 -76 hour period; smaller quantities are eliminated t hrough the kidneys (EMEA 1998) . \nNeither a possible pharmacokinetic difference between aqueous and alcoholic extracts, nor differences \nbetween the forms of application have been investigated (Brinkhaus et al.  2000) . \nNo pharmacokinetic interactions with othe r medicinal products are known.  \n5.  Clinical Safety/Pharmacovigilance  \n5.1.  Overview of toxicological/safety data from clinical trials in humans  \nAlthough a putative causal effect of adjunctive substances has also been discussed, a sensiti sing effect \nof the triterpen e fraction has been confirmed in animal experiments (Hausen 1993). In a large- scale \ncase study observation, occasional burning pain following i.m. injections and the local application of a \npowder has been reported (Wolfram 1965). Following oral administrat ion of Centella  preparations, \ngastric complaints and nausea have occasionally been reported, but were not significant versus \nplacebo (Brinkhaus et al.  2000).  \n \nThe tolerability of oral Centella asiatica preparations has generally been reported to be good i n all the \nstudies cited.  \n5.2.  Patient exposure  \nSee section 4.2.2.  \n5.3.  Adverse events and serious adverse events and deaths  \nAllergic contact dermatitis  has been reported after the topical application  of various creams and \nointments containing Centella  extracts (Rot blatt & Ziment 2001). However, further testing revealed  \n \nAssessment report on Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, h erba   \nEMA/HMPC/291177/2009   Page 42/44 \n that reactions may be due to other ingredients in the preparations (Hausen BM. Centella asiatica \nIndian pennywort), an effective therapeutic but a weak sensiti ser (Rotblatt & Ziment 2001).  \nFollowing oral administration of Centella  preparations, gastric complaints and nausea have occasionally \nbeen reported, but they were not significant versus placebo (Kartnig and Hoffmann -Bohm, 1992). Pain \nand burning sensation, following intramuscular injection or the  topical application of preparations \navailable as powders, and allergic contact dermatitis have been reported (Allegra et al.  1981; \nMarastoni et al. 1982; Pointel et al.  1987).  \nAdverse reaction from Greece: During the oral use rarely mild gastrointestinal pain (nausea, vomit \netc.) Gotu Kola has been reported to cause hyperglycaemia  and hypercholesterolemia in a single trial \nfrom 1969 (Rotblatt & Ziment 2001) . \nThree women (61, 52 and 49 years old) developed jaundice after taking Centella asiatica for 30, 20 \nand 60 days. Respective laboratory tests: ALT: 1193, 1694 and 324 U/L; ALP: 503, 472 and 484 U/L; bilirubin: 4.23, 19.89 and 3.9 mg/dl. The first patient also had ASMA (Anti -Smooth Muscle Antibody) \n1/160 and AMA (Antimitochondrial Antibody) 1/32 0. The respective pathological diagnoses were: \ngranulomatous hepatitis with marked necrosis and apoptosis; chronic hepatitis with cirrhotic transformation and intense necroinflammatory activity, and granulomatous hepatitis. All the three \npatients improved with Centella asiatica discontinuation, and ursodeoxycholic acid 10 mg/kg/day. The \nfirst patient took Centella asiatica again, with recurrence of the damage. The second one had taken \nthis herb a year before.  \nIt was  hypothesi sed that terpenic active principles of Centella  can produce hepatic injury by promoting \napoptosis and altering cell membranes. The presence of autoantibodies and granulomas also favours \nan immune -mediated mechanism (Jorge & Jorge 2005).  \nNo drug interactions have been reported.  \nCaution sh ould be advised in patients who are already taking substances having sedative properties \nwith the aim to avoid additive effect.  \nContraindications: allergy to plants of the Apiaceae  family (WHO monograph s, 1999).  \n5.4.  Laboratory findings  \nChronic treatment with TTFCA extract 30 mg twice daily for three months, reduced in humans serum \nenzymes involved in mucopolysaccharide metabolism in patients with varicose veins. TTFCA at oral doses ranging between 60 and 180 mg/day for a period of treatment between 2 and 8 weeks improves filtration rate, PO\n2, PCO 2, resting flux, permeability in CVI patients.  \nThe effects of Gotu Kola on the ASR were studied in humans. The ASR model is based on the universally occurring startle reaction to unexpected stimuli (e.g. loud acoustic signals) characteri sed in \nhumans by a sequence of physical responses, including an eye blink. The ASR is augmented by fear \nand anxiety and potentiated by anxiogenic substances. The ASR paradigm has been extensively used \nto investigate stress -related disord ers and anxiety in humans. Subjects were randomly assigned to \nreceive either a single 12 g orally administered dose of Gotu Kola (N = 20) or placebo (N = 20). Gotu \nKola was administered as crude powder herb diluted in grape juice and added with celery salt . Gotu \nKola significantly attenuated the peak ASR amplitude 30 and 60 minutes after treatment. The authors concluded that these preliminary findings suggest that Gotu Kola has anxiolytic activity in humans (Bradwejn et al. 2000).   \n \nAssessment report on Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/291177/2009   Page 43/44 \n 5.5.  Safety in special populations and situations  \nDrug interactions  \nNone reported.  \nUse in pregnancy and lactation  \nCentella asiatica is reputed to be abortifacient and to modify the menstrual cycle (Barnes et al.  2007). \nGotu Kola should be avoided during pregnancy, due to its emmenagogue action (Alternative Medicine \nReview 2007).  \nNot be used during pregnancy without medical advice (ESCOP 2009).  \nDrug abuse, withdrawal and rebound  \nNone reported.  \nEffects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability  \nNo data.  \nCont raindications  \nHypersensitivity to plants of Apiaceae  family (ESCOP 2009).  \n5.6.  Overall conclusions on clinical safety  \nThe tolerability of oral Centella asiatica preparations has generally been reported to be good in all the \nstudies cited.  \nOccasional burning pain following i.m. injections and the local application of a powder has been \nreported. Following oral administration of Centella preparations, gastric complaints and nausea have \noccasionally been reported.  \n6.  Overall conclusions  \nMedicinal products containing Centella asiatica (L.) Urban refined extracts, corresponding to TECA, are authorised and have been marketed in Europe in several Members States: Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain and the time elapsed since the first marketing authorisation  is longer than \n30  years.  \nThe medicinal use of TECA for a period of 30 years has been established on the basis of published \nliterature and decisions taken by National Competent Authorities to grant marketing authorisations.  \nThere are several clinical st udies on the efficacy of TECA extract in CVI . They involve small numbers of \npatients, but they are all positive and no negative results are reported. Moreover the period of long \nstanding use since more than 30 years of products containing TECA extract in t he EU Community, the \npharmacological data, the plausibility of the efficacy in wound healing support the traditional use in this \nindication.  \nNo reasons of concerns relating the safety are reported and the tolerability of oral Centella asiatica \npreparations  has generally been shown to be good in all studies. No adverse events from \npharmacovigilance data are known.   \n \nAssessment report on Centella asiatica  (L.) Urban, herba    \nEMA/HMPC/291177/2009   Page 44/44 \n Based on the information on manufacturing process, the HMPC is of the opinion that TECA extract \ncannot be classified as an herbal preparation due to the manufacturing steps and composition.  \nTherefore, despite the existing data on the safety and efficacy and the historical use within the Community of products containing TECA extract, it is not possible to propose any monograph for this  \npreparation, because all the data do not refer to a herbal preparation.  \nOther products containing preparations from Centella asiatica are also available in several EU Countries \nwith medicinal claims related to the microcirculation and the tissue draining. The traditiona l use of \nsome of these Centella asiatica preparations may date back to more than the 30 years required by \nDirective 2004/24/EC.  \nAlthough some data are available on other herbal preparations, these data were not found sufficient \nand consistent according to requirements of Article 16a(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC. Should such \ninformation be provided, a monograph could be prepared.  \nFurther investigation on products on the market and their use is needed, because all available information are insufficient to draft a monograph for the traditional used based on:  \n\u2212 the description  of the herbal preparation  \n\u2212 the period of use in the proposed indication in and outside Europe  \n\u2212 the posology and route of administration  \nAnnex  \nList of references  ", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
