Everyone who is eligible should get a booster shot as soon as they can to protect themselves.\u201d\nThe CDC\u2019s recommendations now allow for mixing a of booster shots, meaning eligible recipients can choose a different type of vaccine than their original series as a booster. If you are considering getting a booster that is a different vaccine type than your first series, consult your health care provider to determine what is right for you.\nFree vaccine boosters are available from clinics and providers throughout Boulder County and up-to-date list of vaccine providers can be found at\n[boco.org/CovidVaccine](https://boco.org/CovidVaccine).

Las dosis de refuerzo fueron aprobadas el mes pasado para las personas elegibles que completaron la serie de la vacuna Pfizer-BioNTech.\nLos CDC recomiendan dosis de refuerzo de Moderna para personas de 65 a\u00f1os o m\u00e1s, residentes en centros de asistencia a largo plazo, personas de 18 a 64 a\u00f1os con ciertas afecciones m\u00e9dicas subyacentes, personas de 18 a 64 a\u00f1os que tienen un mayor riesgo de contraer o transmitir COVID-19 debido a su trabajo o al lugar donde viven.\nSe recomienda un refuerzo de la vacuna Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 para cualquier persona de 18 a\u00f1os o m\u00e1s que haya sido vacunada hace dos o m\u00e1s meses.\nCualquier persona que originalmente recibi\u00f3 la vacuna de Moderna y es elegible puede recibir una dosis de refuerzo seis meses o m\u00e1s despu\u00e9s de recibir su segunda dosis de vacuna.\n\"A medida que los casos de la altamente contagiosa variante Delta contin\u00faan aumentando, obtener una dosis de refuerzo es esencial para mantenerse a salvo de COVID-19\", dijo Keith Rawls, Coordinador del Programa de Inmunizaci\u00f3n de Salud P\u00fablica del Condado de Boulder. \"Con el clima invernal m\u00e1s fr\u00edo en camino y la temporada navide\u00f1a a la vuelta de la esquina, todos pasaremos m\u00e1s tiempo en interiores y m\u00e1s cerca de los dem\u00e1s. Todos los que son elegibles deben recibir una vacuna de refuerzo tan pronto como puedan para protegerse\".\nLas recomendaciones de los CDC ahora permiten mezclar las vacunas de refuerzo, lo que significa que las personas pueden elegir un tipo diferente de vacuna como refuerzo a la de su serie original. Si est\u00e1 considerando recibir un refuerzo que es un tipo de vacuna diferente a su primera serie, consulte a su proveedor de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica para determinar lo adecuado para usted.\nLos refuerzos de vacunas son gratuitos y est\u00e1n disponibles en cl\u00ednicas y proveedores en todo el Condado de Boulder.
