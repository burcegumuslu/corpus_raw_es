La autorizaci\u00f3n de refuerzo de Pfizer-BioNTech solo se aplica a los miembros de la comunidad elegibles que recibieron la vacuna Pfizer como su serie principal.\nCon el aumento significativo de casos de COVID-19, particularmente la variante Delta, se ha demostrado que una inyecci\u00f3n de refuerzo contin\u00faa y mejora significativamente la protecci\u00f3n contra enfermedades graves.\nLa vacuna de refuerzo es gratuita y las personas no necesitan presentar una identificaci\u00f3n, seguro ni prueba de historial m\u00e9dico para recibirla. Las personas pueden autoinformar que son elegibles y recibir una vacuna de refuerzo dondequiera que se ofrezcan las vacunas de Pfizer.\nLas personas en los grupos de edad recomendados que recibieron la vacuna Moderna o J&J/Janssen probablemente necesitar\u00e1n una vacuna de refuerzo. Se esperan m\u00e1s datos sobre la efectividad y seguridad de estas vacunas de refuerzo en las pr\u00f3ximas semanas.\n\u00bfQui\u00e9n es elegible para una inyecci\u00f3n de refuerzo en este momento?\n- Las personas mayores de 65 a\u00f1os y los residentes en entornos de atenci\u00f3n a largo plazo deben recibir una inyecci\u00f3n de refuerzo de la vacuna COVID-19 de Pfizer-BioNTech al menos seis meses despu\u00e9s de su serie primaria de Pfizer.\n- Las personas de 50 a 64 a\u00f1os con ciertas afecciones m\u00e9dicas subyacentes deben recibir una inyecci\u00f3n de refuerzo de la vacuna COVID-19 de Pfizer-BioNTech al menos seis meses despu\u00e9s de su serie primaria de Pfizer.\n- Las personas de 18 a 49 a\u00f1os que tienen un alto riesgo de contraer COVID-19 grave debido a ciertas afecciones m\u00e9dicas subyacentes pueden recibir una inyecci\u00f3n de refuerzo de la vacuna COVID-19 de Pfizer-BioNTech al menos 6 meses despu\u00e9s de su serie primaria de Pfizer, seg\u00fan sus beneficios y riesgos individuales.\n- Las personas de 18 a 64 a\u00f1os con mayor riesgo de exposici\u00f3n y transmisi\u00f3n de COVID-19 debido al entorno laboral o institucional pueden recibir una inyecci\u00f3n de refuerzo de la vacuna COVID-19 de Pfizer-BioNTech al menos seis meses despu\u00e9s de su serie primaria de Pfizer, que incluye, entre otros, a maestros, trabajadores de f\u00e1bricas, trabajadores de comercio minorista, trabajadores de restaurantes, trabajadores de la salud y equipos de primera respuesta.\nComo se recomend\u00f3 anteriormente, las personas inmunodeprimidas de moderada a grave que son elegibles para una dosis adicional de una vacuna de ARNm deben recibir esa dosis al menos 28 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de completar su serie primaria.\nPara encontrar un proveedor en el Condado de Boulder, visite\n[boco.org/CovidVacunas](http://www.boco.org/CovidVacunas).
