En la Fase III los participantes reciben, o bien la vacuna experimental, o un placebo, para comprobar si la infecci\u00f3n prevalece m\u00e1s en el grupo de la vacuna experimental o en el grupo del placebo. De esta manera, se somete a prueba la eficacia de la vacuna partiendo de la hip\u00f3tesis de que se infectar\u00edan significativamente menos participantes en el grupo al cual se le aplique la misma.\nEn este tipo de ensayos, despu\u00e9s de recibir el tratamiento, los participantes regresan a sus hogares siguiendo con sus actividades diarias, con el fin de probar dicho tratamiento en condiciones reales. Esperando que un reducido grupo de participantes tenga la enfermedad, es posible que se requiera una gran cantidad de ellos y un tiempo considerable para que los ensayos revelen diferencias entre el grupo de la vacuna y el grupo del placebo.\nPhase III trials can be both complex and slow. Many people are careful in this outbreak\u2014by practicing self-isolation, for example\u2014so it may take a very long time and a large number of subjects for a Phase 3 trial to produce statistically significant results.\nGiven the unprecedented urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulators and researchers are likely to try somewhat unconventional methods to speed up this process, whether or not challenge trials are utilized. For example, Phase 3 trials may be conducted in high-risk populations\u2014people more likely to be exposed to COVID-19, such as healthcare workers\u2014to increase the ability to detect effectiveness in a smaller pool of subjects. In some cases, the Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials may be combined so the process moves more quickly.\nHuman challenge trials\nIf coronavirus human challenge trials (HCTs) are held, willing participants would receive the vaccine candidate and, once the vaccines takes effect, be deliberately exposed to live coronavirus. The ability to observe participants closely and gather samples while tracing the progress of infection in real time, knowing exactly when they were infected and with what dose, and being able to follow up over a long period, would offer an unprecedented level of scientific and medical insight into an unfamiliar virus. HCTs can complement Phase III trials in four specific ways:\nStudying COVID-19 Pathogenesis\nHCTs would allow scientists to closely observe the early stages of COVID-19 pathogenesis and people\u2019s immune response. Better understanding the natural development of COVID-19 may have a broad array of applications for the creation of vaccines and treatments.\nLearning About Antibodies\nBy re-exposing seropositive volunteers to the coronavirus, scientists can learn more about the extent to which antibodies confer immunity. This information can inform current CDC guidelines on the subject.\nCorrelates of Protection\nHCTs can help scientists learn about correlates of protection, the biomarkers of immunity to COVID-19. By closely studying people\u2019s immune response to COVID-19 in an HCT, correlates of protection can be determined and then looked for in Phase III trials. Previous vaccines, such as\n[ hepatitis B](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd2307) and [ H5N1 influenza](https://www.fda.gov/media/135020/download), have been licensed on the basis of producing known correlates of protection.\nSecond Generation Vaccines\nSince exposure to the virus is guaranteed in HCTs, it may be possible to judge a vaccine candidate\u2019s efficacy more quickly and with far fewer participants than a standard Phase III trial. By providing a more rapid signal of efficacy, HCTs could enable earlier decisions about which vaccine candidates to start manufacturing at scale. Meanwhile, by ruling out less effective or more problematic candidates earlier, we avoid unnecessarily subjecting additional tens of thousands of volunteers to the risk of any unanticipated side effects - something we want to minimize wherever possible.\nThe first vaccine approved for use is rarely the best vaccine, and most of the early candidates will be difficult to distribute in the developing world. HCTs can play an essential role in the development of second generation vaccine candidates aiming to improve upon the first vaccines that may be licensed. Without challenge trials, researchers might not be able to recruit enough study participants to test these second generation vaccines quickly. The National Institutes of Health ACTIV Group\n[wrote](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2020076) in July that challenge trials \u201cmight be able to accelerate development of later rounds of vaccine candidates.\u201d\nHCTs will also be of particular importance if Phase III trials fail to demonstrate high vaccine efficacy due to low infection rates in the general population (for instance, due to temporary easing of the outbreak). Efficacy data from an HCT combined with safety data from a larger clinical trial could be sufficient for vaccine licensure.\nAltogether, there are scenarios in which the speed of HCTs and the precise data they provide are indispensable to the development of an effective and accessible COVID-19 vaccine, with thousands or even millions of lives spared (depending on the pandemic\u2019s long-term trajectory).\nAt the same time, there are many legitimate concerns about and objections to HCTs.
