If you agree to meet friends at three \no\u2019clock, you can bet that they will be there just after three. Since Britons are so time \nconscious, people make great effort to arrive on time. 0 __A__ (example) . If you are unable \nto keep an appointment, __1__. You should arrive at the exact time specified for dinner, \nlunch, or appoi ntments with professors, doctors, and other professionals . You should arrive \nany time during the hours specified for teas, receptions, and cocktail parties.

If you receive a written invitation to an event that says \u201cRSVP\u201d (Please, reply), you \nshould respond to let the person who sent the invitation know whether or not you plan to \nattend as soon as possible. \nAlthough it is not necessarily expected that you give a gift to your host, __4__, especially if \nyou have been invited for a meal. Flowers, chocolate, or a small gift are all appropriate; \n__5__ and is an appropriate means to express your appreciation for the invitation. \nEveryday dress is appropriate for most visits to peoples\u2019 homes. You may want to dress \nmore formally when attending a holiday dinner or cultural event, such as a concert or theatre \nperformance. When you accept a dinner invitation, tell your host if you have any dietary \nrestrictions; __6__. And remember the evening meal is the main meal of the day in most \nparts of Britain.  \nAdapted from  Wikipedia  \nA. it is often considered impolite to arrive even a few minutes late (0) (example)  \nB. a thank -you note after the visit is also considered polite  \nC. he or she will want to plan a meal that you can enjoy  \nD. it is considered polite to do so  \nE. it is expected that you call the person you are meeting  \nF. they will expect you to be there on the dot \nG. this may be achieved with extra information on the event itself \nH. you are requested to demand an apology, above all if being held up by traffic jams  \nI. you may want to remember it is always wise to telephone before visiting someone at \nhome  \n \nExample 0 A \n \n1  2  3  4  5  6  Read the following text.

Write the correct answer on the answer sheet provided. 0 is the \nexample.   \n \n \n  \n  2 \nTASK 2  (Marks: 8 ) \nHOMEOPATHY  \nHomeopathy is an extremely controversial issue. The National Health Service (NHS)  says \nthere is \u201cno good -quality evidence\u201d that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health \ncondition, yet it funds it. Why and to what extent?  \nThere are now only two NHS centres offering homeopathic treatments \u2013  in London and \nGlasgow. Another two  former ones \u2013  in Bristol and Liverpool \u2013 have been moved into the \nprivate sector, but still see NHS patients. However, the way money flows around the health \nservice makes it hard to work out exactly how much is spent across these sites. For example, \npatients receiving fertility treatment or being given support for pain or anxiety may get referred \nto these centres , but are not necessarily recorded as receiving homeopathic care.  \nNonetheless, the Good Thinking Society, which has been campaigning for the NHS to stop \nfunding homeopathy, estimates spending is in the region of \u00a35m a year.  \nThe NHS also funds homeopathic remedies through prescriptions, but that does not amount to \nmuch in monetary terms. Last year there were nearly 9,000 issued at a cost of \u00a394,000 i n \nEngland. So let us call it about \u00a35m of NHS funding for homeopathy each year. Now that \nsounds like a lot of money, but to put it into context the total amount spent on the health \nservice across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is more than \u00a3 130bn. It means \nless than 0.004% of the budget goes on homeopathy. It is a tiny fraction \u2013  a \u201cdrop in the \nocean\u201d says the association, yet enough to pay for an extra 200 nurses or 50 consultants.  \nHomeopathy is based on the concept that diluting a version of a substance that causes illness \nhas healing properties. For example, pollen or grass could be used to create a homeopathic \nhay fever remedy. One part of the substance is mixed with 99 parts of water or alcohol and this \nis repeated six times in a \u201c6c\u201d formulation or 30 times in a \u201c30c\u201d formulation. The end result is \ncombined with a lactose (sugar) tablet. Homeopaths say the more diluted  it is, the greater the \neffect. Scientific consensus says patients are getting nothing but sugar. So why does the NHS \nfund it, given it does not even seem to believe it works?  \nTo understand that, we need to go back to the start of the NHS. Homeopathy has been used \nsince the 1800s and, by the time the health service was created in 1948, there were five \nhomeopathic hospitals \u2013 the four mentioned above plus another in Kent which closed in 2009. \nUnlike now, there was not such a vociferous campaign against its use and so homeopathic \ntreatments were brought under the NHS umbrella, where they have remained ever since. But \nin 1999 a drugs advisory body called the National Institute of Health and Care (NICE) was set \nup to carefully assess the cost- effectiveness of new drugs and technologies in Britain. They \nhave looked at over 600 homeopathic treatments since, taking into account cost, how effective \nthey are and whether there are other similar treatments available. The treatments NICE rejects \nget the headlines, so it may come as a surprise to many that they have actually agreed to \nrecommend over 80% of them for NHS use.  \nSo with ever -greater emphasis on evidence -based medicine \u2013  plus the increasing strain on \nresources \u2013 a growing clamour for an end to homeopathy funding has developed. In 2010 the \nHouse of Commons\u2019 Science and Technology Committee called for NHS funding to stop as \nthere was no evidence beyond a placebo effect \u2013 when a patient feels better because of their \nbelief that the treatment works. Twenty years ago, there was close to \u00a31m a year spent on \nhomeopathic prescriptions, but the figure now is 10 times less, while NHS homeopathic \ncentres have found themselves disappearing.
