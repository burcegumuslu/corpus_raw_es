In Ghana, the total was 96 percent, and in Nigeria 93 percent.\nIn heavily urbanised South Africa the rate has dropped, from 85 percent in 2005 to 64 percent this year, the survey indicated. But in West Africa -- where wealthy, U.S.-based evangelical churches have made strong inroads -- the rate was rising.\nMEMORY OF NKRUMAH\nThese churches, with \u201chell-fire\u201d preachers, have all but eliminated the memory of secular African independence leaders of the 1960s, like Ghana\u2019s own Kwame Nkrumah who once said humanist principles defined \u201cthe African personality.\u201d\n\u201cFear created the gods, and fear preserves them,\u201d declared Nkrumah, ousted in a 1966 coup after six years in power.\nThe Ghanaian association has itself set out its own concept of what humanists -- whose worldview is based on human cooperation, reason and rationalism, and rejects belief in deities and the supernatural -- are up against.\n\u201cBelieving in the existence of a god is inculcated from childhood through family, community, church and school,\u201d it said. Questioning the truth of religion was discouraged by fear of social ostracism and other consequences.\n\u201cIt can mean difficulty finding work, developing one\u2019s business, making friends and finding romantic relationships,\u201d the association said. People who refused to go to church or mosque were often cast out by their families.\n\u201cThe common perception is that if you do not believe in the existence of a god you must either be worshipping the devil or be an immoral person, not to be trusted,\u201d it said.\nIgwe says that in large parts of the continent, the media are hostile and often pillory freethinkers, especially when they argue for the human rights of marginalised groups like gays and lesbians, also excoriated by religious and government leaders.\n\u201cSo often, people who break away from blind faith believe they are alone,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cThat is one reason why we have to organise and speak out loudly and let people know there are many others who think like them.\u201d (Reported by Robert Evans, editing by Paul Casciato)\nOur Standards:\n[The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)", "language": null, "image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/global-gateway.html", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/login.html", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216467423-Contact-Reuters", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us", "https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/swissMktRpt", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "//www.reuters.com/tools/mobile", "//newslink.reuters.com/join/subscribe", "//sales.reuters.com/en/ ", "//www.reuters.com/advertising-guidelines", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html#cookies", "//www.reuters.com/terms-of-use", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "javascript:window.OneTrust.ToggleInfoDisplay();", "https://www.reuters.com/info/disclaimer", "https://thomsonreuters.com/copyright/"]}
