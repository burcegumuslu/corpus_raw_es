BSWRI provides the critical infrastructure and operational resources needed to both safely and effectively conduct research across a broad range of specialty areas.\nBy the numbers:\n- Staffing more than 400 employees, including scientists, laboratory assistants, research nurses, clinical research assistants and research coordinators\n- Utilizing more than 200,000-square-feet of research space\n- Conducting more than 1,400 active research protocols, spanning more than 60 medical specialties\n- Serving more than 800,000 people at medical centers across our healthcare system\n- Publishing more than 500 peer reviewed publications per year\nOur patients and community members are at the heart of everything we do at BSWRI\nA key aspect of delivering high quality, patient-centered care is ensuring that our research is also truly patient-centered. From discovering new therapies that enhance available treatment options, to studying population health and other trends that improve quality of care, we are committed to bringing innovation to the forefront of healthcare by making research studies and trials more accessible to the diverse communities our system serves.\nFrequently published in major scientific journals and reported at medical and scientific meetings, our research has resulted in more than 500 issued and pending patents spanning immunotherapy, genomics, biomarkers, metabolomics, metabolic, cardiovascular disease and medical devices. BSWRI also holds robust cardiovascular, oncology and transplant research portfolios, in addition to overseeing studies across nearly 50 other specialty areas.\nLearn more about clinical research by following:\nHow you can participate in clinical research\nWe offer patients the opportunity to participate in clinical trials across a wide range of medical specialties. By taking part in a clinical trial, you can play a more active role in your own healthcare and help others by contributing to medical research. Baylor Scott & White Research Institute undertakes clinical trials in both North Texas and Central Texas.\nTo see if you qualify for enrollment in one of our clinical trials, call\n[1.844.BSW.DOCS](tel:+18442793627) (1.844.279.3627) or [search online](/research/clinical-trials).\nFrequently asked questions\n-\nWhy participate in a clinical trial?\nResearch is an important aspect in the fight against cancer. Cancer hates innovation\u2014and research IS innovation. Participation in clinical trials helps create new ideas, and it helps researchers gain new knowledge, data, and insights that can impact potential treatments and medications that could help future generations. Taking part in research can also present patients who have attempted other treatments or are looking for other options with a choice not otherwise available to the general public because the medications and therapies involved are still being evaluated.\nBut research at Baylor Scott & White is about more than just seeing how we can treat cancer.\nWe have studies that seek to find better ways to detect and prevent cancer in patients who have never had it, may have a family history of it, or are worried about their cancer coming back. We also study how cancer progresses in different individuals and under different circumstances, such as when other health conditions are involved. And we have trials that seek to find ways to improve the quality of life for people who are living with cancer or who have just completed their treatment.\nParticipation in research can help inform every aspect of a patient\u2019s cancer journey.\n-\nWhat are the potential risks?\nBecause clinical trials and other research studies are designed to evaluate a new treatment or therapy, factors such as safety, side effects and basic effectiveness are a natural part of the evaluation. As such, participants may experience an adverse response or run the risk of the treatment or therapy having no effect at all. These factors are all discussed with patients in advance of any involvement, and patients are closely monitored throughout the process to watch for any such signs.\n-\nAm I guaranteed to get a drug or would I get a placebo?\nNot all trials involve the use of a placebo. If the trial you are considering does involve placebos, a research team member will discuss this information and related details with you prior to as part of your initial screening.\n-\nWhat do I have to do to qualify?\nEvery research opportunity has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria that help determine if a person qualifies for the study. Research team members review these criteria with interested participants as part of an initial screening. Criteria can include general information like your age, as well as more detailed factors, such as the stage of cancer you have or other health conditions or procedures in your medical history.\n-\nWhat are the costs involved in a clinical trial?\nEvery trial is different, but generally participants do not have to pay for costs tied to the treatments or medications involved in the trial. These costs are generally covered by the trial\u2019s sponsor(s). The patient (or the patient\u2019s insurance provider) maintains the responsibility of covering costs related to any routine testing, procedures or medications they take as part of their existing cancer treatment.\nAs part of the trial, a BSWRI team member will review study consent forms with you and provide information about what payments you are and are not responsible for making.\nResearch participation can require more appointments, lab work, in-person visits, or even hospital stays than a participant is used to having. This is needed as part of the monitoring and study process, but may require more time investments than expected. Appointment and other study-related details will be discussed in advance with participants as part of the enrollment process.\n-\nOnce I join a trial, am I required to stay enrolled?\nNo, you can stop participating in a clinical trial at any time and for any reason. You are not required to stay enrolled under any circumstances.\n-\nWhat are the different phases of research?\nThere are different types of studies and trials involved in research. Some focus on data collection and observation, or studying tissue and tumor samples. These types of studies generally require less time from the patient after samples and related information are initially captured. Others studies involve more direct patient interaction and monitoring \u2013 these are often the studies that involve evaluation of a new drug, or combination of drugs, or a new therapy or treatment approach. Below is a breakdown of these phases as explained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA):\nPhase 1: Studies that are usually conducted with healthy volunteers and that emphasize safety. The goal is to find out what the drug's most frequent and serious adverse events are and, often, how the drug is metabolized and excreted.\nPhase 2: Studies that gather preliminary data on effectiveness (whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition). For example, participants receiving the drug may be compared with similar participants receiving a different treatment, usually an inactive substance (called a placebo) or a different drug. Safety continues to be evaluated, and short-term adverse events are studied.\nPhase 3: Studies that gather more information about safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs.\nPhase 4: Studies occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing. These including post-market requirement and commitment studies that are required of or agreed to by the sponsor. These studies gather additional information about a drug's safety, efficacy, or optimal use.\nBaylor Scott & White Research Institute currently supports research within each of the different phases and categories mentioned above.\nAreas of research\nAll of Us Research Program\nThe All of Us Research Program is a large research program. The goal is to help researchers understand more about why people get sick or stay healthy. People who join will give us information about their health, habits, and what it\u2019s like where they live. By looking at patterns, researchers may learn more about what affects people\u2019s health.
