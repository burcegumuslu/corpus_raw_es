This quirky looking Sentinel has arrived, and it serves a very clear purpose: provide new players with an introduction to the Companion System. New player experience is always on our mind as Developers. This new Sentinel joining your Arsenal has that exact new-player approach to it\u2019s functionality and mechanics. Say hello to TAXON! Perhaps Taxon will not replace the Mastery Rank 23 player's beloved Carrier, but please keep in mind that it was created and geared towards new-players who are experiencing Warframe for the first time.\n- TAXON SENTINEL\n- A new Sentinel has been discovered that is programmed to assist newly-awoken Tenno. With 'Retarget' and 'Molecular Conversion' as its default Precepts, Taxon protects its owner with shield restoration. Taxon comes equipped with the Artax Sentinel Weapon! Freeze targets in their tracks with this Sentinel mounted ice-beam.\nNewly awoken Tenno will gain this Sentinel Blueprint by completing the first Junction between Earth and Venus. If you have already completed this Junction, you will receive Taxon\u2019s Blueprint in your Inbox upon login and can be found in the Market for Credits!\n- KINTSUGI WEAPON SKIN COLLECTION (skins purchasable separately)\nRepaired with golden-alloys, these battle-scarred weapons have been transformed into objects of beauty.

Contains skins for the Braton, Paris, Kunai, Lato, Aklato, Skana and Bo.\n- The Braton, Lato, Paris, Kunai, Skana and Bo (and their MK1/Ak versions) have all received a refreshed look! These starter weapons are the first tools new player's see, yet they've been using models and textures that are almost half a decade old! We have refreshed these weapons to look much higher quality for starting weapons. Please note that all pre-existing skins for the Braton (Day of the Dead, Forest, Conclave) will appear to use the 'legacy' version of the weapon.\n- The Braton, Lato, and Paris have also received newly remastered sounds as a major change to the way weapon firing sounds work. These remastered sound changes will come in a future update for their Prime versions.\n- Note from George the Audio Director: \u201cThese 3 weapons will be the first in the game to receive this treatment. With this whole new dimension of power through the updated sounds, you will notice that there is more bass, punch, and a greater sense of heaviness to these weapons. We will be doing a full Developer Workshop soon on our new process, as we slowly roll it out to all existing bullet and arrow based weapons as well as integrate it into new weapon releases.\u201d\n- The Foundry now shows how many more uses are available per Blueprint, and if the Blueprint has unlimited uses.

By now, a majority of Tenno have been faced with a persistent and protruding infection on numerous Warframes. For those with a fully 7-day matured Helminth Cyst, the individual permanent cure awaits you in the Helminth Infirmary. The completion of Glast Gambit is not required to have your Helminth Cyst removed, and once the cure has been administered that Warframe will not be granted access back into the room and can no longer be infected.

Keep in mind that casting Virulence on Maggots cause them to detonate!\n- Nidus\u2019 Ravenous Maggots no longer auto detonate when feasting on enemies. Previously the Maggots could do a majority of the grunt work and you were able to watch the carnage and gain Stacks at the same time. Now to pop the Maggots you\u2019ll need to cast Virulence on them and rejoice in your hard earned Stack accumulation. It\u2019s also worth noting that with testing by our team, the Stack rhythm before and after this change wasn\u2019t noticed at all.\n- Improved the FX of Maggot explosion to better represent the intended area of explosion.\n- Nidus\u2019 Ravenous Maggots will still attack but no longer latch on other Infested Maggots or Kuva Jesters due to awkward animations.\n- Fixed FX, Maggots, & Health regeneration while in Ravenous staying around forever if cast by a Client who leaves.\n- Updated and improved the look of Frost\u2019s abilities with fancy new ice textures!\n- Further optimized network access to help alleviate \u2018Network Not Responding\u2019 issues.\n- Players who have reached the Riven Mod capacity can now continue to trade Riven Mods as long as the trade does not result in going over the capacity.\n- In an effort to address the issue of people not noticing the movement of The Kuva Fortress, we have made the loop completion time odd rather than a 24 hour cycle.

We are aiming to make the full drop table more broadly appealing. When The War Within launched, we added Rivens to Sorties as a common drop to be the new, interesting, and unique evergreen goal for players in Sorties. Rivens remain common with these changes as we see them as the ultimate goal for Sorties. Regarding Nitain specifically, the majority of our recently active players have less than 9 Nitain in their accounts and there is considerable interest in some new ways to acquire, so we are trying out Sorties as an option. A next step here is being considered to add a completely new Ayatan in the place of 2K Endo to give collectors and Endo hunters something to look forward to.\nSpoiler Changes:\nChanges:\n- Reduced the Cycle sound of Riven Mods.\n- Polished numerous Operator/Transference sounds.\n- Tweaked the description of the \u2018Kill X Sentients\u2019 Riven Mod to \u2018Get the killing blow on X Sentients\u2019 to reduce confusion.\n- \u2018Kill X Sentients\u2019 Riven Mod can now be completed when killed by sources other than the player's Warframe (Operator, Companion, etc).\nKuva Siphon Changes:\n- Kuva Siphon missions will spawn on any Planet near the ever-moving Kuva Fortress.\n- Kuva Siphon missions will have its own selectable mission to enter (exactly like how other multi-mission nodes work).

The following Riven changes have been made:\n- Riven Disposition (Faint, Neutral, and Strong) has been added! Riven Disposition is the way in which power level of Mods is attuned to the weapon it is generated for. You can expect to see more powerful Rivens for less used weapons and vice versa.\n- Existing Rivens have been automatically rebalanced to fit this Riven Disposition\n- When Cycling a Riven with Kuva, you can now choose to \"Accept\" or \"Decline\" a Cycle result using the arrow and Confirm button presented.\n- You will only have to Unveil a Riven Mod one time: on first discovery. Cycling no longer Veils Riven Mods. *A script has been run to unveil Veiled Riven Mods that have been Cycled. Relog required.\n- Adjusted Endo return when dissolving Riven mods:\n- +100 Endo for every Mastery Rank requirement above the minimum of 8\n- +200 Endo for every Cycle performed on the Mod\n- Chat Linked Riven Mods now contain correct challenge progress/requirement info, as well as Cycles.\n- Kuva Cycling costs have been reduced significantly.\n- Before:\n- Cycle 1: 900\n- Cycle 2: 1000\n- Cycle 3: 1300\n- Cycle 4: 1800\n- Cycle 5: 2500\n- Cycle 6: 3400\n- Cycle 7: 4500\n- Cycle 8: 5800\n- Cycle 9: 7300\n- Cycle 10: 9000\n- Continues each Cycle, no cap.\n- After:\n- Cycle 1: 900\n- Cycle 2: 1000\n- Cycle 3: 1200\n- Cycle 4: 1400\n- Cycle 5: 1700\n- Cycle 6: 2000\n- Cycle 7: 2350\n- Cycle 8: 2750\n- Cycle 9: 3200\n- Cycle 10: 3600\n- Continues each Cycle, no cap.\n- Riven Disposition stats on Rifles will be visible if there's at least one equippable Riven Mod for said Rifle.\n- Tweaked the Cycling diorama to include Samodeus and updated Riven Mod Cycle and transition sounds!\nFixes:\n- Fixed Veiled Riven Mods unequipping themselves due to not meeting the Mastery Rank requirement.\n- Fixed picking up Reactant as the Operator not counting towards your current Reactant pile.\n- Fixed the power menu remaining on the UI when using Transference and playing with a controller.\nRevisi\u00f3n 19.0.5\nNovember 18th, 2016\n[- Publicaci\u00f3n del foro](https://forums.warframe.com/topic/721283-hotfix-1905/)\nAgregados:\nYou can now replay The War Within quest!

When traditional developers pen their open letters at launch, it's often the last step after months or years of development. It's often a sign-off to address the people who are about to dive into the finished work of a collective group. But Warframe is far from traditional and our work is never done.\nThe War Within is here on PC! This is the next chapter in the story of Warframe. What we set out to do always seems a little wild in hindsight, but it's the thrill and ambition of storytelling that drives us to challenge ourselves and you. We want to grow and change Warframe in interesting ways. We're presenting you another chapter of growth today.\nThis chapter tells a story of your patience, our gratitude, and of course some wonderful evolution for the game. We're introducing an awe inspiring and dangerous environment: the Kuva Fortress. We're pushing our engine technology to bring you graphic improvements. We're bringing you a story about your past.\nThe War Within is also a reflection of lessons for us on how to feed, respect, and tame the growing animal that is Warframe. This update's name has outgrown itself and it represents something bigger. If you asked any of us 4 years ago what we expected to happen with this project, none of us would believe you if you showed us this day.\nWe are beyond lucky to have hard working people at Digital Extremes to bring this chapter of Warframe to life. We are grateful to have you to share it with.\nThank you Tenno. We hope you enjoy another Update that's free from us to you.\nDigital Extremes.Agregados:\nClaim your free Glyph with promo code WARWITHIN until Nov 18 at 2pm ET!\n[warframe.com/promocode](https://warframe.com/promocode)\n[Archivo:The War Within - Promo Code.gif](/es/wiki/Especial:SubirArchivo?wpDestFile=The_War_Within_-_Promo_Code.gif)\nThe Grineer Empire grows stronger as a cryptic adversary surfaces.

The Kuva Guardians will surround you and, with just a few well-placed blows, will bring you to your knees. Defeating them will depend on more than what\u2019s in your Arsenal...\nKUVA JESTER - Beware of these mischievous, Jester-like creatures that are quick to attack and are quite deadly.Grineer \u2018Kuva Siphon\u2018 Missions:\nAfter you complete The War Within, Kuva Siphons may appear on Hard Grineer Environments (Sedna, Kuva Fortress, Uranus). These are side-quests related to the larger goals of the Grineer Empire. You will encounter new enemies here, and be required to use the skills learned in The War Within to prevail.\nNew Weapons:\nTwin Rogga - These twin barrels of destruction are the signature pistols of the Kuva Guardians.\nKesheg - Slice through mobs of unruly enemies with this fierce halberd, the signature weapon of the Kuva Guardians.\nFourth and fifth weapons exist\u2026 but defeating The War Within will be necessary to discover them.New Cosmetics:\n- Kuva Kavat Armor - This decorative armor was forged for the Grineer Queens\u2019 royal Kavats.\n- Kuva Kubrow Armor - Drahks are outfitted with this armor for the Queens\u2019 royal prisoner hunts.\n- Landing Craft Kuva Skins - A Kuva themed skin for your Landing Craft.\n- Kuva Cloak - Once worn by an elegant Elder Queen, before time and disease left her body mangled and disfigured.\n- Kuva Braid - Symbolizing the corrupting power of the Grineer Queens.\n- Kuva Armor Collection - A full set of Kuva Armor.\n- Continuity Collection - Become Grineer royalty with this complete set of Kuva weapons and armor.\nGeneral Additions:\n- Frost & Frost Prime now have cloth physics!

You can now disable or enable more Graphics Quality options!\nEver since the change to the new Solar Chart in Specters of the Rail, the Invasion system hasn't exactly been exciting or novel. The War Within brings some much needed freshness to this part of the game!\nAs part of an effort to both repair and refresh the Invasion system, the following changes and additions have been made:\n- Prior Sortie Season Vandal and Wraith rewards can now be offered as invasion rewards by the respective faction.\n- Interception missions have been added into the mix when playing for invading faction.\n- Winning factions will now 'Occupy' the node for up to 24 hours. During this period, the invaders will raid the location for resources towards a mysterious 'Construction Project'\n- The mission type at a particular Invasion node will change every 15 minutes.\n- The progress of an invasion can now lead to a Faction Specific event! Watch closely as the Grineer and Corpus gather enough strength!\n- Factions now pay an additional 1000 Credits each time you run a mission for them on the same node (up to max of 10K).\n- Fixed issues with Invasion missions loading to black and no spawning enemies.\n- Fixed Invasion progress not counting if a player was in mission during a Hotfix.\n- Fixed Phorid occupied nodes still showing the underlying bosses.\nSorties were introduced in The Second Dream. They originally launched with 'Seasons' that rotated with set rewards. Since launch we iterated in several ways, including adding repeatable/non-repeatable rewards and more. Now we bring you more change with The War Within: Sortie Seasons are no more. We now have a set reward list of rewards that are always repeatable.\n- The new pre-requisite to access Sorties is completion of The War Within.\n- Nezha Parts have moved to the Tenno Lab in player Dojos.\n- Vandal and Wraith weapon parts have moved to the Invasion System as rewards for their respective factions.\n- Sortie Rewards are now set as:\n- Various Endo Amounts\n[Catalizador Orokin](/es/wiki/Catalizador_Orokin) [Reactor Orokin](/es/wiki/Reactor_Orokin)\n- Exilus Adapter\n- A random Focus Lens\n- Legendary Core\n- 1 new item coming soon (see below)!\n- There is a new addition to Sortie rewards, but this will be revealed upon completion of The War Within.\nInterception, Defense, Survival, and Excavation Endless Void Fissure Missions have been revamped and now function in a new way!\nFirst, every reward interval can have it's own Relic selected and opened (if you get enough Reactant per interval).\nSecondly, the reward intervals are as follows (for clarity):Defense: 5 Waves. Interception: 1 Round. Survival: 5 Minutes. Excavation: 200 Cryotic.\nShould you collect the necessary Reactant per interval and open your Relic, a bonus will occur and you will be allowed to re-select a new Relic for the next interval! The bonuses are as follows:\n- Every time you open a Relic, you get a pre-determined booster. These boosters stack the longer you stay.\n- The first interval: 1.25x Affinity.\n- The second interval: 1.25x Credits.\n- The third interval: 1.25x Resources.\n- The fourth interval: 1.25x Resource Drop Rate.\n- The fifth interval: a random Exceptional Relic (that can be used in the same mission).\n- The sixth interval: 1.5x Affinity (replaces first).\n- The seventh interval: 1.5x Credits (replaces second).\n- The eighth interval: 1.5x Resources (replaces third).\n- The ninth interval: 1.5x Resource Drop Rate (replaces fourth).\n- The tenth interval: a higher tier random Flawless Relic (that can be used in the same mission).\n- Once you get to the fifteenth interval, you'll receive a random Radiant Relic (that can be used in the same mission.\n- Boosters continue to increase every set of intervals and are capped at double (2x).\n- Radiants on every fifth interval past the fifteenth.\n- Every Relic opened will result in Traces!\nCapture enemy types are now split into 3 tiers- Easy (1-10), Medium (10-20), Hard (20+).\nCorpus Nullifiers and white-suited Corpus Targets (capable of creating a Snow Globe-esqe barrier) no longer appear on lower level Capture missions.Holster Customization Changes:\n- Changed \"X Offset\" option to adjust Holster Position to move along to edge of your Warframe.\n- Added \"Attach Part\" option to select specific areas to Holster.

Experiments (such as The Vacuum Within) typically have 2 sides- you either fail or you succeed. Our previous idea to have universal Vacuum be a 3 Mod makeup was proposed on Devstream #80, to which we then scrapped after acknowledging the copious amounts of \u201cplease don\u2019t do that\u201d feedback.\nFrom that, our new idea was to have Vacuum built into every Sentinel with a reduced range. Upon reading the constructive feedback from our Community about The Vacuum Within, it was clear we needed to make some tweaks- and here we have experimental Mutation X! Vacuum is now an equippable Mod (Precept) for all Sentinels. We have also increased the range from 6m to 12m at max rank. All current Sentinel owners will receive this Mod instantly, as well as retroactively with every Sentinel crafted or purchased- much like other default Precepts.\nWith that being said, we appreciate those that kept the feedback valuable and refrained from death threats. We changed something precious to you, and we will continue to change where needed as we listen to the Community.\n- Changed the Mod image for Ammo Case to better reflect its role.\n- Compacted large numbers for some ability notifications on the HUD (eg: Equinox\u2019s Maim).\n- Fixed the Wukong Noggle missing his tail.\n- Fixed the Gazal Chest Plate not being centered on Hydroid.\n- Fixed the Halikar doing 10 throw damage instead of the intended 105.\n- Fixed Sentinels attacking enemies while you\u2019re performing a stealth finisher.\n- Fixed Oxium Ospreys suicide charging immediately.\n- Fixed being able to place decorations in the Operator room in areas you should not be able to.\n- Fixed Ammo Case still applying its buffs after Carrier has died.\n- Fixed Ammo Case refilling ammo on respawn.\n- Fixed Ammo Case refilling ammo on Host Migration.\n- Fixed Emblems placed on the right Gazal Shoulder Guard floating away.\n- Fixed numerous translation errors.\nRevisi\u00f3n: The Vacuum Within 1\nOctober 5th, 2016\n[- Publicaci\u00f3n del foro](https://forums.warframe.com/topic/705626-the-vacuum-within-hotfix-1/)\nCorrecciones:\n- Fixed a missing Platinum price on the Djinn Deluxe Bundle (Gazal Complete Collection).\n- Fixed gifting not working for the Djinn Deluxe Bundle (Gazal Complete Collection).\n- Fixed a crash that would occur when Ammo Case would trigger on a weapon with no ammo (Exalted Blade, etc).\nActualizaci\u00f3n: The Vacuum Within\nOctober 5th, 2016\n[- Publicaci\u00f3n del foro](https://forums.warframe.com/topic/705566-the-vacuum-within%C2%A0/) - Tenno Reinforcement\nThe Vacuum Within:\n- All Sentinels now have a passive 6 meter Loot Vacuum, no Mods required!\nThis particular Update note is going to be a bit of a read, so get ready!\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming and a highly request change! If you hadn\u2019t guessed it already, Carrier usage represents almost 80% of the total used Sentinels, and considering we have more than 5 unique choices this needed balancing. Today we're eager to introduce a community driven experiment within the Sentinel class. This is not the final book in this conversation, just the beginning.\nWe've also mentioned\n[Kubrow](/es/wiki/Kubrow)/ [Kavat](/es/wiki/Kavat) are not off the table. What we want to do is measure. We know where Carrier sits in usage compared to the rest of the options. We want a calculated release of a change that will deliver on giving Sentinels the function of Vacuum, and see how it affects the usage of content in that category. The results are something we'll be sharing as it should be very interesting to everyone invested in this particular topic. The shovel in the ground on this will apply to Sentinels first, but Pets aren't off the table.\nWe're starting with Sentinels to have this contained group of content analyzed. We will be keeping a close eye on how all of you feel about the new vacuum as well as looking at metrics to see how the distribution of sentinel usage changes across the community (right now 80% of you use Carrier)! We will share results along the way as a team, as soon as this Friday on Devstream #81!\n- Carrier\u2019s precept has been automatically changed to Ammo Case - now increases ammunition capacity and converts ammo pickups into ammo for the currently equipped weapon after a short delay.\nTenno Reinforcement:\n- Gazal Machete - Each kill with this swooping blade adds bonus corrosive damage to the Djinn Sentinel\u2019s next Fatal Attraction cast. In turn, each Fatal Attraction cast by the sentinel bestows the weapon with a period of corrosive damage.\nResearch it in the Tenno Lab or find it in the Market today!Agregados:\n[Djinn Gazal Skin](/es/wiki/Centinela_(cosm%C3%A9ticos)#Adjuntos) - Wrapped in silk and etched with glowing designs, the Gazal offers a glimpse of the Djinn uncorrupted by Infestation.\nGazal Complete Collection - An entire set of Gazal armor.\n[Wukong](/es/wiki/Wukong)and [Nezha](/es/wiki/Nezha) [Noggles](/es/wiki/Orbitador#Noggles)have been added to the Market!\n- You can now place Resource decorations in your Landing Craft!

Hunt them like Indiana Jones via special missions given to you by Maroo, or find them during your regular excursions.\nThere are two new terms to familiarize yourself with: Sculptures and Stars. The individual Sculptures and Stars have several variations of rarity and value. Sculptures, which are more valuable, can be completed by socketing in the appropriate types of Stars.\nMaroo will pay handsomely in Endo for your Ayatan treasures, but she\u2019ll offer more for completed Sculptures. You\u2019ll have to decide whether you want a quick payout or wait for the big prize and complete your Sculpture. If Endo isn\u2019t what you desire most, you can keep your collection on display in your Landing Craft or trade your treasures with other Tenno.\nFinding Ayatan treasures in regular missions will be rare, but if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, you can speak with Maroo for a special weekly treasure hunt mission that will test your coordination, speed, and mobility. If you enjoy the more leisurely approach to art collecting, you can always have other Tenno do the work for you and acquire your treasure through the trade system.

With updated scaling and new combat mechanics, this airborne Corpus threat has never been so fierce! Visit this updated boss battle on the usual node on Europa. Without spoiling things, there are multiple Raptors that occur, and as a result the drop tables have been averaged.\n- Fusion Simplified: Part 1 is here!\nIf you're asking yourself 'Where are my Fusion Cores and what is Endo?\", please read this section carefully! This section explains the conversion from a Fusion Core / Duplicate Mod fusion system to the Endo Fusion system.\nFusion in Warframe is one of the main systems that encourages investment in your Mod collection and Upgrading your gear. With calculated clicking and collecting, you can take your unranked Mods to top tier performers.\nWith the change to an Endo system we've removed the hidden complexity of Fusion. This Endo Fusion system maintains many aspects of the hold.\nWhat is Endo? Endo is Fusion energy incarnate. It is the raw resource that powers the process of Upgrading Mods. In essence, Endo serves as the simplifier in all things Fusion. All duplicate Mods can now be simply converted into Endo. Endo will now drop from enemies and missions where Fusion Cores used to be. Fusing with Endo makes the Mod Rank increases clear, as the system now only increases in whole Ranks. Partial upgrading with unclear requirements towards your next rank will no longer exist, and neither will wasted Fusion energy. The UI will tell you exactly how much Endo is needed for the next Rank, which gives you a clear goal to work toward. Any partial Mod upgrades before this Update will be refunded with equivalent Endo and Credits.\n- So how does the conversion actually work? The base conversion is:\n- 5 Endo = 1 Unranked Common Core.\n- Fusion Credit Costs are now averaged out since Endo is a static Resource and not skewed by Rarity or Polarity in the same way Mods and Fusion Cores were.\n- No more wasted Fusion Energy exists. Often times you'd Fuse a Mod with a Core and would lose some tail end fusion energy. Static Endo amounts mean this is no longer possible.\n- All Mods can now be Dissolved into Endo.\n- Fusion Core packs in the Market have been replaced with completely repriced Platinum Endo bundles.\n- Part 2 is coming soon and will include:\n- Treasures: discoverable ancient valuables that can be constructed and converted into high Endo quantities.\n- Trading of Endo (in the form of Treasures).\n- Augments!\nThe following Augment are available today from the appropriate Syndicate Offerings:\n- Nyx: Absorb: Assimilate - Nyx can move at 50% speed while using Absorb, but the area is reduced by half.\n- Nezha: Warding Halo: Safeguard - Can now be cast on allies with 50% effectiveness.\n- Atlas: Landslide: Path of Statues - Leave a trail for 12s that petrifies enemies for 6s.\n- General:\n- Added Rarity colour grading to the Relic Reward selection screen in Fissure missions.\n- Soft launch of colourblind door symbols!

In an effort to address your concerns and increase the overall playability of the mode we've implemented a number of new gameplay features, arenas, customizations, and back end systems. Read on below for further details:\n- New Weapon Skins!\nNew Conclave weapon skins for the following weapons can now be purchased for standing from Tehsin once you\u2019ve acquired the Typhoon rank:\n- Karak\n- Kraken\n- AkStiletto\n- Tipedo\n- Glaive\n- Soma\n- New Arena!\nSteel Meridian Themed Map: The valorous troops of the Steel Meridian were greatly pleased by the skill and honor found within Lunaro matches and have constructed a variant of the Arena for friendly Tenno to enjoy. Find the new map in rotation today.\n- New Warm-Up System!\nHaven't played any Lunaro since launch? Feeling a bit rusty? Well worry no more! The introduction of the new Lunaro Warm-Up system will take players currently waiting in a not full lobby and load them all into a practice session. These sessions will see all active players equipped with their own Lunaro so as to allow everyone the chance to practise basic game mechanics while waiting for additional loadings to join. Once a game is full and ready to begin the match will naturally progress to the proper Lunaro mode with goals, assists, and saves from the previous Warm-Up being wiped clear.\n'New Gameplay Mechanics!\nBall Magnet Guard: Many of the loudest complaints about Lunaro were directed to the frequency of possession changes that could occur when a scrum was formed. To help alleviate this we've introduced the Ball Magnet Guard mechanic. This mechanic will allow the player with the ball to absorb a couple of hits, both melee and check attacks, before they lose possession. Initiating a Ball Magnet Guard is as simple as holding down the Ball Magnet button after the Lunaro has been picked up.\nPassing is now a dedicated button. Defaulted to R, this dedicated pass button should make coordination and team play more viable, especially in high-latency environments.\nBringing up the Scoreboard can now be done with the TAB button bringing Warframe PvP in with more traditional PvP games.*\nPlease note: This change is also reflected in PvE game modes. Pressing TAB will bring up the Progress & Rewards screen without locking the player in place.\n- New PvP Matchmaking Rules!\nMuch of the feedback we've received from our seasoned PvP players and newcomers alike was our inscrutable matchmaking rules. We've attempted to stream lines and have separated the rules used to match players in PvE from those used for PvP. Specifics on these PvP specific matchmaking rules are as follows:\nWhen attempting to join a friend you will be placed on their team if there is available space. If you create a squad and then create/join a PvP lobby you will all be placed on the same team. Subsequent joiners will fill the opposing team slots. Inviting a Friend who is currently in a squad will attempt to being in the full squad into your current game/lobby. Attempting to join a PvP match without enough space for you and your squad will now present an error message indicating that there isn't space to accommodate everyone. A similar error message to the above will be displayed when a full Squad of 4 players attempts to join a Lunaro match. Invite and Friends Only Lobbies now have a \"Switch Team\" option.\n- New Penalty/Reward System!\nAnother common gripe that has sometimes been affecting our competitive PvP modes was one that affects almost all games of this nature; rage quitters. While any system we introduce won't be able to completely solve this issue we've enacted a consequence system that will hopefully curb some of the more numerous instances:\n- We now track players who quit out of matches including those using the Alt-F4 method.\n- The Penalty system has 2 stages; a warning and a penalty applied state:\n- The warning stage will appear on the Landing Craft after the game detects that you've quit out of a match prematurely.\n- The Penalty Applied state will kick in after a certain % of your last games are determined to have been prematurely left. This state results in an XP Penalty of 75%.\n- Player's can climb back out of the Penalty Applied state by completing a corresponding amount of full matches.\n- While also negatively affecting rage quitters, we want to encourage those who continue to play while short on players and those who play multiple matches in a row.\n- Completing a match you were short on will result in a +20% boost to XP and Standing.\n- Completing subsequent matches will results in 10% more XP and Standing after the first match.\n- New Custom Lunaro Bindings!\nWith the launch of Lunaro on Consoles we introduced full customization options for Lunaro controls. With this update we will be introducing the same functionality for PC keyboard and mouse users.\nHead over to the Options screen to configure your Lunaro bindings as you see fit!\n- Soft Launch: Player Hosted Servers\nAnother major complaint directed toward our Conclave game modes has been the potential for laggy experiences due to the game running on our peer to peer system. With this update we will be rolling out the first stages of a potential solution to this issue: volunteer player hosted servers - we've got the tools in place to allow you to host Lunaro.\nAt this stage volunteer servers are limited to running Lunaro only, and require a separate dedicated computer to host.\nThe initial roll-out will be conducted via an invite-only process due to the need to gauge scalability and success. We will be using this soft launch to gather valuable feedback and stats and once we determine that the system is ready to provide the best experience we will be moving forward with a full scale public release.Cambios:\n- The Jat Kittag has received the PBR treatment!\n- Infested Runners and Chargers will now resort to a projectile attack only on the condition that they have no chance of melee attacking you.\n- Infested Maggots will now only attach to targets after a jump if they are still in range (possible for target to move out of latch range between jump animation start/end)\n- Bosses now appear on your mini-map as a red 'destroy/kill' marker instead of the yellow marker for consistency.\n- Reduced the reaction time and animation for enemies being corrupted by Void Fissures.\n- Void Fissure Junction challenges can now be completed on any planet.\n- Tweaked the Archwing Mastery Rank test to reflect recent Archwing movement changes.\n- Increased the Spy mission timer in the Vor\u2019s Prize quest.\n- Reduced Shield Lancer spawn chance during Vor\u2019s boss battle in the Vor\u2019s Prize quest.\n- War no longer glows when holstered.\n- Updated Chroma\u2019s tail cloth physics.\n- Minorly tweaked the emblem placement on the right Pakal shoulder armour to prevent clipping.\n- Improved spawning in Archwing open-space Exterminate missions.\n- Adjusted holster position for the Nunchaku hip style.\n- Moved Spy from Adrastea- Jupiter to Amalthea- Jupiter, and changed Adrastea to a Corpus Sabotage mission.\n- Adjusted emblem offsets for Heavy, Regular and Thin Kubrow bodies.\n- Tweaked location of Mariana - Earth node so the Vor's Prize mission text doesn't overlap the next node's text.\n- Decreased Nekros\u2019 Desecrate delay slightly to make it more popcorny.\n- Moved the '3 Spy data extractions' Junction Challenge to Neptune- Pluto to replace '3 waves of Archwing Interception' now that Jupiter-Saturn requires players to defeat Raptor on Europa.\n- Elixir Blueprints now appear under the Keys category, instead of Gear in the Foundry.\n- Kavats no longer use their Pounce ability when trying to be stealthy and have the Pounce mod equipped.\n- Tweaked New Loka\u2019s hub room to reduce amount of mist and make water a bit less transparent.\n- Pursuit ship turrets are now randomized rather (to prevent one side of the ship having only rocket-turrets and the other side only auto-turrets).\n- Fixed an issue where the Dark Split Sword would show a Mire when being built in the Foundry.\n- Fixed the poor lighting in New Loka\u2019s Relay Syndicate room.\n- Fixed a text error in the End of Mission screen.\n- Fixed speed buff abilities carrying over to Operators during Focus.\n- Fixed Nyx\u2019s Absorb camera FX remaining after a host migration.\n- Fixed an Infested object blocking the door near the end of the Once Awake quest.\n- Fixed the large majority of Earth Alerts being Erpo Archwing Alerts.\n- Fixed the Atlas Tartarus helmet not appearing in Alert cycles.\n- Fixed the Wukong Dasheng helmet not appearing in Alert cycles.\n- Fixed various clipping issues with Inaros.\n- Fixed Loki\u2019s Disarm not working for Junction Specters against players.\n- Fixed Ivara's Prowl ability scanning enemies that don\u2019t have drop table items (ie turrets and cameras).\n- Fixed Infested objects appearing in Vor\u2019s boss tileset in the Vor\u2019s Prize quest.\n- Fixed Rhino being able to activate his heavy landing Passive on all ground slams.\n- Fixed the Rending Crane stance Mod having a text path for its default combo.\n- Fixed an issue where interrupting a reload wouldn't usually cancel the reload animation.\n- Fixed loss of functionality when cancelling a mission while the screen is fading out (When the countdown timer is < 1 second).\n- Fixed Left Leg customizations applying to both legs for some Warframes.\n- Fixed overlapping localization text on the Spinning Needle combo screen.\n- Fixed spawning in Archwing missions backwards.\n- Fixed/improved the death FX on surveillance drones (Regulators).\n- Fixed a disabled laser grid in a Corpus Spy level.\n- Fixed Oberon\u2019s Renewal projectile not applying the Client\u2019s energy color.\n- Fixed the Porta Armour energy orb showing up on the Lunaro Riv Min and Riv Comp right leg pieces.\n- Fixed emblem placement on the Dendra Right Shoulder Guard.\n- Fixed Junction list on some planets overlapping parts of the planet.\n- Fixed missing FX on hackable Moa cabinets for Clients.\n- Fixed crash when you destroy a Blunt with projectiles stuck to it.

Energy (or Health if you use the Despoil Augment) are consumed on Desecration.\n- Corpses that enter the Desecrate radius will be eligible for desecration. The first corpse 'heats up' slowly for a couple seconds and then the rest occur in rapid succession (like popcorn).\n- Each enemy desecrated will now cost 10 Energy (or Health if the Despoil Augment is equipped). This is affected by Efficiency Mods.\n- Health orbs are no longer guaranteed drops from pilfered corpses. They are now tied in with the chance for additional loot drops.\nShadows of the Dead:\n- The number of Shadows spawned has been reduced to 7 and is no longer affected by Mods. This is a necessary change for performance on all platforms. To compensate for this, Nekros now spawns stronger Shadows prioritized by heavy unites killed with Shield multiplier and draw aggro more heavily.\n- Shadows now live until they die with Health decay over time that is affected by Duration instead of Strength.\n- Shadows of the Dead can be recast while active to spawn new Shadows to replace dead ones, and refill the Health/Shields of the current Shadows.\n- *Recasting Shadows of the Dead will also teleport your Shadows to you within limits. (if they are >10m and <40m away)\n- The Shield of Shadows Augment has been reviewed to maintain efficacy with these changes.\nOther:\n- Changed Nekros\u2019 Despoil Augment to reflect his Desecrate changes.\n- Nekros\u2019 Shadows of the Dead Augment - Shield of Shadows - now displays current % damage mitigation as a HUD buff.\nWe welcome your feedback on the Nekros changes here:\n[Specters of the Rail: Hotfix 2.1 - Nekros Changes](https://forums.warframe.com/topic/685421-specters-of-the-rail-hotfix-21-nekros-changes/)\n- Vaulted Relics will now appear in the Codex (ie: Relics that are not currently in circulation that you may own).\n- The Codex section for Relics and Arcanes will now show items you've discovered but don't own (like Mods do so you can see the drop sources to farm some more).\n- Tweaked the TennoGen Mesa Falcon Helmet tint.\n- Updated the TennoGen Rota Syandana materials.\n- Increased the brightness of the Guides of The Lotus Sigil.\n- Updated the Burston mesh in the Stalker diorama.\n- Fixed Dark Sector Credit rewards being unintentionally cut in half.\n- Fixed Grineer Napalm and Scorch\u2019s targeting/shooting you through walls.\n- Fixed \"Space-time Distortion\" as seen\n[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPhCAH8yWq0).\n- Fixed Archwing Impact, Slash, and Puncture Mods giving incorrect bonuses to stats.

With those items safe in the Prime Vault, the question becomes what will happen to their respective Relics. If you didn\u2019t catch Devstream #77, their Relics will no longer be obtainable once those items are sealed in the Vault. For those that have the Relics in your inventory, you can continue to use them until you\u2019ve exhausted your stockpile.\nA new AXI V3 RELIC will be obtainable in the wild that contains a mix of items from the vaulted Relics that contained Mag Prime, Dakra Prime, and Boar Prime.\nAs per Devstream #77, you can expect us to have a drop table up for all Relic locations this week. Please note that right now, the AXI V3 Relic is found in Orokin Derelict Survival reward tables\nAs for Baro Ki\u2019Teer and his upcoming goodies this week, his prices have been adjusted to better suit Relics. The values that we will initially be looking at are:\n- Common slotted Items (15)\n- Uncommon slotted items (45)\n- Rare slotted items (100)\nThese testing values are highly subject to change. Please, plan and spend accordingly.Cambios:\n- The Vectis has received the PBR treatment!\n- Detonite/Fieldron rewards from Invasion missions will now always be a bundle of 3.\n- Changed how Simaris\u2019 Synthesis Target Standing is decided in a group: you now get Standing if you have a Synthesis Scanner equipped, are actively playing, and it's your daily target or you are within shared XP range of the target.\n- Planet Nav Segments can now be sold for 5 Credits due to them no longer required to progress through the new Star Chart.\n- Disabled elevators and made ramps useable for AI in Corpus Ice Planet tilesets.\n- Improved Grineer Shipyard level containment to alleviate issues like Zephyr bonking heads, Wukong not being able to float around in Cloud Walker, etc.\n- Reduced the Odonata crafting costs and replaced Control Module with Neurodes for better new user experience/path.\n- Optimized Hydroid Tentacle Swarm ability to improve performance issues as per:\n[this thread](https://forums.warframe.com/topic/662786-hydroids-tentacle-swarm-causing-severe-fps-drops/)\n- Arctic Eximus Snow Globe blocks radial damage, but will no longer block damage from sources inside the globe.

With your suggestions and comments in place, we are continuing to tweak Void Fissures/Relics where necessary with the aim to reduce repetition issues and tie this mechanic into the lore of Warframe. The Void is an entity that corrupts, and Void Fissures are no different.\nThere is no longer just one 'Void Fissure', Void Fissures can occur again and again as the Void's corrupting energy tears through the Solar System. Fissures now spawn dynamically throughout the level near groups of enemies. The Fissure will corrupt any nearby enemies immediately after spawning. This buffs the enemy, and resets their health/shields. It will also spawn a couple Orokin units along with them, some being Eximus after a certain amount of Fissures. Fissures despawn after a period of time.\nThe corrupted and newly spawned Orokin units have a chance to drop Reactant, which are auto pickups (no more context action). Once you collect enough, you qualify for the Void Projection reward, and one of your weapons or your Warframe will be buffed for a short period of time based on Era of Void Relic brought. You will be given a random amount of Void Trace as well after collecting enough Reactant. Fissures will continue to spawn throughout the mission.\n- Void Traces cap is now Mastery Rank based (100 + 50 * MR).\n- Reactant marker now uses the Void Tear icon. The marker is only visible if players don't have enough Reactant.\n- Reactant uses a drop range (kill x amount for guaranteed drop) instead of drop chance.\n- \u201cEndless\u201d Void Fissure missions are now truly endless with the exception of Defense and Interception.\n- Your Equipped Relic information will now be shown in the Squad info dropdown box (where Equipped Dragon keys appears).\n- *Traces are given when you get 10/10 Reactant (no relic needed) and rewarded at End of Mission (between a range of 6-30).\n- Fixed being rewarded 0 Salvage instead of 500 for completing the Venus to Mercury Junction and Earth to Venus Junction.\n- Fixed losing functionality upon check the Clan Statistics screen in Navigation and attempting to back out.\n- Fixed meshes getting distorted when Field of View was increased (either deliberately or from effects like Volt Speed or Mesa Peacemaker).\n- Fixed Relics not being consumed for Clients who disconnect on the Fissure reward selection screen.\n- Fixed rare crash when switching levels.

What ghosts lurk the chambers of abandoned Junctions of a past era?\nFind a new way to experience the Origin System with the complete rework of the Star Chart.\nThis redesign of the original Star Chart will bring back the nostalgic roadmap design making it easier for you to travel the Origin System. The map is dynamic; zoom in and out and drag your way around the Origin System. Specific regions and missions will be easier to locate. Also, it will be clear to see which Missions you need to complete thanks to new Junctions -- routes between planets -- guiding you on where to go next.\nWe've replaced and re-assigned many missions, including the removal of Deception and the not-so-popular Archwing Defense.\nDifficulty, planet progression, and enemy levels have been reassigned to better reflect the modern Solar System.\nDedicated memorials have been set up in Relays to display the names of contributing Founders!\nJunctions:\n- Specters of the Rail live here - you must show you are worthy to conquer the Junction and ignite its Planetary travel power.\n- Junctions link travel - all players new and old must complete the Task list to activate the Junctions for progression and rewards.\n- Junctions reward players with Mastery upon completion! Please note this Mastery reward is quite large, and offsets any Mastery points lost in the Star Chart changes of nodes per planet.\n- What does this mean for Quests?\nQuest acquisition are now earned at specific Junctions:\n- Venus- Mercury Junction: Once Awake, Howl of the Kubrow\n- Earth- Mars Junction: The Archwing\n- Mars- Phobos Junction: Stolen Dreams\n- Jupiter- Europa Junction: The New Strange, Limbo Theorem Blueprint\n- Saturn- Uranus Junction: Natah, Clem Quest\n- Uranus- Neptune Junction: The Second Dream\n- Pluto- Sedna Junction: Hidden Messages Blueprint\n- Pluto- Eris Junction: Patient Zero Blueprint, The Jordas Precept Blueprint\n*Sands of Inaros Blueprint is still obtained from Baro Ki'Teer.\n- Void 2.0\nVoid Fissure: A dynamic occurrence throughout the Origin System - a tear in the world of Void energy from Eras past. Represented in the World State Window and occurs in 4 different tiers.\nVoid Relic: Ancient Relics that react to Void Fissures to reveal treasures within.\nVoid Traces: Raw Void energy that drops in the process of uniting Relics and Fissures. Can be used to Refine Void Relics to yield more rare rewards in your Orbiter.\nReactant: Drops in missions and must be used in the Void Fissure sealing process.\nRefinement: The Process of improving the likelihood of Rare rewards from Void Relics.\nEra: An old Orokin age.\nLith / Meso / Neo / Axi: 4 Distinct Eras of the Orokin past, all suddenly manifesting through Void Fissures in the Solar Map.\n- T1 Keys have turned into Lith Era Relics.\n- T2 Keys have turned into Meso Era Relics.\n- T3 Keys have turned into Neo Era Relics\n- T4 Keys have turned into Axi Era Relics.\nVoid Relic Segment: Found on a Junction, used to Refine Void Relics.\n- Void Fissures & Relics\nAfter years of new content releases and updated items to collect, there is a certain irony in calling the Void the \u201cvoid\u201d. Until Specters of the Rail, getting specific Prime parts was a repetitive and regimented process. Each Tower mission has a corresponding key and reward table, and if you want one of those rewards, you need to stock up on the appropriate key and repeat the same mission until you accomplish your goal. That all changes with the introduction of Relics. Instead of running the same mission repeatedly, Relics allow you to dynamically acquire the rewards you want by playing Void Tear missions that appear on any planet, and there will always be Void Fissures active. Collecting cool rewards is a fundamental aspect of Warframe, and this new Void system is designed to make it more fun and immersive - with Void Fissures ripping into the very fabric of the Origin System!\n*Please note that Void Fissures will not be available for Assassinate and endless mission types - excluding Survival - for Launch. Further mission support will be coming shortly.\nRead the Developer Workshop here:\n[link](https://forums.warframe.com/topic/667312-dev-workshop-projections-void-tears/)\nAs a result of this change:\n- Syndicate Void Key Pack has changed to Relic Pack.\n- Void Key Pack from the Market and Daily Tribute has changed to Relic Pack.\n- As for our good friend Baro, his sales/prices will be monitored closely to take new economy into account in terms of Ducat acquisition.\n- Access to the Derelicts is remaining the same.\nNew Resource - Void Traces! To help players acquire higher quality Void Relic's we've introduced a new resource: Void Traces. Void Traces are guaranteed to drop by sealing a Void Fissure. Players will be able to spend these in the Void Relic Segment of their Landing Craft to refine Void Relics. While each individual Relic will have a predetermined set of items that can be acquired from within them, their quality level will affect the likelihood of rarer items being received once the Relic is used to seal a Void Fissure.\nThe Refinement costs for improving an INTACT Void Relic are as follows:\n- EXCEPTIONAL = 25 Void Traces\n- FLAWLESS = 50 Void Traces\n- RADIANT = 100 Void Traces\nDragon Keys:\nDragon Keys will now require 10 Void Traces to craft instead of Void Keys. Their blueprints have also been moved to a more appropriate place: the Orokin Lab!\nHow to acquire Relics:\nYou can get Relics by playing through certain regular mission types (typically endless missions). Any Void Keys you have will be converted into Relics of a similar Era. Relics are not restricted to Towers and precise missions the way Void Keys are, so all Void Keys of a particular Era will be converted into Relics of a similar reward level.\nWarframe Mission Sound 2.0\nThis Update brings a huge change to the way our distance and obstruction sound works across all of Warframe. All distant sounds now feel properly spatialized and obstructed sounds now have the feeling of walls and more. Each shot, each character sound, each infested squeal will now bring you a more visceral and deep sound experience.\nWe updated many weapon sounds to have elements that take advantage of this new sound system.\nArchwing Overhaul!\n- Archwing has been upgraded to a full six degrees of freedom! Now, you\u2019ll be able to pilot your Archwing like a true flight simulator with full 360 degree yaws and pitches. (Note: submersible missions will still use the old controls)\n- New Archwing UI and control bindings to further enhance your flying experience!\n- New Eximus Archwing units have been deployed throughout the Origin System!\n- Syndicates now offer Archwing components!\n- Reduced the total number of Archwing nodes to 8 - one of each type for Grineer and Corpus.\nNew Archwing Mission Types!\nArchwing Pursuit (Saturn - Pandora)\n- Hunt down a heavily defended Grineer Ship and destroy it by fighting through the ship\u2019s defenses, such as: energy shields, turrets, and mines.\nArchwing Rush (Phobos - Kepler)\n- Reach hostile supply ships and destroy them before they escape. The more ships you destroy within the given time, the greater the reward.\nNew Archwing Mods & Weapons!\n- Archwing Melee - Agkuza: Tear apart incoming enemies with this massive hooked blade.\n- Archwing Primary - Cyngas: Unload deadly accurate bursts of mayhem.\n- New Dual Stat Archwing Mods (At full rank):\n- Arch-Melee: Meteor Crash - +60% Impact + 60% Status Chance\n- Arch-Melee: Nebula Bore - +60% Puncture +60% Status Chance\n- Arch-Melee: Astral Slash - +60% Slash +60% Status Chance\n- Arch-Gun: Comet Blast - +90% Impact +90% Status Chance\n- Arch-Gun: Quasar Drill - +90% Puncture +90% Status Chance\n- Arch-Gun: Zodiac Shred - +90% Slash + 90% Status Chance\n- Augments (At full rank):\n- Afterburner (Elytron - Core Vent augment) Blast damage ignites exhaust fumes for 12 seconds. Enemies passing through the flames take 500 Heat damage.\n- Cold Snap (Itzal - Cosmic Crush augment) The black hole saps the area of heat, freezing enemies in range. Enemies near the black hole are completely frozen for 5 seconds.\n- Energy Field (Odonata - Energy Shell augment) Energy Shell applies to allies within 35m.\nNew Support Archwing: Amesha!\nTransform into a winged guardian!\nGet this Archwing today in the Market or Tenno Clan Research!\n1: Watchful Swarm - Tiny drones orbit the Warframe or an ally, and intercept enemy fire.\n2: Benevolent Decoy - Creates beacons that drew enemy fire, converting the damage into healing pulses.\n3: Warding Grace - Renders the Warframe and nearby allies immune to Status Effects, while slowing nearby enemies.\n4: Vengeful Rush - All damage taken is transformed into Energy, while abilities gain enhanced range, duration and power. Affects the Warframe and nearby allies.\n- Market Overhaul!\nThe Warframe Market got a facelift! Two big motivators behind this rework are pretty straight-forward: a) to make it easier to find what you want and to see what\u2019s available; and b) to allow the Market to grow as more content is added in-game. Highlights of this upgrade include better item categories (especially for Cosmetics) and a brand new search function to help you fine-tune your results. A new hide/show owned button will make browsing for new gear a breeze, but for those who need to save up for the big ticket items, the new Wishlist feature will help you keep track of your must-haves. Feeling particularly generous? You can see your friends\u2019 Wishlists and gift them what their heart desires!\nA large majority of Market-related complaints we receive relate to the confusion between built items (aka Platinum-purchased) and Blueprints. The current Market set-up can misguide players into thinking that Warframes, Weapons, and Sentinels aren\u2019t craftable in-game, so we condensed the Built items and Blueprints into the same page. Information about build costs, stats, blueprint location, and more, will be separated into 3 tabs on this page to help players learn all they need to know about the item in order to make an informed purchase!\nPrice Revisions\n- Frugal Credits Bundle: 50k Credits for 50 Platinum.\n- High Roller Credit Bundle: 175k Credits for 90 Platinum.\n- Loki*: 175 Platinum\n- Mag*: 75 Platinum\n*These prices were swapped to reflect the change in Starter status.\nItem Changes/Additions:\n- 3 Forma Bundle: 35 Platinum\n- 30 Day Resource Booster: 200 Platinum\n- Fieldron Samples replaced with Fieldron - 1 for 10 Platinum\n- Mutagen Sample replaced with Mutagen Mass - 1 for 10 Platinum\n- Detonite Ampule replace with Detonite Injector - 1 for 10 Platinum\n[Coming in a near Hotfix]\n- Gold Fusion Pack: 15 Fusion Cores (14 R5 Rare, 15th has a tiny chance to be Legendary) for 80 Platinum.\n- Silver Fusion Pack: 10 Fusion Cores (5 R5 Rare, 5 possible R5 Rares) for 50 Platinum.\n- Bronze Fusion Pack: 5 Fusion Cores (3 R5 Rare, 2 Uncommon) for 35 Platinum.\nFinally, keep an eye out to other UI tweaks that should make your Market experience easier and more accessible!

Once signature is acquired, you will need to research a Kavat Incubator Upgrade Segment from your Dojo or purchase one from the Market to house your new Kavat Companion!\n- New Kavat Customizations\nWysar Kavat Armor and Saraba Kavat Armor\nNew Lore System: Fragments A new world of Lore awaits!\nMysterious Fragments have been found scattered across the Solar System. Scanning these will unlock information in your Codex that expands on the nature of the Warframe universe.

If you\u2019re the kind of Tenno who needs to get your Skana looking just right, you\u2019ll now have the option to tweak the rotation and offset of your melee weapons to perfection.\n- ADI Holster Collection (purchase through the Market)\nA collection of alternate styles for holstering and drawing a range of melee weapons.\n- Item Linking in Chat!\nItem linking is a popular pastime in many MMOs, and now you\u2019ll be able to link items in Warframe\u2019s chat by typing \u201c[\u201c plus the name of the item you wish to link! Clicking the link will open a description of that item. We hope this will also help the [Flow] when trading your [Spare Parts]!\nGeneral Additions:\n- Your Arsenal will now display the corresponding skin icon when equipped rather than the underlying Warframe.\n- Completely revisited old tilesets and added new rare loot spawn points for Syndicate Medallions and more. This should also fix issues with some missions only having 3 or so Syndicate Medallions to collect.\n- The Alert generator has had some trimming done with the removal of Void Keys and some Credit Alerts which ultimately reduces the time it takes to complete an Alert Cycle from approximately 15 days to approximately 10 days. All Credit Alerts now have a chance to spawn with a random Fusion Core as well. With this faster Cycling through Alerts, you should see more things you want return faster!\n- Added Operator Customization improvements.

This design choice was implemented as we felt the current moveset provided by the PvE stances didn't quite fit the feel of our PvP gameplay. Using animations from existing melee Stances, alternative versions have been created with a focus on gap closing moves and shorter combos to better fit the pace of Warframe Conclave.\nA list of these new Conclave Melee Stance mods can be found below. Each of these mods can be purchased from Teshin at Rank 1.\n- Argent Scourge (Polearm)\n- Biting Piranha (Dual Daggers)\n- Celestial Nightfall (Glaive)\n- Crashing Havoc (Hammer)\n- Crashing Timber (Staves)\n- Cunning Aspect (Rapier)\n- Dividing Blades (Dual Sword)\n- Fateful Truth (Katana)\n- Lashing Coil (Whip)\n- Last Herald (Sword and Shield)\n- Mafic Rain (Nunchaku)\n- Noble Cadence (Heavy Blade)\n- Piercing Fury (Dagger)\n- Quaking Hand (Fists)\n- Rending Wind (Machete)\n- Rising Steel (Sword)\n- Scarlet Hurricane (Claws)\n- Shadow Harvest (Scythe)\n- Star Divide (Tonfa)\n- Tainted Hydra (Sword + Whip)\n- Vicious Approach (Fists + Feet)\nAll melee weapons available in Conclave have had their damage adjusted to work with their new stances.\n- Abilities & Augments vs Nullifiers\nWe\u2019ve added some changes to Nullifiers - rather, we\u2019ve fixed how they affect others on the battlefield. We've gone over every player ability and augment to provide predictable interactions with Nullifier bubbles and ability immune enemies. Below are the rules that we have adhered by to offer a consistent avenue for players to strategize against foes in-battle.\n- Abilities will not affect players or enemies within a Nullifier bubble.\n- Effects of an ability on both players and enemies will be removed when entering Nullifier bubbles.\n- A Warframe\u2019s active abilities will be deactivated upon entering a Nullifier bubble.\n- Projectiles spawned by an ability will be deflected when they encounter a Nullifier bubble. For example, Ember\u2019s Fireball and Ash\u2019s Shuriken will be deflected.\n- Abilities that exist independent of their creator will not be deactivated if the Warframe enters a nullifier, but will be destroyed if touched by the bubble itself. For example, Frost\u2019s Snowglobe will not disappear when Frost enters the bubble, but will be destroyed if the bubble comes into contact with the Snowglobe sphere.\n- Interception Changes & Fixes\n- Adjusted the enemy counts for each mission; in most cases the spawn counts were increased.\n- Improved enemy tactics to better plan assaults on player-controlled towers; by staging units ahead of time they can be more effective and draw the action to different points around the map.\n- Changed how the different types of enemy unit are sent into the fray. Historically you'd see higher-tier units mid-way through the first round and there would be no escalation after that; you should now see more infantry in the first round and then more support and heavy units if you chose to stay to intercept more transmissions.\n- Tuned the enemy tables to fix the cases where certain levels were 50% enemies that couldn't capture points (eg: Drones).\n- Corrupted Vor in T4 Interception will no longer delay the end of round countdown (just the end of round) so that if he's the last enemy you aren't stuck waiting as long.\n- Fixed the problem where low-level Interception missions were flooded with Eximus\u2019.\n- Added an Interception Mission to Sedna, Berehynia.\nChanges:\n- Toxic Ancient's and Ancient Disrupter Auras will no longer stack with multiple Ancients of the same type.\n- Oberon\u2019s Reckoning has a chance to make enemies drop health orbs which, when grabbed by you, heal your companions which revive them.\n- Fire rate Pistol mods will now affect Mesa's Peacemaker.\n- Added a PBR pass on materials for a variety of older Grineer and Infested levels.\n- Made improvements to the spawn logic for Convergence pickups in Survival and Excavation missions.\n- Phobos Tileset is now on Mars, and all Phobos missions are now on Asteroid Tileset.\n- Increased Dark Split-Swords Critical Chance while dual wielding by to 25% and Critical Multiplier to 2.5x.\n- Slightly increased the Dark Split Sword dual wield attack speed.\n- Slightly decreased the Dark Split Sword Heavy Blade attack speed.\n- Increased the Dark Split Sword Heavy Blade Element Damage to 90 and Status Chance to 25%\n- Increased the Twin Basolk Status Chance to 40% and increased Elemental damage to 65.\n- Slightly Increased Twin Basolk attack speed.\n- Increased Twin Basolk Ground Slam damage by 4x , attack radius to 7.5m, and Status Chance to 65%.\n- Twin Basolk Ground Slams can now ragdoll enemies.\n- Increased the amount of Impact damage done with Stradavar automatic fire while decreasing the Puncture and Slash damage these attacks do.\n- Increased the amount of Puncture damage done with Stradavar semi-automatic fire while decreasing the amount of Slash damage these attacks do.\n- Slightly decreased the amount of damage done by Stradavar automatic fire and increased the amount of damage done by semi-automatic attacks.\n- Increased the Stradavar Status Chance to 15%.\n- Polished the hit detection of melee weapons within Nullifier bubbles. Some weapons, like the Tonbo for example, would strike the Nullifier bubble first, followed by the Nullifier agent in the same strike. However, the damage would only result on the bubble! The weapons can now strike both the bubble and the agent on the same strike, and the agent will take damage as long you are inside the bubble for the attack.\n- Removed in-mission challenges for all Mastery rank tests.\n- Removed two small sections on Nyx Prime that were un-tintable.\n- Adjusted the Market icon size of the Akstilleto and Ballistica.\n- Changed the way lighting works on Sigils in an attempt tone down excessive bloom.\n- Sortie Missions can now have more environmental wrinkles, traps, and obstacles within. Stay Alert!\n- Made improvements to the animation look and feel of thrown weapons while holding a Datamass.\n- As a result of wanting to reduce the amount of playerbase splitting that the Syndicate Mission rank generation created, we've reduced this to simply have 7 missions per Syndicate.\n- At Rank 1 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 1, 2, 3.\n- At Rank 2 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 2, 3, 4.\n- At Rank 3 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 3, 4, 5.\n- At Rank 4 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 4, 5, 6.\n- At Rank 5 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 5, 6, 7.\n- As a result, now you are more likely play with other members of the Syndicate at close ranks to you. You will still now have 3 Syndicate missions active in your World state menu, but you should now have more people do them with!\n- Warframe Helmet blueprints are now labeled as \u2018Neuroptics\u2019. Please note that when trading components, full Warframe sets now contain Systems, Chassis, and Neuroptics (previously Helmet) as components.\n- Polished a variety of environment materials that were too bright.\n- Polished a variety of old tileset decoration placements and layouts.\n- Players can now choice to cancel an undesired squad migration if the migration is occurring while in a lobby.\n- Updated certain interactable Orokin Derelict consoles with new meshes.\n- Improved your Sentinels responsiveness to catching up to you and staying at shoulder level when you're moving quickly.\n- Rescue targets can now shoot while following players. Teleport actions will still take precedent over this behavior when making your way to extraction.\n- Reduced the Syndicate buff FX to help aiming visibiltiy as per:\n[https://forums.warframe.com/topic/637829-syndicate-effects-are-a-bit-much/](https://forums.warframe.com/topic/637829-syndicate-effects-are-a-bit-much/)\n- Increased the spawn rate of Rare Crates in The Jordas Verdict to match the Law of Retribution.\n- The Archwing ability stat screen will now show the correct range for abilities depending on context. (E.g. Blink used to show 100m, but in space you are 0.25x scale so distances are effectively 4x as far. So in space Blink will now show 400m. In water ranges are reduced, so Blink will show 39.69m.)\n- Gave Rescue hostages their own (incredibly generous) cover evaluators so their cover findings don't conflict with their behaviour. Gave them larger vision range so they react to dangers behind / next to them and not just when they get shot by them first.\n- Improved finisher hit detection for multiple weapons. Reticles will now flash red when a finisher can be performed and with each hit for multistrike finisher moves.\n- Multistrike finisher moves will have their damage split amongst each hit instead of now being delivered all at the end.\n- Propaganda Drone damage reduction buffs no longer stack.\n- Improved jump detection. Before players could prematurely double jump when just about to fall off a ledge, when falling off a small edge, or when walking down a steep incline. Regular jumps will now be performed in these scenarios.\n- Improved Dojo and Liset decoration placement code.\n- Vauban\u2019s Bastille now works on Corpus air units. (Attack Drones, etc.)\n- Increased the drop rate of Automatic Trigger.\n- Increased the drop rate of Vermillion Storm.\n- Improved squad merging code to better facilitate Lunaro matchmaking.\n- Improved migration code to better handle migrations occurring during PvP team selection phase.\n- Archwing augment mods now display an <ARCHWING> tag to help differentiate them.\n- Improve the physics on the Ki Teer Syandana.\n- Archwing Inventory system now utilizes our Inventory Slot mechanic.
