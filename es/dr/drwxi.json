Meanwhile, Nepeta cataria L., \ncommonly called \"Cat mint\" or \"Toronjil\", with some \nsimilar properties, often replacing M. officinalis  in \nthe market, although their chemical composition is not completely matched, and contains an iridoid potentially toxic (nepetalactone). It is therefore necessary to establish diacritic parameters to differentiate these species, both at crude drug level, mixtures and extracts. Samples from various sources in Argentina were studied and documental specimens are preserved in the Herbarium  UNSL. Anatomical sections \nwere analyzed, and quantitative micrographic parameters were obtained, together with HPLC and FTIR spectra from methanolic and aqueous lyophilized extracts. Significant differences were detected in the prevailing smell foliage, morphology of leaves and inflorescences, trichomata type, palisade ratio, veinlet termination number, rosmarinic acid concentration (with  distinctive \nHPLC profiles), and the CO/CH relationships obtained by FTIR from the extracts, that together allow adequate differentiation of both drugs, even when they were ground or powdered.16M.

Despite their \"natural\" origin, some \nplants are not entirely safe showing both adverse effects and interactions with other herbs, supplements, medicines, foods and even laboratory diagnostic tests (10, 13, 35). The quality, safety and efficacy have to be determined carefully by chemical complexity and intrinsic biological variation of these drugs (32, 36) in particular with reference to numerous plant species used in the treatment of central nervous system disorders (6).\nMelissa officinalis  L. has been incorporated into many pharmacopoeias, and \nis consumed primarily as flavored tea, as infusion or decoction. It is used in the symptomatic treatment of conditions related to the digestive and nervous systems (4), and in traditional medicine, to treat insomnia, anxiety, migraines, hypertension, as well as gastric, bronchial and psychiatric conditions. Its essential oil ( Melissae  aetheroleum ) is an \nefficient antimicrobial agent, effective against gram-positive bacteria, as well as herpes viruses  (16, 28); so, it is a promissory agent in front to the resistant bacterial  strains.\nHowever, the marketed material does not always correspond to the official \nspecies. Often it is adulterated and, or substituted with Nepeta cataria L., another \naromatic Lamiaceae (37), a drug potentially toxic by the presence of an iridoid (nepetalactone ) and their diastereoisomers in its essential oil (26), and therefore \nincluded in restrictive lists (2). Other few species can be known by similar common \nnames, and may be involved in adulterations at local level due to misidentifications in the field during the harvest, or confused by poorly trained workers. Also the essential oil of M. officinalis is subject to tampering or replacement due to its high cost (17).\nA number of phytochemical and pharmacological researches were carried out on \nthese species, particularly on M. officinalis , a perennial and aromatic herb, whose dried \nleaves showed digestive, carminative, antiemetic, antispasmodic, sedative, anxiolytic and even antidepressant properties, among others, while its essential oil has antimicrobial, antifungal and antispasmodic actions (4, 6, 8, 29, 34). Meanwhile, N. cataria  also has \napplications predominantly in digestive disorders and nervous system affections, being used as a carminative, digestive and antispasmodic, and as an anxiolytic, sedative and antidepressant, even antihysteric, hypnotic and antiodontalgic  (8, 15). However,  very \nfew studies have been developed to determine the quality of the herbs and herbal formulations in these species (3), including comparative mineral content (24). 17Micrography, HPLC and FTIR of Melissa  and Nepeta\nTomo 46  \u2022   N\u00b0 2  \u2022   2014On the other hand, M. officinalis  stands out as an important potential source of \nrosmarinic acid (an ester of caffeic acid), along with other species of the same family \nespecially Mentha spicata L. (18, 25, 30), and even materials from hairy roots cultures \nof different Lamiaceae (12).\nThe aim of this study is to provide additional evidence (quantitative micrograph \nparameters, and HPLC and FTIR spectra) to identify fully the genuineness of the official drug, their mixtures and extracts by means of a number of diacritical characters.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nMaterials\nFresh samples were obtained from three Argentinean populations of each \nadventitious (N. cataria) and cultivated (M. officinalis ) plant species. A portion of the \nmaterial was intended for taxonomic documentation (voucher specimens): \na) Melissa officinalis : L. A. Del Vitto & E. M. Petenatti #9246 (UNSL).\nb) Nepeta cataria: L. A. Del Vitto, E. M. Petenatti & M. E. Petenatti #7437 (UNSL). The material devoted to morphoanatomical studies were fixed and preserved in \nFAA (formalin: acetic acid: alcohol). Undoubtedly identified material from Herbarium \nUNSL served as secondary standards. Additionally were analyzed 37 samples of medicinal herbs labeled \"Melissa\" and \"Toronjil\", purchased in health food stores, pharmacies and popular markets of the region, whose vouchers are preserved in the Herbal Section of the UNSL Herbarium, National University of San Luis. \nMethodsThe species were classified according to the classical taxonomic methodology. \nSemi-permanent preparations were obtained by freehand cut, coloration with iodine green-carmine alum and mounting in glycerin jelly (7). Fresh leaves for quantitative micrograph techniques were diaphanized (9) and stained with 1% safranin, determining the following parameters (10): stomatal number (SN), stomatal index (SI), palisade ratio (PR), vein-islet number (VIN) and veinlet termination number (VTN). SN was measured with a 40x objective and the other parameters with 20x objective. The market samples were hydrated with hot water and detergent and then treated in the same way as those fresh. Both histological preparations and secondary standards of plant drugs were deposited in the Herbarium of the Universidad Nacional de San Luis (UNSL).\nMacro- and micro-morphological observations were made using a stereomicroscope \nLeica M-10\n\u00ae (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Germany), and an optical microscope DMRB\u00ae \n(Leitz-Wetzlar, Germany), respectively; the photomicrographs were obtained with a digital camera EC-3\n\u00ae (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Germany) connected to the image \ncapture system LAS EZ\u00ae v software 1.7.1 (Leica Microsystems Ltd., Germany).18M. E. Petenatti et al.\nRevista de la Facultad de Ciencias AgrariasAerial plant parts (3 batches per each species) were harvested and dried in \nthe shade until hygroscopic moisture; later were grinded using a mill Wiley\u00ae 3379 \n(Thomas Wiley, USA) with a stainless steel container, and a sieve up to 0.50 mm \ndiameter. To prepare methanolic extracts (ME) and aqueous extracts (AE), 5g from \nthe three batches of each species were used. ME were obtained extracting the drug with cold methanol until color exhaustion (3 per 24 hours) and then evaporated under vacuum using a rotatory evaporator Rotavapor\n\u00ae R-210 (B\u00fcchi Labortechnik \nAG, Switzerland). AE were obtained according the Argentinean Pharmacopoeia (11), soaking 5g of crude drug in 100mL of boiling distilled water, covering the container for 5 min and removing the solid by filtration; the aqueous portion was lyophilized with manifold type drum LT-16 (Rificor\n\u00ae, Argentina). \nHPLC profiles were obtained from 1g of each extract, eluted with water: methanol \n(50:50; v/v) up to 100mL. Ten aliquots (20\u00b5L) for each batch were injected into an autosampler HPLC UltiMate\u00ae 3000 (Dionex, USA) with a diode array detector (DAD) and a Gemini\u00ae C18 (Phenomenex, USA) column (250 x 4mm i.d.; 5\u00b5m) termostated at 25\u00b0C, using the mobile phase water: methanol (50:50; v/v) run at a flow rate of 0.5mL min-1 during 30min.; the UV spectra were recorded in the range of 200-367nm. The chromatograms obtained for each species at 320 nm were compared with those of \na standard sample of \u226598% rosmarinic acid (Sigma Aldrich \u00ae); the data were processed \nwith a software Chromeleon\u00ae (Thermo Fisher Sci., USA).\nTo accomplish FTIR spectra, 12 batches per each population of the two species were \npelletized with KBr, making a dispersion of each solid sample (lyophilized EA or EM) \nin KBr (3:100 w/w) and homogenized in mortar and pestle. About 100 mg of the homogenized mixture was placed between two metal plates in the cylinder of a hydraulic press, then applying a pressure of 500 kg cm\n-2; allowed pressed 5 min., vented and \nplaced the tablet into a sample holder, then obtaining the spectra in a spectrophotometer Prot\u00e9g\u00e9\n\u00ae 460 (Nicolet), equipped with a CsI beamsplitter. Values were obtained with \na spectral resolution of 4 cm-1 in the range between 4000 and 460 cm-1.\nAll reagents used were of analytical and / or HPLC grade.\nThe data collected were subjected to statistical analysis (one-way ANOVA and \nthe instrumental own statistical programs).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nMelissa officinalis  L. subsp. officinalis  was described in 1753 \n(Linnaeus,  Species  plantarum  2: 592) and belongs to the Family Lamiaceae \n(nom. alt. Labiatae), Subfam. Nepetoideae, Tribe Mentheae. The pharmacopoeial \napproved name for dry leaves and herb of this species is Melissae folium  (34). \nThe vulgar names are \"melisa\", \"toronjil\" (Spanish), \"erva cidreira\" (Portuguese); \n\"balm\", \"lemon balm\" (English). For their part, Nepeta cataria L. was described at \nthe same time than the former (Linnaeus, Species plantarum  2: 570, 1753) and 19Micrography, HPLC and FTIR of Melissa  and Nepeta\nTomo 46  \u2022   N\u00b0 2  \u2022   2014belongs to the same tribe Mentheae; their vulgar names are \"nepeta\", \"hierba gatera\", \n\"menta de los gatos\", \"n\u00e9beda\" or \"toronjil\" (Spanish), \"erva-gateira\" (Portuguese), \n\"catmint\", \"catnip\", or \"catnep\" (English).\nQuantitative Micrograph and Leaf Anatomical CharactersThe leaves of M. officinalis  show a thin, smooth cuticle, except in the abaxial surface \non the nerves, that is finely striated. Both epidermis are unistrate with sinuate radial cell walls. The blade is hypostomatic (stomata present only on the abaxial epidermis), \nwith raised diacytic stomata, the number of stomata is 17.71 \u00b1 4.62, and the stomatal index had values   among 14.58 to 22.33. The palisade ratio ranged from 6.54 to 12.82. \nThe nerves are prominent on the abaxial surface.\nThe indument consists of four types of trichomes: two simple non-glandular, \nsome of them very short, 1-celled, conical, straight to clawed, and other \nlong, 2-5-celled, uniseriate, wide base and acute apex, with warty walls (around  the nerves  and margin  are 6-7-celled), with higher density in the back; \nand two types of glandular trichomes, some of them small, capitates, with 1- or 2-celled foot and 1-2-celled head, primarily present in the upper epidermis, and others large, peltate, short-footed, 1-celled, and spheroid or ovoid 8-celled head (the characteristic type of secretory trichome in Lamiaceae), present in depressions \nin the lower epidermis.\nThe trichomatic typology agrees with that reported for Lamiaceae by various \nauthors and in particular to this species by Padurariu et al. (2009). The mesophyll is \ndorsiventral with unistrate palisade parenchyma to the upper surface, with 3-4 cell layers of spongy parenchyma with small meatus to the lower surface. The collateral vascular bundles are coated by a non Kranz parenchymatic sheath that consists of \nseveral cell layers. Vein-islet number was 5.25 \u00b1 1.48, and the veinlet terminations \nnumber was 1.57 \u00b1 1.06.\nMeanwhile, a cross-section of the leaf of N. cataria show a dorsiventral structure \nwith similar features to M. officinalis , differing particularly in the indument, which is \nformed here by highly abundant simple non-glandular 3-5 celled trichomes, with very warty walls, and only one type of glandular trichome, with 2-celled foot and 1-celled head, lacking peltate trichomes that characterize Melissa officinalis . The blade is also \nhypostomatic, with raised diacytic stomata, the stomatal number is 16.21 \u00b1 3.26, and stomatal index had values   among 17.11 to 20.21. The palisade ratio ranged from \n2.93 to 3.98.\nThe mesophyll present a unistrate palisade parenchyma towards upper surface, \nwhile 3-4 cell layers spongy parenchyma occurs toward the lower surface. The vascular \nbundles, collateral, are covered by a non Kranz sheath parenchyma, and protected by \nangular collenchyma. Vein-islet number was 5.87 \u00b1 1.05, and the veinlet termination number was 3.13 \u00b1 1.25. A summary of the quantitative micrographic parameters is shown in table 1 (page 20).20M. E. Petenatti et al.\nRevista de la Facultad de Ciencias AgrariasTable 1. Quantitative micrographic parameters of M. officinalis and N. cataria.\nTabla 1.

Specific differences about stomatal number were not significant (p<0.05), while the stomatal index corresponding to M. officinalis  varies widely \n(14 to 22), which fully includes the narrower dispersion data that shows N. cataria \n(17 to 20). Palisade ratio of M. officinalis  ranges from about 6 to 13, a relatively high \nand significant value (p<0.05) compared to that of N. cataria (3 to 4). Vein islet number \nof both species was very similar, while the differences found in the veinlet termination number were significant (p<0.05), because in N. cataria this parameter is double that \nof M. officinalis . In summary, the most useful parameters to distinguish these drugs \nare palisade ratio (PR) and veinlet termination number (VTN).\nHigh Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)Applying HPLC techniques to samples of both species, as well as a standard of \nrosmarinic acid, resulted in the curves of figure 1, figure 2 (page 21) and the values   \nshown in table 2 (page 21).SNueSNleSIlePR VIN VTN\nMelissa officinalis 0 17.71\u00b14.62 14.58-22.33 6.54-12.82 5.25\u00b11.48 1.57\u00b11.06\nNepeta cataria 0 16.23\u00b13.21 17.11-20.21 2.90-  3.98 5.87\u00b11.05 3.11\u00b11.25\n7.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0   \n30.01.0002.0003.0004.000\nHPLC Standard of Rosmarinic Acid \n(1 mg L-1)mAU\nmin   1 - Rosmarinic Acid \u2013 19.967WVL:320 nm\n0\nUV spectrum of Rosmarinic Acid  19.78 min\n0.0\n 20.0 40.0 60.0 \n190 213225238250263275288300313325338350%\nnm 197.6\n329.1220.7\n200\nFigure 1.

The values obtained here were \nsimilar to those reported for various sources of both drugs (5, 20). \nAs the populations of N. cataria  which are adventitious and exceptionally cultivated \nin Argentina, the low concentration of rosmarinic acid, together with its nepetalactone content, we can affirm that this plant does not participate fully in the properties attributed and / or checked for M. officinalis , thereby constituting an adulterant, rather than a \nsuitable commercial substitute.7.0 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 22.5 25.0 27.5 30.0 1.2502.500  3.750\nmAU \n  min 1 - Rosmarinic Acid \u2013 21.107WVL:320 nm \nMelissa officinalis\n0\n7.0 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 22.5 25.0 27.5 30.05001.000mAU\nmin 1 - Rosmarinic Acid \u2013 20.063WVL:320 nm\nNepeta cataria\n01.500\nSamples Crude drug\n(g)Lyophilized residue\n(avg.)

Lej.), lacks nepetalactone, unlike other species \nand varieties of the genus, instead containing between 0.6 to 1.5 mg Kg-1 of rosmarinic \nacid as well as other phenolic acids, monoterpenes (nerol, geraniol, and citral), and \nflavonoids (21). Although from a taxonomic point of view this variety is no longer valid, being within the broad concept of the N. cataria  species, could be considered a chemical \nvariety because distinctive chemical composition. So, this would be the only taxon closely related to N. cataria which could replace M. officinalis, for the purpose of using \nthese drugs in infusion, because their potential action as a sedative, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative.\nFourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy FTIR spectra, that have been successfully used in the of characterization and / or \ndetermination of authenticity in various species and / or chemotypes of medicinal drugs and other plant samples (1, 14, 19, 22, 26), were obtained in this case from each of the extracts of M. officinalis  and N. cataria, determining the areas under the curves of \nspecific vibrational modes, in this case corresponding to the aliphatic high frequency CH and CO stretching modes, one of the tools that can be used to study possible differences among medicinal plants, obtaining the results shown in figures 3-4 and table 3 (page 23); table 4 (page 25).\nFigure 3.

At lower frequencies, in the region corresponding to the CO \nstretching, major differences were observed. The areas under the curves of the CH and CO modes can be used to find interspecific differences.\nIndeed, considering the methanolic extract obtained from both species, the areas \nunder the curve from M. officinalis  (figure 3a, page 22; table 3), showed mean values \nof 82.282 for the mode CO, and 47.297 for the mode CH, whereby the ratio CO/CH varied from 1.634 to 1.825. In turn, N. cataria showed average areal values of 41.999 \nfor the mode CO, and 31.139 for the mode CH, and a CO/CH rate from 1.298 to 1.402.\nAlthough the aqueous extracts also showed different vibrational patterns, is their \narea ratio which allows to differentiate the two species. The areas for the lyophilized aqueous extract of M. officinalis (figure 3b, page 22; table 3) showed values   of 2.238 \nfor CH modes and 11.511 to CO modes, and in this case the CO/CH ratio varied from \n5.939 to 5.487, while the areas recorded for the correspondent extract from N. cataria \n(figure 4b, page 22; table 3) reached 4.222 for CO mode and 0.436   for CH mode, and \nexhibited a CO/CH ratio from 9.269 to 10.162. \nFor both species, there were differences in the CO / CH ratio, which were \nsignificant in reference to the methanolic extract, while lyophilized extracts showed \nhighly significant differences among the two species. This is likely to be directly related to increased water solubility of the compounds present in these drugs.\nAlthough these two species share a number of organic compounds \n(\u03b1-humulene,  \u03b2-elemene, caryophyllene-oxide, cis-ocimene, citral, citronellal, geraniol, \nmyrcene, nerol, rosmarinic acid, thymol, and trans -ocimene), they are more numerous \ndifferentials secondary metabolites (mostly essential oils) that have been reported to date in M. officinalis  (79 compounds) than in N. cataria  (32 compounds) (31). \nThese differences may explain the diverse vibrational stretching values   obtained for \nextracts of both species.

E. Petenatti et al.\nRevista de la Facultad de Ciencias AgrariasTherefore, it can be argued that, even in the case of multi-molecular complexes \nlike this, these specific differences have semi-quantitative relevance. Thus, IR \nspectroscopy may be a useful tool for the characterization of M. officinalis  and \nN. cataria , demonstrating the ability of the method to find additional characters to those \nobtained by other pharmacognostic methods. Moreover, and far as we know, this is the first mention of FTIR data (especially on CO/CH ratio) applied to the identification of specimens of these two medicinal species.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe herbs marketed and/or used in southern South America under the names \n\"Melissa\" or \"Toronjil\" do not always match with the official species, Melissa officinalis  \n(even under its pharmacopoeial name: Melissae folium ).\nThe adulterant (or partial substituent) more frequently found in M. officinalis \ncommercial samples is Nepeta cataria, another Lamiaceae, whose presence is due \nto the morphological affinity, an erroneous harvest, and/or their sometimes coincident \ncommon names.\nAdventitious/cultivated populations of N. cataria  or marketed drug from this \nspecies in Argentina are chemotypes rich in the iridoid nepetalactone. Therefore, the adulteration of M. officinalis  with N. cataria drug used in Argentina can become a high \nhealth risk.\nOnly the N. cataria  chemotype known as \"lemon catnip\" ( N. cataria  var. citriodora ), \nlacks nepetalactone, and because its chemical composition could represent a substituent for M. officinalis.\nAt micrographic level, we report for the first time comprehensive quantitative \nmicrographic parameters of M. officinalis  and N. cataria, far as we know. The decisive \nquantitative parameters to identify each of these drugs are the palisade ratio and the veinlet termination number per mm\n2.\nThe HPLC profiles of both species allow their differentiation through the high content \nof rosmarinic acid in M. officinalis , in comparison to the low amount that shows N. cataria .\nFTIR spectra of both species are reported for the first time, for what we know. \nEven with the limitations of a semiquantitative method, these spectra also contribute to the differentiation among the species, both the vibrational modes as areal values  \nobtained for each in the fingerprint zone.\nThese contributions to the recognition of both species can facilitate the \npharmacognostic quality control both crude drugs (even when the material is finely ground or reduced to powder) and the extracts used in the pharmaceutical industry. An overview of drug diacritical characters between the two species sold in Argentina is displayed in table 4 (page 25).25Micrography, HPLC and FTIR of Melissa  and Nepeta\nTomo 46  \u2022   N\u00b0 2  \u2022   2014Table 4.
