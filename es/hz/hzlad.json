Now, with the president dead and the doctor arrested in Port-au-Prince, Haiti finds itself in familiar territory: on the precipice of a violent upheaval as a [power struggle](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/haiti-assassination-biden-moise-power/2021/07/10/2abf4670-e186-11eb-a27f-8b294930e95b_story.html) plays out between ambitious, ruthless men vying for the nation\u2019s top job.\nThere\u2019s a hidden story here \u2014 one that is rarely discussed when countries such as Haiti keep repeating their tragic cycle of ruthless intrigue and political violence. And it helps explain why countries such as Haiti so often end up with toxic, destructive leaders.\nPower tends to attract corruptible people everywhere. Liberal democracies do sometimes elect Machiavellian narcissists. But their destructive impact is watered down because they\u2019re more constrained by institutions \u2014 and because more incorruptible people are willing to enter the political fray in places where it\u2019s safe to do so.\nThe problem for Haiti isn\u2019t just that it\u2019s a country of broken institutions. It\u2019s also that broken men are often the only ones willing to seek power wherever presidents have a reasonable chance of being killed, exiled or jailed when they lose power. When entering politics becomes physically dangerous, most rational, well-intentioned people exit the political system. It\u2019s too risky. What\u2019s left to fill the vacuum are mostly power-hungry risk-takers. As a result, the only people who still crave power in dangerous political systems are those least suited to wielding it.\nPoor and volatile countries like Haiti therefore find themselves in a catch-22. To fix its broken political system, Haiti needs politicians who are drawn to serve \u2014 but deadly political systems such as Haiti\u2019s mostly attract power-obsessed politicians with an urge to dominate, no matter the consequences.\nThat\u2019s bad news for Haiti\u2019s political future in the aftermath of last week\u2019s assassination. Already, talented Haitians have been prone to avoiding politics. Many even\n[leave the country](https://unctad.org/system/files/non-official-document/ldcr2012-bp1.pdf) in search of better, safer opportunities. As a result, even fewer good potential Haitian leaders will enter the political fray. The country\u2019s chronic brain drain almost certainly just got markedly worse.\nIn the United States, the end of a presidency usually sparks the beginning of a cushy life: designing a presidential library, raking in millions in memoir sales, and a quiet retirement with an occasional diplomatic aid mission to countries (such as Haiti) that suffer terrible natural disasters. The same isn\u2019t true in many countries. As I\u2019ve found in\n[my research](https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/the-despots-accomplice/), becoming president in a poor, volatile country is a dangerous gamble that often ends badly. For example, between 1960 and 2010, more than 4 in 10 presidents in sub-Saharan Africa [exited power](https://www.rochester.edu/college/faculty/hgoemans/data.htm) into exile, in handcuffs or in a casket.\nHolding power in Haiti has always been similarly perilous, with recent presidents being\n[overthrown in coups](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/25/world/haiti-pays-dearly-for-military-coup.html), [forced into exile](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/10/16/aristide-returns-to-acclaim-in-haiti/685e4e3e-918d-4bfb-9d65-6be3db9ead7f/) or, like Mo\u00efse, murdered. In one particularly violent period, Haiti\u2019s leaders met their end \u201cexiled, exiled, bombed and blown up, imprisoned, exiled, executed, exiled,\u201d and, particularly gruesome, \u201cdragged from the French legation by an angry mob and impaled on the iron fence surrounding the legation and torn to pieces.\u201d\nWho looks at that disturbing track record and thinks: \u201cSign me up!\u201d?\nAs I argue in my forthcoming book,\n[\u201cCorruptible: Who Gets Power and How It Changes Us,\u201d](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/corruptible-brian-klaas/1138725807) the unfortunate answer is that a history of political violence targeting leaders causes more ruthless, power-hungry men \u2014 even psychopaths \u2014 to seek power in the future.\nTo want executive power in a country where presidents get\n[gunned down in their homes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/09/probe-into-haitian-presidents-assassination-reaches-beyond-nations-borders/) by mercenaries, you usually need an unquenchable thirst for power, a streak of irrationality or \u2014 most often \u2014 a little bit of both. Psychopaths are perhaps the most likely to pursue such dangerous political jobs, as psychological research [consistently shows](https://europepmc.org/article/med/25433845) that psychopaths rarely believe risks apply to themselves.\nCountries such as Haiti are therefore stuck with a vicious cycle of toxic leadership worsened by political violence. Because it\u2019s dangerous to become president, the potential pool of candidates is narrowed to those who want to rule for the wrong reasons. Then, once in power, even comparatively decent rulers end up clinging to power ruthlessly, because they know that losing power could cost them their life, their livelihood or their freedom. As they overstay their welcome to the dismay of the public or rival factions, they make political violence \u2014 in the form of a coup or assassination \u2014 more likely. The process then repeats itself, getting worse each time.\nUnfortunately, there are no easy answers to breaking that cycle. But for Haiti to move forward, one lesson must be learned: The country will keep repeating its violent history until talented Haitians can believe it is safe to enter the world of politics and public service. Creating that confidence should be a top priority for Haiti\u2019s fragile government \u2014 and the international community \u2014 in the aftermath of last week\u2019s assassination. It will be a herculean task. But to get better leaders, Haiti must make it safe to lead.\nBrian Klaas is an associate professor of global politics at University College London, where he focuses on democracy, authoritarianism, and American politics and foreign policy.
