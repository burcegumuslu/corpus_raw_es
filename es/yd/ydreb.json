After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it.  Incorporating Nutrition Into Your Clinical Practice\nGuidance for the Provider   1-1Good nutrition has always been an important part of good health.  Most people\n                know  a little about nutrition.  Somewhere, most of us have learned about the basic                four food groups.  It is possible that somewhere we have even seen the Food GuidePyramid.  It is more difficult, however, to put specifics on \u201cgood\u201d nutrition.  Mostly goodnutrition means eating the right foods in the right amounts at the right time.  It can be simple.The purpose of this manual is to help make good eating and, thus, good nutrition easy foreveryone.\nOver the past few years it has been increasingly documented that good nutrition is an inte-\ngral part of health care for people with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).  However,very few people really grasp the concept of how to apply even basic food groups to whatthey actually eat.  Therefore, the authors have tried to arrange information from very basic tospecific.  As often as possible, a chart or table is offered instead of lengthy text.  One pageinformation sheets for clients are provided. In addition, materials have been developed withthe recognition that these tools will be used primarily by non-nutritionists in most settings.\nThis manual can assist health care providers and people with HIV in the effort to make good\nnutrition (eating good food) a part of health care.  Specific ideas are presented regarding theissues about eating and food that people with HIV confront on a daily basis.  Health careproviders should monitor changes in body composition and body fat distribution.  Usefulinformation, such as triceps skin fold, midarm and waist circumferences utilizing calipersand a tape measurer, should be routinely collected.  Measurement of body composition usingBioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) is strongly recommended.  If your clinic does nothave access to this equipment, see if someone else in your community does and will performthese measures for your clients.  Several pharmaceutical companies that make products fortreatment of wasting may also help provide the equipment for testing, so ask the companyrepresentatives when they come to visit.  (See Section 8 for more information aboutmeasuring body composition.).\nThe manual is divided into several sections.  There are very simple ideas presented in a\nstraightforward way for those who are not interested in details.  Additional information,scientific references and background information  on many areas of concern in nutrition andHIV are also included.  This information can be used by both providers and clients.\nThe assessment tools provided are to be used, not only for assessing nutritional status, but\nalso as a starting point for counseling.  Routine use of these tools can help assure adequatenutritional care as the client's health status changes throughout the course of the disease.\nThe manual can be used in whole or in parts.  It is the intention of the authors that the\ninformation be simple and easy to use.  It is designed to be updated from time to time andmodified to meet new emerging practices and issues in nutrition.  The following are logosthat can quickly help identify the kind of information found on a page.Introduction\nPurpose\nIntroduction Purpose\nGuidance for the Health Care Provider\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.   After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it.  Incorporating Nutrition Into Your Clinical Practice\nGuidance for the Provider   1-2Role of Nutritional Well-Being\nNutrition is an essential component in the care of HIV-infected individuals.  Almost from\nthe onset, HIV infection causes changes in nutritional status.  During the past decade it hasbecome apparent that individuals at all stages of the HIV disease spectrum are at increasedrisk of nutritional deficiency.  Weight loss, cachexia, loss of lean body mass and specificnutrient deficiencies are commonly seen in HIV-infected individuals.  The cause of malnu-trition is thought to be multifactorial and related to loss of appetite, malabsorption, in-creased losses (vomiting, diarrhea, renal losses, etc.) and alterations in metabolism.\nNutritional needs can be characterized by using \"Levels of Care.\"  Levels of Care are more\nextensively discussed in the HIV/AIDS Medical Nutrition Therapy Protocols in Section 9.\nASYMPTOMATIC HIV INFECTION\nFocus nutrition efforts on:\n\u2756Education about nutritional needs\n\u2756Ensuring adequate diet with balanced intake of macro-nutrients (calories, protein,\ncarbohydrates, fat) and micro-nutrients (vitamins and minerals)\n\u2756Educating clients on safe food handling and preparation\n\u2756Identifying/addressing any misinformation\nHIV/AIDS SYMPTOMATIC BUT STABLE\nFocus nutrition efforts on:\n\u2756Addressing nonspecific symptoms and fatigue\n\u2756Preventing weight loss and potential wasting\n\u2756Exploring use of alternative therapies, herbals, etc.\nAlthough weight loss may occur, it is usually not progressive. Progressive wasting does not\noccur due to a compensation between resting energy expenditure and decreased voluntaryenergy expenditure.\nHIV/AIDS ACUTE AND PALLIATIVE\nFocus nutrition efforts on:\n\u2756Providing adequate calories to diminish effects of malnutrition\nMalnutrition may occur and may be severe and progressive. Clients may have episodic\nperiods of weight loss followed by partial or complete recovery, usually with treatment ofanother disease complication.\nWeight Changes\nRole of Nutritional Well-BeingGuidance for the Health Care Provider\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.   After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it.  Incorporating Nutrition Into Your Clinical Practice\nGuidance for the Provider   1-3With careful attention and early treatment, involuntary weight loss and wasting can be\navoided for most people. This is important because those who lose weight, particularly leanweight (muscle and organ protein), tend to be sicker and may die earlier than others who areable to maintain a healthy weight.\nThere are different patterns of weight change that can be experienced by people with HIV .\nRapid and significant weight loss is what most often comes to mind. However, gradualweight loss or changes in body composition, where fat replaces muscle without noticeableweight loss on the scale, can also occur very early after HIV infection or during the course ofthe disease.\nBody Shape Changes\nAs HIV therapies have improved over the past few years, some people are now beginning togain excess weight as their health returns. Additionally, newer patterns of weight loss andweight change, called \u201clipodystrophy syndrome,\u201d are being observed in patients achievingviral suppression on the highly active antiretroviral therapies- (HAART). These syndromescan cause distress. Some of the characteristics of these fat changes include \u201clipoatrophy,\u201d aloss of fat in the arms, legs, buttocks, and face, that may or may not be accompanied by\naccumulation of visceral fat to the abdomen, or fat to the breasts in women, or back or front\nof the neck.\nThe health significance of these syndromes is not yet clear, but the redistribution of fat to the\nmid-section of the body may be associated with increased risk of other diseases such as heartand gallbladder disease and diabetes. Certainly the changes in physical appearance are verydiscouraging to those who are looking in the mirror, and some may be tempted to stop theirHIV therapy in order to have a normal appearance again. For these reasons, it is important toregularly monitor total weight, body composition, and body weight distribution as a part ofroutine health care for persons living with HIV .\nSome people may lose weight when they do not have access to enough food or when they\neat less to lose weight intentionally. With this kind of starvation weight loss, a person\u2019s bodyuses stored fat first to make up for the energy lacking in the diet, and save protein frommuscles and organs. People with HIV may have this kind of weight loss, and it may be easierto reverse if it is noticed early and something is done to correct it. It is important for healthcare workers to question clients who are involuntarily losing even small amounts of weightto determine why and then work to correct the cause.\nRole of Nutritional Well-BeingGuidance for the Health Care Provider\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.   After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it.  Incorporating Nutrition Into Your Clinical Practice\nGuidance for the Provider   1-4Wasting\nMore serious, however, is weight loss called wasting.  This is when the body uses protein\nfor energy instead of body fat. This condition is important to avoid because our bodyprotein is needed for many critical body functions.\nHIV Wasting Syndrome is an AIDS defining condition.  Wasting is defined by the CDC as\nthe involuntary weight loss of greater than 10 percent of pre-illness body weight, and eitherchronic diarrhea (at least 2 stools per day for more than 30 days) or weakness and docu-mented fever for over 30 days in the absence of a concurrent illness or condition other thanHIV infection.\nCachexia or AIDS Wasting is wasting that goes beyond not goes beyond not getting\nenough to eat. Wasting may be characterized as progressive, unexplainable weight loss inspite of eating well. The key is that your nutrient needs are higher than what you areeating. Because of the virus itself or the complicated way that the anti-HIV medicineschange your metabolism, nutrition needs may be 12-25% higher. Malabsorption, infectionsor other illnesses can increase these needs. Also, the way that your body uses food for fuelmay also be changed. Instead of saving protein for building, repairing and maintainingmuscle, your body may use your own protein stores to use for energy. Cachexia or AIDS\nWasting shows up as a greater weight loss from muscle rather than fat stores. Increased\nloss of muscle over fat is a signal of wasting.\nCauses of weight loss and wasting may be attributed to the following:\u2329Lack of adequate intake:  Lack of appetite can be due to many different reasons,\ndepression, side effects of drugs, pain, mouth sores, difficulty swallowing or otherreasons.  Less than usual intake is a sign that something is wrong and further stepsshould be taken.  Work with your doctor to correct the cause and seek nutrition coun-seling to manage any symptoms and optimize your intake.\n\u2329Hypogonadism: Low levels of testosterone have been seen in both HIV-infected men\nand women. Clinical signs of hypogonadism include: lack of appetite, depression,decreased sexual desire and performance, decreased energy or fatigue, decreasedstrength and endurance, hair loss, impotence, reduced lean tissue, and reduced size oftestes. Testosterone replacement, starting at 100 mg intramuscularly, or use of otheranabolic agents used in conjunction with resistance exercise has been shown to beeffective in weight gain and in the replacement of lean muscle tissue.\n\u2329Loss of nutrients: HIV itself may damage the intestine so that it can not absorb and\nutilize nutrients ingested. This is called malabsorption. V omiting or diarrhea can alsolead to nutrient losses. Use of enteric-coated pancreatic enzymes, special \u201cpre-di-gested\u201d liquid formulas, and glutamine are a few of the treatments that may be helpful.\nRole of Nutritional Well-BeingGuidance for the Health Care Provider\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.   After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it.  Incorporating Nutrition Into Your Clinical Practice\nGuidance for the Provider   1-5Nutrition counseling is helpful for clients with chronic nausea, diarrhea or a specific\nfood intolerance.\n\u2329Increased calorie needs for body processes: The cause of this is not fully understood.\nIt is thought that having HIV constantly present in the body makes it work harder allthe time as it works to get rid of the virus. Nutrition counseling for increased intake ofcalories and other nutrients is the most important therapy in these instances.\n\u2329HIV infection: As with any infection, the body normally releases protein-based im-\nmune factors into the blood to fight infection.  HIV infection continues over an unusu-ally long period of time, and the body keeps needing protein to make the immunefactors.  This eventually interferes with appetite and other normal processes.\n\u2329Other non-HIV infections: In battling infections, caloric and nutrient needs increase.\nWeight loss, fatigue, low-grade fever and anorexia may be early nonspecific signs ofundiagnosed opportunistic infections. The gap between meeting nutrition needs and theamount of calories needed increase as appetite decreases, and this is especially trueduring an opportunistic infection.\nResponse to therapies and nutritional counseling should be initially evaluated at 2 and then\n4 weeks intervals.  It is important to eat good quality food: plenty of complex carbohy-drates with lean, protein foods and moderate amounts of heart healthy dietary fat sources. Itis also important to include some level of progressive resistive exercise to maintain andbuild muscle.\nWith earlier and more effective treatments for both wasting and to stop viral progression,\npeople living with HIV and AIDS are functioning better and living longer.  The hope thatHIV truly becomes a manageable, chronic disease is more real today than ever before.Efforts to identify and prevent excessive weight gain and other complications associatedwith modern health problems, will also be critical to longevity and well being.\nFor more information, see References (Section 11).\nRole of Nutritional Well-BeingGuidance for the Health Care Provider\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

Have client complete a Quick Nutrition Screen (QNS)  while waiting. This is a\ngood opportunity to assess the reading and language ability of your client.\nb.) At a minimum, measure and record height and weight.   Do not ask the client\ntheir height and weight \u2014 measure it.  Collect other useful information such asTricep Skin Fold (TSF) and Midarm Muscle Circumference (MAMC) or Bioelec-trical Impedance Analysis (BIA) as time and equipment permit.  See formulas inthe Tables and Charts (Section 8, pages 8-1 through 8-3) for information on howto do these measurements and calculations.\nc.) Review the completed QNS and evaluate responses with the client.  Make sure\nthat all questions are answered.  Check with the client to be sure that they under-stood and have responded accurately to all of the questions.\nd.) Cue in on \u201cyes\u201d responses to the QNS .  These may indicate potential problem\nareas that need to be addressed.  Ask the client for additional details.  Talk to theclient to determine severity/priority of problems and how they affect their abilityto meet nutritional needs.  Ask the client if there are additional problems/concernsthat are not on the QNS.\nA higher number of yes answers on the QNS\nmay indicate a greater nutritional risk.\ne.)  As a screening tool, the QNS provides basic information; you will need more\ndata.  Use the Nutrition Assessment Tool (NAT) to collect more pertinent,\nspecific information.\nRefer to corresponding client education handouts designed to match the problems\nidentified.  These are located in the client education sections of the manual.\nGetting Started on NutritionGuidance for the Health Care Provider\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.   After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it.  Incorporating Nutrition Into Your Clinical Practice\nGuidance for the Provider   1-9f.)  Pay attention to changes in nutrition problems:  Good nutritional status will help\nthe client feel better.  Let the client know that at each visit they will complete aQNS to further monitor nutritional status.  They need to know that paying attentionto nutritional status will help them feel better. Ask the client to notice changes\nrelated to their diet or health and bring up new problems.   Be positive and be\navailable to give reinforcement to the client. Explain that it is important to bring upany changes that may occur as there may be additional tips or suggestions thatmight be tried to reduce or alleviate symptoms.\ng.)  Be realistic.  In many cases, the client may have multiple problems and it will be\nnecessary to prioritize.  Ask the client his/her priorities. Keep in mind that it maynot be realistic to address all problems at the same visit.\nh.)  Focus on one issue at a time.  Once more data is obtained from the client and\nspecific problems are identified, review and provide handouts from the manualdesigned to match each question number on the QNS.\nWork with the client to identify and implement a plan.\ni.)  Document plans in priority order by including completed QNS in the client\u2019s\nmedical record along with your notes. The Nutrition Assessment Tool (NAT) allowsyou to collect data over several visits. This will allow you to track trends.\n j.)

Ask him/her to write down everything they eat or drink, including allalcoholic beverages and snacks for a 24 hour period.\nd.) If appropriate, ask the client to do one FIR for a day when they work and another for\na day off or weekend day.\ne.) When the client returns with the completed FIR, review serving sizes and food\npreparation.  Ask the client if this is a usual day or if something was unusual aboutthis day.  Use commonly known examples, i.e., a coffee cup size versus a conve-nience store 32 oz. size soda cup.\nf.) Review client intake versus recommendations listed on the bottom of the FIR.\nIdentify areas where the client is not consuming the recommended intake levels.Talk with the client to devise strategies to increase intake in these areas.Guidance for the Health Care Provider\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

If the client reports an intake that exceeds the recommended levels, this is not\nusually a problem.  An exception might be if a client eats excessive amounts offood from only one or two food groups or an excessive amount of fats and/orsweets.  In some cases, the overall goal should be an adequate intake of nutri-ents and calories, as opposed to meeting the recommended number of servingsfrom each food group.\nh.) Look at the overall dietary  pattern.  Remember that physical symptoms (thrush,\nmouth sores, etc.), social issues (lack of money or shelter, etc.), cultural pat-terns, and psychological issues (depression, withdrawal) can dramatically affectfood intake.\ni.) For specific problems, discuss approaches which may be helpful.  Don\u2019t forget\nto use the handouts available in this manual, but don\u2019t use them as a substitutefor discussion.

After all it is your life...enjoy every minute of it.Introduction to Nutrition Assessment\nThe first step in nutritional care is nutritional assessment.  An initial nutritional\n      assessment of the HIV-positive client can provide important baseline information on\n             nutritional status as well as overall health status.  This initial evaluation shouldoccur as early as possible, once the client has been diagnosed as HIV-positive.  This will allow the health care provider to begin to implementdietary interventions or strategies which may help to reduce or alleviatethe nutritional complications associated with HIV-disease and therebyprevent or alter the effects of wasting.  Body measurement of children is addressed inSection 6.  More detailed information about body measurement is located in Section 8.\nA complete nutritional assessment should include the following parameters:\nANTHROPOMETRICS (Body Measurements)\n\u2756Height:  Wall-mounted devices, called stadiometers, are the most accurate way to mea-\nsure height.  If  a stadiometer is not available, a height rod on some scales can be used,though it is less accurate.\n\u2756 Weight:  A variety of weight measures, as well as information about past weight are very\nhelpful...\nCurrent weightWeight history:  usual weight, highest and lowest adult weights and the\ncircumstances to explain these weights\nDesired weight:   healthy weight goal determined at initial visit and revised as\nneeded.  Use weight history and healthy weight (pre-illness, able to easilymaintain without starving or stuffing).\n \u2756Waist, Hip and Neck Circumference Measures:  These measures are used to document\nchanges and trends in body fat distribution.  In general, a waist-hip ratio equal or less than0.8 for women and 1 for men is desirable to maintain.  Measurements greater than thesecan indicate obesity and a greater risk for obesity related diseases.  At this time there is nostandardized technique for measuring neck circumference.\n\u2756Triceps Skinfold and Mid-Upper Arm Circumference:  These measurements are used\nto estimate body muscle and fat stores.  It is important that the clinician taking this mea-surement has been trained and has developed the skills for accuracy.\n\u2756Biochemical Measures: Blood work should also include tests for the following:  test-\nosterone, fasting blood glucose, fasting cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, CD4, viral load,and Hemoglobin A1C (in diabetics).\n\u2756Functional Measures:  The following measures assess changes in functional capacity\nover time.  There are currently no normal ranges to use as a reference.\nIntroduction to Nutrition Assessment   2-2 Assessment Parameters Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

Quick Nutrition Screen (QNS):   This is the place to begin any assessment.  These\n27 questions are related to common nutrition issues that are important to anyonewith HIV .  The client can fill out the questionnaire with or without assistance.Each of the questions is supported by a short \"nutritional screen note\" whichprovides additional information supporting that question. These are designed togive basic support information about why this issue is important to the HIV-positive client's nutritional health. These one page \"Notes\" can also be copied touse as patient education handouts during counseling.\n2. Food Intake Record (FIR):   This form is used to collect a diet history.  The client\nfills out what is eaten on a usual day.  A space is provided for the client and theprovider to evaluate what has been consumed (both food and drink) with a rec-ommended guide for the food groups which is targeted specifically for the indi-vidual with HIV.\n3. Nutrition Assessment Tool (NAT):   This tool can be kept in the client medical\nrecord as a way to keep track of key issues that are related to the nutritionalhealth of an individual.  These are the minimum kinds of data that should betracked at each visit.  Some clinics will have additional clinical information thatthey may record on a regular basis.  This form can be used as is or adapted to theclinic setting.\n4. Food Resources In Your Community:   This worksheet can be used to record the\nvarious kinds of community organizations or agencies where people can get food.It should be filled out, duplicated, and made available to all health care providersand client advocates.\n5. Nutrition Services Screening/Referral Form:  This form is to be used by\nhealthcare providers in referring clients to a Dietitian or other Nutrition Profes-sional (see Section 9-5).\nAssessment ToolsIntroduction to Nutrition Assessment   2-5 Assessment Parameters Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

If you use\n     tobacco, think about cutting back or quitting.  Smoking\n              alters the lung's ability to fight off infection. Smokers oftenget bronchitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis.  Smoking damages therespiratory system and makes it less able to fight infection.  Smokersare also more likely to get a respiratory infection than nonsmokersbecause smoking decreases the T-helper cells and increases the T-suppressor cells.  This alters the helper/suppressor CD4/CD8 ratio inthe lungs which further reduces the ability of the lungs to fight offinfection.  This change may also occur in the blood.  Heavy use ofmarijuana can also produce these changes.  The lungs usually canprevent the deposit of damaging materials on their tissues.  However,smoke inhaled directly into the lungs causes damage to this process.Smoking also decreases the availability of vitamins B-6, B-12, C,and folic acid.  You can get more information about this and find outways to stop smoking by asking your health care provider or casemanager.\nMore reasons to cut out smoking:\n Smoking cuts down on your appetite and how much food you eat.\n    Your caloric and nutrient intake may suffer.\n For some people, smoking triggers an increase in the amounts of\n    coffee and alcohol you drink.\n Smoking harms your taste buds and changes the taste and smell of\n    foods and drinks.\n Smoking greatly increases the risk of heart disease, which has\n    become a new potential complicaton with metabolic changes    (increased blood cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood glucose)    from combination drug therapies.14\nI  smoke cigarettes, cigars, or chew tobacco every day.

Once you are over the initial\n  shock, it is time to decide to take action.  Learn all you can about the disease.  A  good resource is Project Inform.  You can reach them at 1-800-822-7422.\nAsk them for the discussion paper #1,  \"An Overview of HIV and Steps You Can Take.\"\nOne of the things you can do is make choices about what you eat.  What you\neat can make a big difference in the health of your immune system.\nKeep eating, it is good for you!!!  Decide now that you will take control of\nwhat you eat.   Here are some ideas:\n\u2756 The first thing to do is figure out if you are eating what you should.\nWrite down what you eat every day for a few days.Check it against the Food Guide Pyramid.  Be sure most of your choices\n                        are from the bottom of the pyramid.\n\u2756 Okay, so you don\u2019t eat like you should.   Don\u2019t panic.  Most of us feel that we\ndon't eat right.  Decide to make a few changes.  One at a time!\nHere are some ideas:\n1. Keep it simple.   Don\u2019t try to change your eating habits all at once.  Make one change at\na time.  For example, if you do not eat any fruits, choose one you like and eat it every-day, for a week or two.  Then try adding a second fruit, or juice, or nectar.\n2.Eat food that you like.   It is pointless to try to eat stuff that might be healthy, but that\nyou don't  like.  You won't enjoy eating and it will become a chore. This is a quality oflife issue. Don't eat what you don't like.\n3. Be kind to yourself.   Have a treat.  As long as you eat your fruits and veggies, an\noccasional snack of Oreos or other favorite treats won't hurt you.\n4. Always have your favorite foods available.  Find some comfort foods and keep them\non hand. When you feel bad treat yourself.  You deserve to eat what you want.  Becautious about eating favorite foods during times of nausea because you may turnyourself off to them.\n5.Avoid going on special diets that promise miracle cures.  Learn to check stuff out for\nyourself and make decisions that will help keep you healthy. If there is a real cure, whyisn't everyone cured!\n6. If you have a problem with figuring out what to eat, look at pictures in magazines\nand try some of the recipes.

There is no doubt thatliving with HIV is a major stressor.  Getting your head together isa major part of the health assurance plan.\nThere is enough evidence to establish a direct link between stress and changes in the\nimmune system.  Studies have shown that people who experience major stressful lifeevents are unable to fight off disease as well as those people without the excessstresses.\nDepression and despair have been shown to be physically harmful.  In fact, a common\nsymptom of stress is depression.  This can decrease your health status and lead tovarious HIV-related symptoms.  If you are depressed be sure to talk to your primaryhealth care provider about it.  Many people with HIV take medications to help themcope with depression.\nMost of us worry about one thing or another, but we can learn to cope with stress\nbetter.

After all it is your life...enjoy every minute of it.\nHealth Assurance: The Healthy Weight Gain Program\nIf you have lost weight, a reasonable goal is to try to get back to your own\nhealthy weight.  A healthy weight is a weight that you have been at before,where you felt good, strong and had energy, and didn\u2019t have to starve or stuffyourself to stay at that weight.\n\u2756 It is very helpful to have your body composition measured early and routinely in order to\n    know how much of your weight is composed of muscle and organs, and if that weight    changes.  This can be done by Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA).  BIA involves    using a machine that delivers a small amount of electric current (it does not hurt at all!)    that will give an estimate of muscle and fat tissue stores.  Many physicians\u2019 offices and    health care clinics have access to these machines.  Ask your health care provider to    arrange BIA testing for you.\n\u2756 What did you weigh when you felt your best?  Maintaining your own healthy weight is\n    more important than being at the exact \u201cIdeal Weight\u201d for your height that are listed on    charts.\n\u2756 If you have always been very thin, you will probably never be a big person, but you may\n    be able to gain extra pounds of \u201cinsurance\u201d of both muscle and body fat.\n\u2756 If you have lost weight, it is very important to work closely with your health care provider\n    and Registered Dietitian or other Nutrition Professional.  They will try to find out what is    causing you to lose weight, ways to stop the weight loss and ways to regain weight the    right way.\nFoods or supplements to help increase your intake of calories and nutrients include:\u2756 Home-made high calorie, high protein shakes\n\u2756 Commercial nutritional supplements (e.g., Carnation Instant Breakfast\u00ae, Benefit\u00ae,\n    Ensure\u00ae, Scandishake\u00ae, Boost High Protein\u00ae, NuBasics\u00ae)\n\u2756 Pack more calories into your favorite foods by adding additional ingredients (e.g.,\n    powdered milk, potato flakes, cheese, etc.)\nSome of the treatments shown to be helpful in gaining weight include:\u2756 Appetite stimulant medications like Megace\u00ae or Marinol\u00ae to improve appetite.  In some\n    states medical marijuana is available and may be helpful.\nWeight Gain ProgramNutrition: When You Are Positive\nHealth Assurance  3-4 Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

The\nbenefits of exercise include:\n\u2756 Increased strength and endurance\n\u2756 Increased lung capacity\n\u2756 Increased lean body mass (i.e. muscles)\n\u2756 Decreased stress\n\u2756 Improved sleeping patterns\n\u2756 Improved appetite\n\u2756 Improved bowel habits\n\u2756 Improved self esteem\nMuch has been written about the importance of maintaining your weight if you are\nHIV-positive.  But, recently, scientists have learned that building muscles is necessaryto maintain good health and actually helps to strengthen the immune system.\nBefore starting an exercise program, talk to your doctor or health care provider.  Once\nthey approve your exercise plans, the key points to remember when starting an exer-cise program are:\n\u2756 You don\u2019t need to join a spa or a gym to exercise effectively.\n\u2756 In order to tone and condition different muscle groups, try different types of\n    moderate exercises such as climbing stairs, walking, lifting weights, etc.\u2756 Don\u2019t do strenuous exercise like long distance running, cycling, etc.-- especially\n    if you aren\u2019t used to it.  Immunity can be decreased by heavy exercise and make    you more prone to infection.  If you overdo it when exercising you might get    sick, no matter what kind of shape you\u2019re in.\u2756 Start slowly (10-15 minutes every other day is a good way to start).\n\u2756 Increase the length of time that you exercise slowly until you can exercise\nabout 45 minutes a day, emphasize adding muscle mass.\n\u2756 Always warm up prior to and cool down after exercising (i.e. stretch and range\n    of motion).\u2756 Be sure to eat enough food and drink plenty of water when you exercise.\n    Exercise burns calories and you must eat and drink enough to replace the calories    ad fluids used during exercise.  If you don\u2019t have enough calories and fluids, you    can weaken your immune system.\u2756 Make a practice of resting when your energy levels become low.\n\u2756 Think about how you feel when you finish exercising.  You should feel a little\n    tired, but refreshed.  If you feel bad in any way, talk to your health care provider.Nutrition: When You Are Positive\nHealth Assurance  3-6 Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

They can help you set up a plan that meets your needs. Also, they can help    monitor your progress so that you can reach your exercise goals.\nAnaerobic exercises  are also called resistance or strength training exercises.\n\u2756 Anaerobic exercises usually involve pushing or pulling something heavy using\n    relatively short bursts of energy.\u2756 This type of exercise helps to increase the size and strength of muscle.\n\u2756 Try to include 2 sessions of anaerobic exercises per week with at least 2 days of rest\n    between each session.\u2756 Try to include in each session 1-3 exercises for each of the major muscle groups: legs,\n    back, shoulder, arms, and the abdominal area.\u2756 Use enough resistance with dumbbells, exercise bands or your own body weight to\n    tire the muscles within 8-12 repetitions of the exercise movement.

Bicycling, climbing stairs, and jumping rope are also good aerobicexercises.\n\u2756 This type of exercise helps to improve heart and\nlung function, increases insulin sensitivity, anddecreases body fat.\n\u2756 It is important to combine both anaerobic and\naerobic exercise for a complete workout plan.\nSample Exercise Routine\nWarm-Up - Perform light exercise, like walking,\nto prepare the body for exercising harder.\nStretch - To improve range of motion in your joints, prepare muscles and joints for strenu-\nous exercise, and reduce risk of muscle strains and joint sprains.\nAerobic Exercise - Perform an activity that involves the legs (walking, jogging, biking, etc.)\nfor 20, 30, 40 minutes or longer without running out of breath.  Your heart rate andbreathing rate should increase, but you should still be able to have a conversation.\nResistance Exercise - Use dumbells, exercise bands, water bottles filled with sand, or the\nweight of your own body to exercise the seven major muscle groups:\n1.  Legs - stair climbing, squats, leg\nextensions, leg curls\n2.  Chest - pushups, bench press3.  Back - pulldowns, rowing4.  Shoulders - arm raises, military press\n5.  Biceps - curls6.  Triceps - extensions7.  Abdominals - crunches\nCool-Down -  Perform light exercise, like walking, to bring your heart rate down and cool\nthe body.\nStretch Again -  To keep muscles and joints limber, and reduce muscle soreness.\nDrink adequate fluids -  Drink approximately 4 - 8 ounces every 15 minutes.  Drink an extra\n16 ounces of fluid for every pound of weight lost after exercising.Listen to your body!!\nDon\u2019t push yourself too hard.Relax, breathe, and enjoy yourself.Remember to drink plenty of fluidsbefore, during & after exercise.Pay attention to how you feel whenyou finish exercising.  You may haveto decrease the amount of time ornumber of repetitions if you are verytired.

How\n ever,  if  you are overweight and want to shed a few pounds here are some ideas to try:\n\u2756Limit fat in your diet!  Cut down on, or don't eat fried foods, baked goods or pro-\ncessed meats (like bologna, hot dogs, bacon or sausage).\n\u2756If fried foods are the only ones that are available, try to eat as little of the fat as\npossible. For example, take the skin off of chicken before you eat it, remove thecoating off fried fish, and cut visible fat off of any meat.\n\u2756Use smaller amounts of butter or margarine and mayonnaise.  These are pure fat.\nThere is no difference in the fat calories between butter and margarine. Some ofthese condiments are available in lower or non-fat forms.\n\u2756Limit snacks, particularly those that are higher in fat like potato chips, corn chips,\ntortilla  chips, etc.  Anything that has been fried will have fat.  Try snacks likepretzels or air-popped popcorn.\n\u2756If you use dairy products, choose those that have less fat.  For example, drink\nnonfat (skim) or 1% milk, look for lower fat or nonfat cheeses, and low-fat ornonfat yogurt and cottage cheese.  Choose broth-based soups rather than soups thatare cream-based.\n\u2756Limit empty caloried snack foods such as soda, kool-aids/fruit drinks, chocolate,\nother candies, cookies and snack foods high in sugar and calories.\n\u2756Increase activity.  Do more walking, or climb up steps instead of riding the elevator.\nIf you drive, park away from where you are going.  Walk around your house more.The more you move your body, the more calories you will use up.\n\u2756Muscle building exercises will help prevent wasting. If you don't have free weights\nWanting to Lose WeightHealth Assurance: What if You Want to Lose Weight\ntry using bricks, canned goods, plastic bottles filled with water, or\nother items.\nSummary\nGoing on a weight loss diet is risky for people who are HIV-positive.  If you do decide you want to lose weight, be smart.Do not go on any diet that uses liquids as a substitute formeals.  Check out any diet  you might consider with yourhealth care provider.

Therapies which many consider alternatives or supplements totraditional treatment include vitamin-mineral supplementation, exercise, special diets,herbs, cleansing and massage therapies, acupuncture, etc. Some of these therapies such asantioxidant vitamins and exercise have been shown in clinical research to have a benefi-cial effect on the immune system.\nSome alternative treatments have been tested and shown to be toxic. Many other therapies\nhave not been tested and little is known about the effects, if any, on our health. Even lessis known about how these untested treatments interact with HIV disease and some of themedications commonly taken by HIV-positive people.\nOne special area of concern is that some therapies are very expensive. You must weigh the\nbenefit of the treatment against the cost. Remember that a lot of people, with a profitmotive, will take advantage of others who are looking for a cure or better treatment resultsand see only an opportunity to make money. Therefore, all the \u201cclaims\u201d made about whatproduct or therapy will help are not always true, which makes it even harder for you todecide what is best.\nSeveral therapies which look like they have a good chance to help persons with HIV\ndisease are being tested in HIV clinical trials. A clinical trial is the way researchers studythe benefits and risks of using a new treatment for a disease in people. When a product istested in a clinical trial, scientists try to answer the following questions:\n\u2756  Does it cause harm?\n\u2756  Will it help?\n\u2756  How much does it cost?\n\u2756  Can you afford it?\nIf you want to get more specific clinical trials information on a therapy that you are\nconsidering, you can call one of these numbers.

Vitamins and minerals are involved in specific                reactions in your body and need to be taken with food  because they must\ninteract with protein, fat and carbohydrates in order to be effective.\nHealthy people who eat a variety of food every day usually do not need to take a\nmultivitamin and mineral supplement because they meet their requirements from thefoods they eat. If you are HIV-positive, you need more than what food provides .\nThis is especially true if you have a poor appetite, skip meals, if your body is fightingoff infections, or if you have nausea/vomiting or chronic diarrhea.\nSpecific vitamin and mineral deficiencies can add to a depressed immune system and\nmay be associated with not eating enough calories and protein.\nIf you are HIV-positive, you would benefit from taking two multivitamin and mineral\nsupplement pills daily with food spaced throughout the day. Take a multivitamin\nand mineral supplement daily that is at least 100% of the U.S. Reference Dietary Intake(RDI).  The RDI is a nutritional standard set by the government for levels people needin order to prevent deficiencies and to maintain health.\nDo not take too much .  Check the contents to make sure that you do not take very high\ndosages that can cause side effects. Remember, your body can only use a certainamount at a time.  Taking high doses all at once can be expensive and wasterful sincethe body can\u2019t use them and they will be excreted. In addition, if you take too much ofsome vitamins, you can depress you immune system further.\nAs HIV disease progresses, research has shown that you can become deficient in\ncertain vitamins and minerals; for example vitamin B-12, folate, vitamin B-6, zinc andselenium.  Growing evidence suggests that therapeutic doses of beta-carotene, vitaminE and vitamin C may act as antioxidants to reduce the level of free radicals producedby HIV infection.\nSee Section 10 for more information on doses of vitamins and\nminerals.Nutrition: When You Are Positive\nHealth Assurance  3-11 Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

They are useful when you are not feeling well, don\u2019t feel like           eating, or really need to gain extra weight.  Ideally, these items are used as an addedboost to your regular meals or between meals as a snack. Try to not let these productsreplace a meal.  However, if you just cannot eat for some reason, a supplement is muchbetter than eating nothing.  Often, liquid is easier to take than solids.\n\u2756 Cans and bars can be very easy to take along with you on the go to make sure you have\n    your needed snack when time runs short.\n\u2756 Supplements in powder form can be mixed with a variety of liquids or easily added into\n    foods.\n\u2756 Your Registered Dietitian, other Nutrition Professional, or health care provider can help\n    you decide if supplements like these would be good for you and help you choose one.\n\u2756 Check to see if your insurance or Medicaid will assist with the cost.\nThe following is a list of companies that make nutritional supplements, their toll free phone num-\nbers, and some of the products that they make:\nNESTLE CLINICAL  NUTRITION\n1-800-422-2752 Nu Basic 1.0, Nu Basic 1.5, Nu Basicwww.nestleclinicalnutrition.com 2.0, Nu Basic Soups, Nu Basic Bars;\nPeptimen VHP\nMEAD JOHNSON\n1-800-457-3550 Boost, Boost Plus, High Protein Boostwww.meadjohnson.com Pudding, Boost with Fiber, Lipisorb\nNOV ARTIS NUTRITION\n1-800-333-3785 Impact Recover, Resource Plus, Resource,www.novartisnutrition.com Peptinex\nROSS LABS\n1-800-227-5767 Ensure, Ensure Plus, Ensure Pudding,www.rosslabs.com Ensure with Fiber, Advera, OptimentalHealth Assurance: Using Caloric Supplements\nUsing Food SupplementsNutrition: When You Are Positive\nHealth Assurance  3-12 Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

People living with\nHIV disease often have the same kinds of illnesses and need the same kinds of medicinesas people without HIV infection.  However HIV-positive people may get unusualinfections called \u201copportunistic infections\u201d.  Opportunistic infections (often abbreviated\u201cOI\u201d) are caused by microorganisms that are usually harmless to people with a healthyimmune system.  However for those with a damaged immune system, thesemicroorganisms use \u201cthe opportunity\u201d to produce illness.  People are at greater risk ofopportunistic infections when their T-cells are low, their viral load is high, or they are\nmalnourished.  Some medicines are taken as a prophylaxis, that is, to protect against\ngetting a disease or opportunistic infection.\nTypes of medications commonly prescribed for HIV , include:\n\u2756Antiretrovirals that prevent the virus from reproducing or \u201creplicating.\u201d  These newly\n    developed drugs are classified as protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse    transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptases inhibitors    (NNRTIs), and others are in development.\n\u2756Medicines that treat opportunistic infections and prophylactic medicines that prevent\n    opportunistic infections.\n\u2756Medications that treat the symptoms of HIV infection, opportunistic infections, and\n    side effects of other medications.\n\u2756Appetite stimulants and medications to help build lean body mass.  Some of these were\n    discussed earlier.\n\u2756A list of many of the drugs used in the treatment of HIV and their side effect/\n    nutritional complications can be found in the tables and charts at the end of Section 8.\nCommon MedicationsNutrition: When You Are Positive\nHealth Assurance  3-13 Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

More women suffer from anemia than men.  Signs of                   anemia may include paleness, fatigue, apathy, poor concentration, head-aches, poor body temperature regulation, shortness of breath and palpitations of theheart.  It can have many causes, including infections and inflammation, kidney dis-ease, side-effects of drug therapies, faulty use of the nutrients within the body orincreased nutrient requirements for zinc, selenium, vitamin B-12, folic acid, copper,vitamin C or protein.  Anyone experiencing these symptoms described above shouldconsult their health care provider to determine if they are suffering from anemia andwhat type of anemia it is.  Do not take supplemental iron if you suspect anemia, checkwith your health care provider about your own iron requirements. It is possible to gettoo much iron.\nAnemiaGood dietary sources are:\n\u2756 Iron: Liver, poultry, meat, fish, iron-fortified cereals, dried apricots, soy-\nbeans and spinach.  Cooking in cast iron pots and skillets will increase theiron in your diet.\n\u2756 Folic Acid : Liver, beans, green leafy vegetables and fortified cereals.\n\u2756 Copper : Oysters, clams, sesame and sunflower seeds, soybeans, garbanzo\nbeans, tofu, almonds and tomato sauce.\n\u2756 Vitamin C : Bell pepper, citrus fruits and juices (orange, grapefruit, tanger-\nine), kiwi fruit, brussel sprouts, strawberries, broccoli, greens, cantaloupeand cabbage.\n\u2756 Protein : All types of meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy, cooked dried beans,\nnuts and tofu.Nutrition: When You Are Positive\nHealth Assurance  3-14 Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

While the causes are not yet understood and the condition is                   not well defined, some people have experienced a condition that has be-come known as the \u201clipodystrophy syndrome.\u201d  Technically \u201clipodystrophy\u201d meansany problem in the processing of fat.  In HIV disease, lipodystrophy syndrome refers tochanges in how fat is distributed in the body and changes in ways fats and sugars areprocessed (metabolized) in the body.   Not all the changes need to occur at one time.\nLipodystrophy syndrome is thought possibly to be due to changes of certain hormones\nthat are found in the body or just living longer with a lower viral load.  Lipodystrophysyndrome has been found to occur in various degrees when taking protease inhibitorsand non-nucleoside reverse transcriptases.  It seems that aspects of lipodystrophysyndrome may be effected by particular medication, time on the drug, lowest CD4levels, gender, age, and pre-therapy weight.  It seems likely to be more than one syn-drome.  There are many studies underway and researchers agree that the threat to lifeand quality of life is far greater without HIV medications, than with them.\n1.  Lipodystrophy syndrome may include fat distribution changes:\u2756A person may gain a large amount of fat weight around the organs in their belly.\n   This has been referred to as protease paunch, or abdominal, visceral, central ortruncal   fat or obesity.\u2756Fat may be lost from the face, arms, legs and buttocks.  Cheeks may appear sunken,\n   and muscles and veins may be more easily seen.  This fat loss is from the fat found   underneath the skin.  This kind of fat is called subcutaneous fat.\u2756Fat may build up on the back of shoulders and neck (buffalo hump), or little bumps\n   can occur under the skin anywhere on the body.\u2756Women seem to experience greater fat gain in breasts and the abdomen than men.\n   Men seem to lose more fat under the skin.\nSince it is not known exactly why these changes are happening, there are no proven\n\u201ccures\u201d for \u201clipodystrophy syndrome\u201d at this time. However, some things that mayhelp include:\n\u2756Be aware of your body and report any body shape changes to your primary care\n   provider.\nChronic DiseaseNutrition: When You Are Positive\nHealth Assurance  3-16 Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

Good sources of protein that\n   are low in fat include: low-fat milk and dairy products, lean meats, chicken, fish,   cooked beans, tofu, nuts and seeds.\u2756Speak to a Registered Dietitian to get ideas on how to make healthier food choices.\n\u2756Talk to your health care provider about exercises that are right for you. In general,\n   aerobic exercises tend to burn fat, and anaerobic exercises build muscle.  See Section   3 for exercise tips.\u2756Have your testosterone, cholesterol, triglycerides and blood sugar checked regularly.\n   Write these numbers down so that you keep track of them too.\u2756Don\u2019t stop your medicines. Talk to your health care provider. Maybe there is another\n   combination of medicines that will be better for you.\n2. Lipodystrophy Syndrome may include changes in how sugar and\nfats are processed (metabolized) in the body and seen as changesin some laboratory levels:\nBlood lipid levels (lipid means fat)\n\u2756Increase in total cholesterol\n\u2756Increase in LDL-cholesterol (LDL = low density lipoprotein, often called the \u201cbad\u201d\n   cholesterol)\u2756Decrease in HDL-cholesterol (HDL = high density lipoprotein, often called the\n   \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol)\u2756Increase in VLDL-cholesterol (VLDL = very low density lipoprotein)\n\u2756Increase in triglycerides\nBlood glucose levels (glucose means sugar):\n\u2756Increase in insulin resistance (decrease in insulin sensitivity)\n\u2756Increase in blood glucose levels\nWhy is this a problem?\nThe possibility of coronary artery disease becomes greater when there is a problemwith blood sugar levels.  Plus, blood sugar problems can make blood lipid levelsworse, and abnormal blood lipid levels are major risk factors for coronary heart dis-\nease.  Increased blood sugar levels, high triglyceride levels, low cholesterol-HDL,obesity - especially with greater amounts of fat around the middle, high blood pressure,lack of exercise and smoking, all increase the risk of heart disease.\nChronic DiseaseNutrition: When You Are Positive\nHealth Assurance  3-17 Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

Cholesterol and triglycerides are blood\n             lipids. Many people taking combination therapies may develop high, even veryhigh, blood lipid levels. Have a fasting blood lipid profile lab test taken every 3-6months.  A high lipid level over time can lead to an increased risk of heart disease orpancreatitis (an inflamed pancreas). Men have abnormal blood fats more often thanwomen do.\n What is cholesterol?\nCholesterol is a fatty wax-like substance that is made by your liver and comes fromcertain foods as well. It is needed by your body for energy to make hormones and toprotect your nerve and brain tissue. However, too much cholesterol in your blood is arisk factor for heart disease. It is only found in foods that come from an animal. Plantbased foods such as fruits, vegetables, and grains do not have cholesterol in them.Cholesterol found in animal fat is not the only problem.  Too much saturated andhydrogenated fats in the diet increase cholesterol made in the body and will increaseblood cholesterol levels.\nWhat makes your blood cholesterol levels become high?\n        \u2756  Some of your medicines can increase your cholesterol\n        \u2756  Your liver is making too much cholesterol\n        \u2756  You may be eating foods that are high in cholesterol and/or high in fat,\n              especially saturated fat.\nWhat does the cholesterol test measure?\nThe blood cholesterol test measures your total cholesterol. The total cholesterol may bethe first step in screening you for high cholesterol. Your health care provider may orderanother blood test based on your total cholesterol results. This is called a lipid profile.Health Assurance:  Chronic Disease\nChanges in Blood Lipid Profiles\nChronic DiseaseNutrition: When You Are Positive\nHealth Assurance  3-18 Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.  After all it is your life...enjoy every minute of it.If a lipid profile is needed, it should be done when you are fasting.  This means you\n      will need to not eat for at least twelve hours before the test. The lipid profile\n      measures:\n\u2756Total cholesterol\n    Total cholesterol is the sum of your HDL, LDL and one-fifth your triglyceride level.    A normal cholesterol level is between 120 and 200 mg/dl.\u2756HDL-cholesterol (High-Density Lipoprotein)\n    HDL is also known as the \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol. HDL\u2019 s help to pick up the \u201cbad\u201d\n    cholesterol in your blood vessels and remove it from your blood stream. HDL\u2019s do    not clog the arteries. Good HDL levels are 50-60 for women and 40-50 for men.\u2756LDL-cholesterol (Low-Density Lipoprotein)\n    LDL-cholesterol is also known as the \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol. LDL\u2019 s cause the cholesterol\n    to stick to your blood vessels, which can clog your arteries.  LDL should measure    below 130 mg/dl.\u2756Triglycerides\n    Triglycerides represent the bulk of ingested fats. Triglyceride\n    above 250 mg/dl are considered high and may have a role in forming plaque in the    arteries.\nAsk your health care provider what your levels are and write them down.What can you do to help improve your cholesterol numbers?\u2756Take steps to improve your diet, increase the amount you exercise, and possibly take\n    cholesterol lowering medication.\u2756Reduce total amount of fat eaten per day. Reduce from your diet added fat -- rich\n   gravies, sauces, mayonnaise, and desserts. Stop frying and instead bake, steam, boil,   broil or barbecue.\u2756Use less \u201cbad\u201d fats such as lard, butter, stick margarine, whole milk products, and\n   coconut.  Use \u201chealthy\u201d fats such as olive and canola oils, lowfat dairy products, and   soft margarine.  Remember you still need to eat less fat all together.\u2756Eat lean cuts of meat, chicken without the skin, and fish.\n\u2756Add fiber to your diet, such as whole wheat breads and cereals, grains, beans,\n   oatmeal, and oat bran, and fruits and vegetables.\u2756Begin an exercise program.

Your medicines, past or current use of alcohol, or too much fat or sugar in yourdiet can cause a high triglyceride level.\nWhy should I care about triglycerides?A high triglyceride level can also increase your risk of developing heart disease. Very\nhigh triglyceride levels can also cause pancreatitis. Normally triglyceride levels shouldbe between 35-135 mg/dl for women and 40-160 mg/dl for men.  If your triglyceridelevel is above 500 mg/dl for more than 6 months you may need medicine to lower it.\nHow do you lower triglycerides?Your triglyceride level may stay high even if you are eating healthy and exercising\nwell.  Even if you are taking medicine to help lower them, you should reduce some ofthe foods in your diet that could cause increased triglyceride levels such as:\n\u2756Sugars.  Limit amounts of honey, hard candies, soda, jelly beans, white table sugar,\n   syrups and other sweet treats.\u2756Try sugar substitute s such as Nutrasweet or Equal (blue packets) or Sweet-n-Low\n   (pink packets), or Splenda (yellow packets).\u2756Use diet soft drinks and diet drink mixes.\n\u2756Alcohol.

Some people may develop diabetes, high blood sugar\n             levels that must be controlled. Blood sugar is also called blood glucose.\nWhat is insulin resistance?Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body does not respond to insulin.  Insulin\nis a hormone that normally lowers the amount of sugar in the blood by stimulating theuse of glucose in the muscle and fat, and by decreasing how much glucose is producedin the liver. Insulin resistance is difficult to determine outside of research or specialstudies, so you will need to track quarterly fasting blood sugar levels closely.\nWhy is this a problem?Insulin resistance is a common reason for the development of type 2 diabetes.  Both\nimpaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes are risk factors for heart disease as wellas other problems, such as kidney disease, retinopathy and neuropathy. High lipidlevels and having high blood pressure worsens the risk of heart disease, as do other riskfactors: obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and belonging to certain ethnic groups (NativeAmericans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, African Americans).\nWhat lab values are important to watch?Fasting blood glucose levels less than 110 are considered normal.  Fasting blood\nglucose levels between 110 to 126 indicate a risk factor for the development of type 2diabetes.  Fasting blood sugars within this range may indicate that you are not usingglucose well, and if that is the case, it is called \u201cimpaired glucose tolerance.\u201d  A level ator above 126 may indicate a diagnosis of diabetes and require further tests.  If you havediabetes, another very helpful lab test is gylcosylated hemoglobin, which is abbreviatedto HbA1c, and pronounced hemoglobin-A-one-C. Normal levels of HbA1c are be-tween 4-6% and keeping HbA1c levels to below 7.2% greatly reduces risks of compli-cations.  You may also be taught how to monitor your blood glucose at home.  Self-monitoring can give you greater ability to control daily blood glucose levels.Health Assurance:  Chronic Disease\nChanges in Blood Sugar Levels\nChronic DiseaseNutrition: When You Are Positive\nHealth Assurance  3-22 Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

These remain in your                     blood and may make you feel ill. You may need to eat fewer foods thatmake these waste products so your kidneys will not have to work as hard.\nSome nutrients important to people with kidney problems include:\u2756Calories  -Calories ultimately come from the protein, carbohydrate and fat found in\n   foods. It is important to eat the right amount of calories to give you energy and help   maintain a healthy weight.  If extra calories are needed talk with your Reigistered   Dietitian or Nutritionist about nutritional supplement drinks designed for people with   kidney dysfunction.\u2756Fluids - Your health care provider may want you to limit fluid intake.\n\u2756Protein  - Protein comes from both animal (meats, eggs, fish, poultry, dairy) and plant\n   (beans, peas, tofu, and nuts) sources. The amount of protein that you should have   daily needs to be calculated just for you. If you eat too much protein you may have   problems with fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite. If you eat too little protein you   can lose muscle.\u2756Potassium  - is found in many foods. High amounts of potassium are found in some\n   fruits, vegetables, and cooked beans, nuts and in some salt substitutes. Eating too   much or too little potassium can cause weakness in your muscles and can affect your   heart. Your health care provider may want you to reduce high potassium foods like:   baked potato, hash browns, potato chips, cooked spinach, sweet potato, tomato paste,   winter squash, banana, prunes, and bamboo shoots.\u2756Sodium  - is found mainly in table salt and in processed or convenience foods. You\n   need to limit your sodium intake to help control thirst and blood pressure.\u2756Phosphorus  - comes from foods like meats, milk and other animal products. Some\n   plant foods also have phosphorus. The kidneys help control the amount of   phosphorus in your body and kidney problems can make the level of phosphorus   change in your body. Too much or too little can cause your bones to become weak   and break. Your health care provider may want you to reduce high phosphorus foods   like: dairy products, waffles, pancakes, green peas, snow peas, corn, asparagus,   brussel sprouts, rutabagas, parsnips, cooked spinach, soda, organ meats, and sardines.\nYour Registered Dietitian or other Nutrition Professional can help make sure that you\nget the right balance of these nutrients by helping you come up with a meal plan thatbalances these nutrients for your special needs, and by making sure that you getenough calories to maintain your weight.Health Assurance:  Chronic Disease\nWhen Your Kidneys Aren\u2019t Working Well\nChronic DiseaseNutrition: When You Are Positive\nHealth Assurance  3-26 Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

Eating healthy food is especially important when\n               you are HIV-positive in order to increase your physical strength so that you\ncan live life to its fullest. Good nutrition is a co-therapy that can help to maximize\nyour medical management of HIV disease. Aggressive nutrition can prevent or delay\nthe loss of your muscle tissue, a process that is also called the HIV Wasting Syndrome.\nResearch indicates that your nutritional health is a major factor influencing HIV , wellness, and\nsurvival. Currently, there is no cure for HIV disease or AIDS, but you can affect the disease\nprocess and improve the quality of your life by maintaining a positive attitude and a\nhealthy lifestyle. Some healthy lifestyle changes you can make include:\n\u2756  Work with your health care provider to design an effective medicine routine that you can\n     live with.\n\u2756  Do not skip your medicines since this can make your body not use them as well.\n\u2756  Eat healthy foods.  Healthy does not mean expensive.\n\u2756  Deal with stress in positive ways. Learn how to manage stress.\n\u2756  Get regular exercise.\n\u2756  Talk with your health care provider about using appropriate natural or complementary\n     therapies as part of your personal health plan.\n\u2756  Cut down or stop \"unhealthy\" behaviors like smoking, drinking alcohol, and using street or\n     other drugs.\n\u2756  Learn as much as you can about HIV and keeping yourself healthy.\nThese therapies can work together and potentiate each other, to help you fight HIV .\nPeople with HIV/AIDS tend to lose muscle tissue and protein stores with varying amounts of\nfat loss. There are three  major reasons why you may lose weight, experience muscle wasting\nand develop HIV-related malnutrition. If you have a poor appetite , you may not eat enough\nprotein, calories, vitamins and minerals that your body needs.  Your body\u2019s metabolism\nspeeds up during active infection so you need extra calories and protein from food to maintain\nyour weight; and malabsorption , like chronic diarrhea, which causes your body's loss of\ncalories, protein, vitamins and minerals.\nA major nutritional goal for HIV disease is to build or maintain your muscle weight. You\ncan do this by eating food and drinking fluids that are high in calories so that your body\ndoesn't overuse and waste good muscle tissue for energy. These types of food give your body\nenergy: starches or complex carbohydrates, simple sugars and fats. You also need food that\nprovides your body with protein to build and maintain that critical muscle mass. Regular and\nrepetitive weight resistance exercise will help you gain muscle strength. You can choose a\ncombination of animal or complemented vegetable protein sources depending on your prefer-\nence.NUTRITIONNUTRITION\nNutrition Guidance  4-2It is very important to eat small amounts of food throughout the day, even if you're not hun-\ngry. A high protein, high calorie eating plan that is rich in starches, complex carbohy-\ndrates, and includes moderate amounts of fat is best for you to help prevent muscle\nwasting with HIV disease. This may change if you have specific symptoms or other existing\nmedical problems. Your Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist can help you decide how to modify\nyour eating plan if you have specific symptoms. This guide offers eating tips for maximizing\nyour protein and energy intake to gain quality weight. It includes guidelines for taking vitamin\nand mineral supplements, suggestions for managing nutrition problems that may interfere with\nyour ability to eat, and basic food safety tips and recipes.

A calorie is a way of measuring\n                     the energy that food supplies. It is good to eat a lot of high energy food like\ncomplex carbohydrates or starches, a food category  that includes whole grain breads and\ncereals, pasta, potatoes and rice. Fruits, vegetables and simple sugars also give your body\nquick energy.  Fats give you extra energy to burn and build body fat. If you don't eat enough\ncalories from carbohydrates, your body will break down your muscles for energy. You may\nnot have an appetite if you become sick; you may notice that you are gradually losing weight.\nThis represents an \"emergency\" situation; call your Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist right\naway.\nTo increase your calorie intake:\n\u2756Eat six small meals throughout the day.\n\u2756Keep snacks that don't require refrigeration near your bed or by the television.\n\u2756Pack non-perishable food to snack on when you are away from home.\n\u2756Engage in light exercise before you eat to increase your appetite.\nComplex starches or carbohydrates are the best type of energy to build and maintain\nyour muscle tissue. Eat generous portions of: Pasta, (whole wheat or enriched macaroni,\nspaghetti or noodles), rice (brown or white), barley, millet, tabouli and couscous. Also chooseoatmeal, cream of wheat, rice cereal, corn meal, grits and cold cereals. In addition, breads,tortillas, muffins, biscuits, crackers, dumplings, pancakes and waffles are good. And potatoes,yams, plantain, yuca, breadfruit, corn, green peas and lima beans offer special phytochemicalsas do cooked kidney beans, navy beans, lentils, pinto beans, black-eyed peas, and chickpeas.\nSimple sugars give you extra energy to gain muscle and also fat weight. For extra en-\nergy,  snack on fresh or dried fruit (raisins, dates, apricots, pineapple, papaya and prunes). Add\njelly, jam, honey and maple syrup to hot and cold cereal, pancakes and waffles. Add honey,sugar, molasses or flavored syrup to milkshakes. Top ice cream, frozen or regular yogurt withfresh or dried fruit and syrup. Snack on cakes, pies, cookies and candy between meals.  Don'tlet simple sugars replace more important protein and nutrient rich foods.  If your blood sugarshave been high or you have diabetes, adding simple sugars to your diet, such as table sugar,honey, syrup, sodas and a lot of fruit juice, are not a good source of calories.  Check with yourhealth care provider and Registered Dietitian or Nurtitionist for instructions.NUTRITIONNUTRITION\nNutrition Guidance  4-4Fats give you extra energy to gain and maintain weight. If you can tolerate fat, eat moder-\nate amounts. Add butter, margarine, sour cream, cream cheese or peanut butter to sandwiches,crackers, pancakes, waffles and hot cereal.

Top salads with avocado, olives and extra salad dressing. If you are notlactose intolerant, add non-fat dry milk solids, condensed milk, evaporated milk, whole milkor cream to granola and hot and cold cereals. If you can't tolerate milk, some companies offerno or low-lactose fluid or dry \"milk\", usually from soy, a powerful phytochemical.

The type and severity of diarrhea\n                may vary according to the cause and to your tolerance to specific foods.\nDiarrhea can lead to the loss of fluid and minerals, causing dehydration and weak-\nness.\nThe following may help to reduce your symptoms:\n\u2756Drink plenty of fluids with calories to replace loss from chronic diarrhea.  These\nfluids include juices (grape, cranberry, diluted orange juice), fruit punch, nectars\n(apricot, peach, pear mango and banana), lemonade, Gatorade, Kool-Aid and liquid\nnutritional supplements. Water is not a good choice for the majority of your fluid\nintake because it does not give you calories or protein. Drink at least eight glasses of\nhigh calorie, high protein fluids each day. Avoid alcoholic beverages and those\ncontaining caffeine, including coffee because they make you lose fluid stores.  Drink\nfluids at room temperature because very cold or hot liquids may make your diarrhea\nworse.\n\u2756Avoid  milk products temporarily to determine if your symptoms improve.\nPeople who cannot tolerate milk products often manage better with yogurt that\ncontains a Lactobacillus acidophilus culture or lactose-reduced products, such as\nLactaid\u2122 milk.  Ask your Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist about pills or drops to\nreduce bloating, cramps and diarrhea. If you cannot digest lactose-reduced products,\ntry fortified low-fat soymilk.\n\u2756Avoid greasy or fried foods because these may aggravate diarrhea.  You may need\nto eat less fat if your diarrhea results from fat malabsorption. If this is the case,\nchoose lean meats, and avoid adding extra fat to food. Certain nutritional supple-\nments are lactose-free and low in fat, such as Nutren 1.5, CitriSource, Peptamen, or\nCitrotein.   To improve the flavor of these powdered supplements, add them to\nlemonade, juices or nectars. Choose vanilla flavor for more flexibility.\n\u2756Avoid eating roughage fiber in food, including fruits (except bananas), veg-\netables, whole grains, and corn. Instead choose oats, barley, white rice, fruit\nnectars and pureed vegetables or baby food.\n\u2756Ask your physician about anti-diarrheal medications , such as Imodium, Lomotil\nor Paregoric. The medication will vary depending on the cause of your diarrhea. A\ntablespoon of Metamucil mixed with juice may help to control diarrhea. It contains\nsoluble fiber, which like oats and barley, can promote stool bulking.\n\u2756Avoid eating food that may cause cramps or bloating , such as beans, cabbage,\nbroccoli, brussels sprouts, onions, green peppers, and other spicy foods.Diarrhea\nDiarrhea\nNUTRITIONNUTRITION\nNutrition Guidance  4-8 DiarrheaDiarrhea\n\u2756Choose food and fluids that are high in potassium , a mineral that you lose with\ndiarrhea.

High potassium fluids include orange juice, apricot, mango and peach nectars,\nV-8 juice and Gatorade.NUTRITIONNUTRITION\nNutrition Guidance  4-9\nThe Importance of Fluids\nDrinking enough fluids is very important when you are HIV-positive. Fluids help\n                prevent dehydration, especially when you are taking many medications. You need a                great deal of fluids to flush out medications that have been used by your body. Ifyou are having a difficult time maintaining your weight, drink high calorie fluids (eg: juices,\nnectars, fruit punch, sweetened iced tea, lemonade, ginger ale, soda, Gatorade and Kool-Aid)and high calorie, high protein fluids (eg; milk, milkshakes, Lactaid\n\u2122 milk, fortified soymilk,\nfortified nut milks) instead of water. Drink at least eight glasses of fluid each day. Drink\nmore if you are taking many medications. You will need to drink more if the inside of yourmouth or tongue is dry. Avoid drinking beverages that contain caffeine or alcohol, especiallyif you have diarrhea. These products cause further fluid losses. Caffeine-containing beveragesinclude coffee, black tea and many types of soda. Alcohol is low in nutrients and canalso dehydrate you. Salt containing fluids like chicken or beef broth (soups) will makeyou thirsty so that you drink more, consequently helping you retain more fluids.\nCertain parasites are spread through tap water and make you very sick when your\nCD4 count is  below 200 cells/ mm3. Cryptosporidiosis, Mycrosporidiosis and Myco-\nbacterium avium intracellulare (MAI) are in many tap waters and cause flu-like symp-\ntoms that include cramping and massive watery diarrhea. When you drink water, buy dis-\ntilled water or use boiled tap water (boil 5 minutes to kill germs). Also be careful of ice andfountain sodas which are made from tap water and soda syrups. Bottled juices are safe todrink if they are pasteurized.  Be sure to order bottled water and no ice in restaurants.\nDry Mouth can occur as a result of not drinking enough fluids or as a side-effect\nof medications. In addition to drinking enough fluids, the following suggestionscan help you manage this problem:\n\u2756Start and end each day with a glass of water.\n\u2756Use extra sauce, butter, gravy, yogurt or salad dressing to moisten food.\n\u2756Dunk or soak bread, crackers and cookies in soup, milk, juice or hot chocolate.\n\u2756Use sugar-free candy, sour balls, popsicles, safe water/ice cubes, and sugarless\nchewing gum to stimulate salivation.\n\u2756Sleep with a humidifier in your room, and keep fluids by your bedside so you can\ndrink throughout the night if you are thirsty.\nImportance of Fluids\nNUTRITIONNUTRITION\nNutrition Guidance  4-10Constipation  can occur as a result of not drinking enough; not eating enough\nhigh fiber food or being inactive. It can also develop as a side-effect of medica-tions. In addition to drinking enough fluids, the following suggestions may behelpful:\n\u2756  Eat food high in insoluble fiber: whole grain breads and cereals, fresh fruits\n     and vegetables, cooked beans and chickpeas, nuts and seeds.  Add small     amounts of bran to food or liquids to increase dietary fiber.\n\u2756  Add regular exercise into your daily schedule.The Importance of Fluids\nImportance of FluidsNUTRITIONNUTRITION\nNutrition Guidance  4-11Mouth Pain and Painful Swallowing\nMouth Pain\n\u2756Smoking and alcohol can irritate the inside of your mouth.\n\u2756Be careful of very hot food and carbonated sodas.

Allow food to cool down to a lukewarmtemperature before eating.\n\u2756Eat very cold foods, such as sorbet, sherbet, fruit ice, frozen yogurt or\nice cream, to numb your taste buds.\n\u2756Eat soft, bland food, including applesauce, oatmeal, grits, cream of\nrice, creamed soups, custards, pudding, flan, and hard-cooked eggs,and drink non-acidic juices and nectars.\n      Painful Swallowing\n\u2756Use a straw for drinking fluids, and use a cup or glass instead of a\nbowl for eating soup. Tilt your head back for easier swallowing.\n\u2756Choose soft-textured food (oatmeal, cream of rice, canned fruits,\ncottage cheese, yogurt, pudding, flan or custard). Puree food in ablender or food processor or choose baby foods which are alreadypureed for you.\n\u2756Eat food at room temperature. Avoid eating food that is either very hot\nor very cold.\n\u2756   Try a variety of liquid nutritional supplements that are high in calories\nand protein, in addition to soft or pureed food. Examples includeEnsure Plus, Sustacal Plus, Resource Plus, Nutren 1.5, Boost andNutrament. You will need to determine what tastes good to you. Tryblending fresh or canned fruit with vanilla and strawberry flavors, orblend a banana with a chocolate flavor.

The following guidelines can help  you protect yourself from\nfood poisoning when you are preparing and storing food.\n  Food SafetyPreparing Food\n\u2756Wash your hands with warm, soapy water before and after preparing each food.\n\u2756Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly with warm water, a mild soap and a soft bristle\nbrush. You can also use a mixture of 1/2 cup lemon juice to a gallon of warm water. Or, you\ncan remove the skin or the peel from fruits and vegetables before you eat them.\n\u2756Cook meat, poultry and fish to medium or medium-well. Do not eat raw or rare meat espe-\ncially ground meat or poultry. Also avoid raw fish, including sushi, sashimi and steamed\nclams or oysters.\n\u2756Thaw frozen meat and poultry in the microwave or the refrigerator; not at room temperature.\n\u2756Drink pasteurized milk only. Unpasteurized milk or dairy products can carry Salmonella.\n\u2756Don't use eggs that have cracks in their shells. Hard-cook eggs for at least seven minutes or\nfry eggs for at least 3 minutes on each side. Avoid eggs that are lightly poached or prepared\nover easy. Also avoid food that contains raw or partially cooked eggs, such as\nhomemade mayonnaise, hollandaise sauce, homemade ice cream and eggnog,\nraw cake or cookie batter. Caesar salad dressing and the Spanish drink ponche are\nalso very risky.\n\u2756Don't eat soft ripened cheeses, such as Brie and Camembert. Don't eat moldy\nfoods.\n\u2756Make a dilute bleach mix by adding 1-2 tablespoons of bleach to a gallon of warm\nwater. Use this mix to scrub kitchen utensils.\n\u2756Instead of cutting boards which may cause food safety problems, use cheap paper plates\nwhich can be thrown away after using. Clean up was never easier.\n\u2756Keep hot foods hot - baked dishes should be kept at room temperature for no more than 30\nminutes. Germs breed best at room temperature.\n\u2756  Make sure you wash off all cans before opening them; don't forget to wash soda cans before\ndrinking out of them.\nNUTRITIONNUTRITION\nNutrition Guidance  4-17  Food SafetyFood Safety\nStoring Food\n \u2756Get a refrigerator thermometer.

The key to a healthy\n             vegetarian diet is to eat a wide variety of foods. It is very important to get\n             enough calories and protein to keep your muscles and your body healthy\nwhen you are living with HIV.\nDifferent types of vegetarian diets include:\u2756Lacto-ovo vegetarian - a diet which includes foods from plants, milk, dairy and\n   egg sources.\n\u2756Lacto-vegetarian - a diet which includes foods only from plant and dairy sources.\n\u2756Vegan (total vegetarian) - a diet which includes only foods from plants.\nTips for vegetarians to remember\u2756Get help:  Seek out the advice of a Registered Dietitian or other Nutrition Professional.\n\u2756Vegan:   If you are vegan, it may be even more difficult to get the amount of protein\n   and other nutrients that you need every day.  Make sure you get assistance, learn\n   about foods and see that you get the nutrients you need.\n\u2756Variety:   In planning a vegetarian diet choose a wide variety of foods from all the\n   sections of The Vegetarian Food Guide Pyramid\u00a9  (The Health Connection, Hagerstown,\n   Maryland, used with permission - see Page 4-21).  This and other food pyramids\n   are designed for the general public and may not take into account your special\n   needs.  By at least getting the variety of foods described in the food guide pyramid, you\n   can establish a good nutritional foundation that you can build upon.\n\u2756Calories:   Monitor your weight weekly.  You will likely need more than the\n   minimum number of servings in each section of the pyramid to maintain weight and\n   make sure you are getting all the calories, protein and nutrients you need. When\n   trying to keep weight on, some higher calorie plant based foods that can help are:\n   hummus, soy cheese, nut butters, tofu, avocado, and olives.NUTRITIONNUTRITION\nNutrition Guidance  4-20\u2756Protein:   Protein is used to keep muscles healthy and with HIV you may have increased\n   needs for protein. You will probably meet your protein needs if you are eating dairy and egg\n   products daily.  Protein needs for adults may range from 80-125 grams of protein or more\n   every day or more. Read labels and count grams of protein.  Add extra protein by adding\n   protein powder (dry milk, egg or commercial powders) to foods that you eat.  Some good\n   sources of plant-based protein include:\nGuidelines for a Vegetarian Meal PlanGuidelines for a Vegetarian Meal Plan\nFood Portion Size Grams of Protein\nSoybeans 1/2 Cup 14\nTofu 1/2 cup 10Soymilk 1 cup 7-10Lentils 1/2 cup 9\nCooked beans (pinto, navy, red, black,\ngarbanzo, etc.)1/2 cup 7\nPeanut, cashew or almond butter 2 Tablespoons 7\nPotato 1 large 4-5Grains 1/2 cup 2-4NUTRITIONNUTRITION\nNutrition Guidance  4-23Guidelines for a Vegetarian Meal Plan\nHard to get nutrients\nIn a vegetarian diet, vitamin B12, protein, and minerals (calcium, zinc, and iron) may be\ndifficult to get enough of everyday. Learn what foods are high in these nutrients and makesure you include them in your daily diet.  Consider and choose a vitamin-mineral supplementwith your health care provider.  See the lists and chart below for foods high in these nutrients.\nVitamin B12\nUsually only a small amount of vitamin B12 is needed; however with HIV this important\nnutrient can become low in your body more quickly.  Since vitamin B12 is found mainly infoods from animal sources, vegetarians need to be sure they are getting the extra B12 theyneed.  B12 is needed to make nuclear materials in each cell, in the formation of red blood cellsand keeping the nervous system healthy.  People living with HIV may become deficient invitamin B12.  Some good sources of vitamin B12 include:\n\u2756 Cottage cheese, milk, eggs\n\u2756 Other dairy products\n\u2756 Red Star Vegetarian Support Yeast T6635\n\u2756 Vitamin B12 fortified soy milk\n\u2756 Vitamin B12 fortified breakfast foods\n\u2756 Vitamin B12 fortified vegetarian burger patties\nCalcium\nYour bones need calcium to keep them healthy.  It is recommended that you get a t least 800-\n1200 milligrams per day.  Dairy products are rich in calcium.  If you are not eating dairyproducts, consider the following plant-based rich options:\n\u2756 Tofu - that has been preserved in a calcium solution or fortified with calcium\n\u2756 Calcium enriched soy products\n\u2756 Calcium-fortified orange juice\n\u2756 Dark leafy vegetables such as turnip greens, kale, or mustard greens\n\u2756 Broccoli\n\u2756 Pinto beans\n\u2756 Blackstrap Molasses\n\u2756 Figs\nGuidelines for a Vegetarian Meal PlanThe Health Connection (used with permission)NUTRITIONNUTRITION\nNutrition Guidance  4-24Iron\nIron is important for carrying oxygen through the blood so that the food can be burned as fuel.\nIndications of deficiencies may include pale skin, weakness, shortness of breath and lack ofappetite.  Many people may be deficient in iron, however supplementation with iron is notrecommended for HIV positive persons, so including iron-rich foods in your diet is important.Plant-based options include:\n\u2756 Prune juice\n\u2756 Navy beans\n\u2756 Lentils\n\u2756 Spinach\n\u2756 Black beans\n\u2756 Lima beans\n\u2756 Peaches\n\u2756 Split peas\n\u2756 Garbanzo beans\n\u2756 Soybeans\n\u2756 Pinto beans\n\u2756 Blackstrap molasses\n\u2756 Rice bran\nZinc\nZinc is an important nutrient for wound and burn healing, and formation of amino acids and\nnucleic acids.  Deficiencies can cause loss of appetite and change the way things taste.  Peopleliving with HIV may become deficient in zinc.

HIV has spread quickly among all             women: single, married, straight, lesbian, teenager, or grandmother. Recently,there has been evidence showing that HIV disease may progress faster in women.The study compared HIV positive women and men, with similar CD4 counts andviral loads.  The women seemed to begin having opportunistic infections sooner.  Theresults of the study suggest that women need to be treated earlier.  Additional studiesare being done as this is being written.\nIt is common for women to take care of others before they take care of themselves.\nBut being an HIV-positive woman you have your own special needs.  They are justas important as others and demand 100% of your attention.  Taking care of yourselfmeans:\n\u2756  Getting enough rest\n\u2756  Regular exercise (more than just walking)\n\u2756  Eating a healthy diet\n\u2756  Taking all of your medicine, at the right times\n\u2756  Making your own needs a high priority\nFollowing these suggestions will help you live with HIV disease, have more energy,\nand stay well.  The most important thing to remember is that you need to take care ofyourself, even when the demands from family, partners, parents and others seem tobe just as important.\n\u2756 To help you deal with stress, request handouts from your provider from\n    Section 3.\u2756 For tips on how to eat well and plan meals safely and on a budget, ask\n    your provider for the tip pages in Sections 3 and 4.\u2756 Also, think about preparing meals when you feel well, have more energy,\n    or have more time, and freeze them in meal sized portions for later use.    Meals are safe in the freezer for at least two months.\u2756 Other options include home delivered meal programs if you are not able to\n    prepare healthful meals for yourself.\u2756 In some areas, there are group meal programs where you need to go to the\n    location, and  a meal is prepared for you.

As soon as you know you arepregnant, it is vital that you receive prenatal care immediately.\nSince the body is stressed during pregnancy, it is easier for a pregnant woman to get\nsick.  This is one of many important reasons to eat well and rest during your preg-nancy.  During pregnancy, you need to increase your usual healthy dietary intake byabout 300 calories and 10 grams of protein a day.  An extra sandwich a day can dothis for you.  Use the food guide for pregnancy at the end of this section to meet theseneeds.  It is recommended that women gain 25-35 pounds over the course of thepregnancy.  Most women gain 5 pounds the first three months, 10-15 pounds thesecond three months, and up to 15 pounds in the last three months, when the baby isgrowing the fastest.  Discuss how much YOU need to gain with your health careprovider, Registered Dietitian or other nutrition professional.   The amount of weightgain will change depending on your age, your weight before pregnancy, and otherfactors.\nThere are other problems that can occur with any pregnancy, including high blood\npressure, constipation, heartburn, and high blood sugar.  Your provider will check forthese problems during many of your visits.  Should any of these problems occur, theycan be controlled through diet and/or medication and should be discussed with yourhealth care provider.\nTo give you the extra vitamins and minerals needed during pregnancy, many health\ncare providers prescribe a pre-natal vitamin and mineral supplement.  Be sure to takethis pill with food.  If you are given extra iron, increase your fluid and fiber intake toavoid constipation.  This means drinking lots of water or fruit juice (not soda), andincluding fruits and vegetables in most of your meals and snacks.\nBe sure to discuss any alternative therapies with your health care provider, including\nlarge doses of any vitamin or mineral supplements, other HIV medicines,over-the-counter medicines, herbal therapies, and acupuncture. More is NOT alwaysbetter and can be harmful to the baby. Remember to talk with your health care pro-vider about any cultural or religious practices, including fasts, which affect your diet.\nPregnancyNutrition Guidance for Positive Women\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

If you must have some, try to have\nno more than 8 ounces (1 small cup) of caffeinated coffee or tea, soda (Pepsi,Coca-cola, Mountain Dew, Mellow Yellow, Dr. Pepper and others), orchocolate-containing beverages a day.  One to 2 cups of coffee have been shown tonegatively effect the outcomes of births.  Also, the effect of caffeine lasts 20 timeslonger for a fetus than for an adult. Limit chocolate candy too.  Cigarettes, alcoholand street drugs can cause permanent damage to your baby, and should be avoided.\nOnce your baby is born, do not be too anxious to lose the extra weight you may\nhave gained.  You will lose 15-20 pounds right after the baby is born.  For the restof the weight loss, discuss a slow weight loss plan (about a half to one pound aweek), with your health care provider or Dietitian.  This will allow you to maintainyour muscle, and eat enough of the foods your body needs to stay healthy and giveyou energy to care for your baby.\nFOOD GUIDE FOR PREGNANCY\nFOOD GROUP\nBread, Cereal, Pasta & Rice\nAt least 9 servings\nFruits & Vegetables\nAt least 6 servings total\nMeat and Alternatives\nAt least 3 servings\nMilk, Yogurt and Cheese\nAt least 4 servingsSERVING SIZE\n1 slice bread\n1/2 hamburger or hot dog bun, or English muffin3-4 saltines1/2 cup cooked cereal (2 serving spoonfuls)3/4 - 1 cup dry cereal (small bowl)\n3/4 cup juice (small glass)\n1 piece fresh fruit1/2 cup canned fruit (small bowl)1/4 cup dried fruit (such as raisins) (2 handfuls)\n2-3 ounces cooked meats (palm of your hand)\n2 hard cooked eggs4 tablespoons peanut butter or other nut butter1 cup cooked dried beans (kidney, navy, etc)1/2 cup nuts or seeds (pumpkin or sunflower)5-6 ounces tofu\n1 cup milk (medium glass or a mug)\n8 ounces yogurt (single serving sized carton)1-2 ounces cheese (2-3 slices)1/2 cup cottage cheese (small bowl)Nutrition Guidance for Positive Women\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

Manywomen find some relief by taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement.  Cutting backon caffeine may help with breast tenderness.  Limiting salty foods (pickles, cannedmeats and vegetables, most soups, etc.)  and snack foods such (potato chips, pretzelsand salted crackers) may help decrease bloating.  Continue with your regular exerciseprogram, and get enough rest.\nMenopause\nAs with all women going through menopause, you may go through changes such as\nhot flashes and vaginal dryness.  Nutritionally, it is suggested that you increase thenumber of calcium containing foods in your diet to 4 to 5 a day.  These foods includemilk, cheese, yogurt, calcium-fortified soy products (soymilk, tofu), calcium-fortifiedorange juice, green leafy vegetables  (collard greens, turnip greens, and mustardgreens), and sardines.  If you cannot drink milk or eat dairy products, ask your healthcare provider about a calcium supplement.

It is recommended that you lose fat, but try to gain muscle (lean bodymass). Building muscle will help with weight loss.  It will help you to keep yourimmune function and avoid illness.\nUnplanned weight loss can be serious and needs to be controlled quickly.  Tell your\nprimary care provider and Dietitian about any weight loss, especially unplanned andrapid weight loss.  Should appetite be the issue, eating small, frequent meals mayhelp.  There are also medicines that can help increase your appetite, includingMegace (liquid form) and Marinol (pill form) that is normally taken once or twice aday.  It is often recommended to take Marinol at night, as you can sleep through theeffects but enjoy a bigger appetite the next day. Request the information from HealthAssurance (Section 3) on the Healthy Weight Gain Program to learn how to lose fatand gain muscle.\nIf you are losing muscle, there are several things you can do.  Be sure to mention any\nbody changes to your primary care provider.  Resistance exercise is needed to main-tain muscle.  See Section 3 for tips on exercise.  Testosterone is one medicine that isused when men lose muscle. There has been some proof (although still in the experi-ment stage) that this medicine in much lower doses may help women as well.Women require a special preparation testosterone in a much smaller dosage worn asa patch right on the skin.  Some synthetic forms of anabolic steroids may be usedwith caution. Women can experience side effects with these medicines, though lessfrequently with oxandrolone.  Women should not use oxymetholone.  Anabolicsteroids can cause \"masculinization\" of the female fetus, among other problems andshould not be used during pregnancy. Growth hormone is also a possible choice. Ifyou are taking any these medications to obtain their full benefit, it is very importantto make sure you eat enough daily and do resistance exercise 20 minutes a day 3times a week.\nWeight IssuesNutrition Guidance for Positive Women\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

This is becoming more common in people using many of themedicines to control HIV .  Your provider may also identify that some of your labtests are showing abnormal results, especially for cholesterol and triglycerides.  It isbeing termed \"lipodystrophy syndrome\" or lipoatrophy, or the unusual distributionof fat.  While these changes may not be directly related to your diet or exerciseroutine, it is important that you continue to exercise and eat well to maintainmuscle.  A good diet and routine exercise may also prove to be helpful in this newcondition.

When theimmune system is not working well, as with HIV-infection, this type of yeast cangrow out of control.  You may have vaginal itching and discomfort, or painfulchewing and swallowing.  Be sure to mention any of these symptoms to yourhealth care provider.  There are medicines that can help decrease your symptoms.Section 4 can provide eating tips until you feel better.\nThe role of diet in the development of yeast infections is questionable.  Many find\navoiding simple sugars helps, including the sugar in the fluids you drink.  You maywant to limit the amount of fruit juice, fruit punch, soda, Kool-aid, etc., and drinksafe water instead. Taking \"swish and swallow\" medications following a sugarydrink or food can also help.   A daily serving or two of yogurt with live cultures,especially Lactobacillus acidophilus,  may help fight the growth of Candida\nalbicans .   You can buy the Lactobacillus acidophilus by itself, but this product\nrequires refrigeration.\nTalk to your Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist about any diet changes you make to\nfight yeast, especially if any food groups need to be avoided from time to time.\nShe or he can suggest other foods to try so that your eating plan still includes allthe nutrition you need while fitting your lifestyle.\nYeast InfectionsNutrition Guidance for Positive Women\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

Quick Nutrition Screen:  Question #1\nMore information about your YES  answers\nBe sure to call your health care provider if your child has diarrhea\nand/or a fever, especially in very young children.\nMy child has not gained enough weight or has lost weight\nContinued gradual growth and weight gain and a healthful diet are extremely\nimportant in maintaining the best possible health for normal growth and devel-opment of all children.  When a child is infected with HIV, normal growth andweight gain become even more important.   Not only is the child's body grow-ing, it is also dealing with the extra demands and effects of the disease, as wellas coping with possible side effects of the treatment.\nA Registered Dietitian / Nutritionist can help you identify the possible causes\nof the poor growth and weight gain, and help check on your child's progress onhis/her \"Growth Curve\" that your health care provider keeps.  This provides away to see what your child should weigh.  It can also show that if what you aredoing to increase dietary intake is helping your child's growth get \"back ontrack\".\nCommon reasons for eating problems include:\n\u2756 Sore mouth/throat - see Nutrition Tip Sheets #2  and #4 for suggestions\n\u2756 Nausea and vomiting, upset stomach, diarrhea, constipation - see Nutrition\n    Tip Sheets #2 and #3 for suggestions\n\u2756 Emotional or behavioral problems - consult your primary care provider for a\n    referral for psychological assessment and counseling\u2756 Mealtime atmosphere - see Nutrition Tip Sheet #5  for suggestions\n\u2756 Picky eater -  see Nutrition Tip Sheets  #4  and #5\n\u2756 Sick a lot - see Nutrition Tip Sheets #2  and #4Childrens Issues  6-4Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

My child is eating less than usual\nEating behaviors:\nAll toddlers and pre-school aged children are learning to be independent, so it is\ncommon for food likes and dislikes to become bigger issues at this age.Caregivers must provide not only healthy foods to meet the child's growingneeds, but also establish a comfortable eating setting.  In this way, healthfuleating attitudes and habits can develop. See Nutrition Tip Sheet #5 for sugges-\ntions on developing good eating habits and attitudes.\nGetting your child to eat when they do not feel well:\nSide effects of illness and treatment vary with each child and it is not possible topredict how the disease or treatment may affect a child.  Tips that help in man-aging illnesses and side effects of treatment also vary with each child.  Someapproaches and foods that work with one child may not work with the next.\nSee Nutrition Tip Sheets #2  and #6 for ideas to control the side effects of\ntreatments and make the best of nutrition during these difficult times.\nQuick Nutrition Screen:  Question #2\nMore information about your YES  answersChildrens Issues  6-5Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

Animal foods such as meat,\nfish, poultry, and dairy products like milk, cheese and yogurt are all good sourcesof protein.  At the age of nine months, most children will accept pureed meats.Children should be about one year of age when they are offered table meats.  Atone, most children can eat tender meats.  Sometimes children with HIV require alittle extra time to get ready to eat different types of solids. When a child showsup and down chewing and is able to move food to the sides of his/her mouth thenhe/she is ready for small bites of soft meats. If your child has reached 15 monthsof age and does not show these signs, then you should consult your physician or aRegistered Dietitian or other nutrition professional.\nSometimes small children and toddlers do not eat different types of meats, fish\nand poultry because they do not like the texture or the way that food feels in his/her mouth.  This kind of problem requires a little more time and patience withfeeding. Start by offering very soft, well-cooked or stewed meats. Try addingthem to his/her favorite foods in very small pieces. For example, add a smallamount of chicken, turkey or beef to soup, or add these foods to mashed potatoesor pasta dishes. As they become used to the taste and feel, they will accept largerpieces.  See Nutrition Tip Sheet #5  for more ideas on how to feed your toddler.\nIf your child is not ready or continues to refuse meats even in very small pieces,\ncontinue to offer these foods at least once a week.  Meanwhile, how can you besure your child is receiving enough protein in his or her diet?  Foods such asscrambled eggs, peanut butter, tofu and cooked beans all are excellent sources ofprotein and are fine meat substitutes.\nThe following foods are considered a serving of protein:\n1 year -old 2-3 years old 4-5 years old\nEggs 111\nPeanut Butter Not recommended 1 Tablespoon 3 Tablespoons\nCooked Beans & Peas 1/4 cup 1/3 cup 1/2 cup\nMeat, Poultry, Fish 1 ounce 1 ounce 1-2 ounces\nTofu 1/3 cup 1/3 cup 1/2 cupQuick Nutrition Screen:  Question #3\nMore information about your YES  answers\nChildrens Issues  6-6Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

Most\nchildren like fruits because of their sweet taste.  Vegetables are often harder toget them to eat. See Nutrition Tip Sheet #5  for ideas. The vitamins and\nminerals found in fruits and vegetables are very important to support theimmune system and help fight infections.  Fruits and vegetables are also agood source of fiber and water and are important for your child\u2019s health andbowel function.  See Nutrition Tip Sheet #3 .\nAdd fruit and vegetables to your child\u2019s diet by trying the\nfollowing:\n\u2756 Offer 8 ounces of fruit juice per day  (this equals 2 servings of fruit)\n\u2756 Serve soups and stews thick with different kinds of vegetables\n\u2756 Let your child choose the vegetables he/she wants to add to homemade\n    soups\u2756 Offer raw fruits with a yogurt dip\n\u2756 Offer vegetables with a creamy dressing or dip.

Quick Nutrition Screen:  Question #5\nMore information about your YES  answers\nMy child does not drink milk or eat dairy products, such as\ncheese, yogurt or ice cream\nSome children simply do not like or refuse milk or dairy products.  The follow-\ning is for those children who do not get enough milk and dairy products to meettheir body's needs for calcium and other nutrients.\nFor those children, who do not drink milk or eat dairy products because they\nhave symptoms like gas, bloating, cramps and diarrhea when milk products areeaten see Quick Nutrition Screen Question #9, where lactose intolerance isdiscussed.\nEveryone, especially children, needs the vitamins and minerals found in milk\nand milk products.  Milk products provide a lot of calcium.  This nutrient isnecessary to build and keep strong bones and teeth in babies, infants, children,and adults.    Normal growth is sometimes a problem with children infectedwith HIV . Avoiding or not getting these foods in the diet for more than a fewmonths could produce some nutrient deficiencies and create growth and bonedevelopment problems.\nHere are some ideas to add milk and milk products to the diet:Use milk in cooking:Add fluid milk to:Add dry milk to:\n\u2756 Creamed soups \u2756 Mashed potatoes\n\u2756 Puddings and custards \u2756 Dough for tortillas\n\u2756 Sauces and gravies \u2756 Bread, biscuits, muffins\n\u2756 Hot cereals \u2756 Meatloaf, meatballs, hamburgers\n\u2756 Scalloped and au gratin potatoes\nNote: 1/3 cup of dry milk=1 cup of fluid milkChildrens Issues  6-9Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

Quick Nutrition Screen:  Question #6\nMore information about your YES  answers\nMy child does not eat whole-grains\n(whole wheat bread, whole-grain cereals)\nGrains are an excellent source of energy, B1 (thiamine) and B2 (riboflavin).\nThiamine and riboflavin are important for energy metabolism and a healthynervous system.  People who are HIV infected are more likely to become low inthese B vitamins because they are absorbed in the small intestine and stored inthe muscle.  Malabsorption, diarrhea, wasting, and malnutrition can all contrib-ute to low levels of these vitamins.\nGrains are an excellent source of fiber.  The fiber in whole grains helps normal-\nize the bowels, that is, helps stop constipation and diarrhea. See Nutrition Tip\nSheets #2  and #3.  The energy (calories) from the grains helps spare the body\u2019s\nprotein for muscle development.  Some children prefer not to eat whole grainbreads and cereals because they are not familiar with the taste and texture.  Letthem see you enjoy eating these foods.\nKeep these foods on hand and offer them regularly:\n\u2756 Whole grain crackers with cheese or peanut butter\n\u2756 Muffins made with whole wheat\n\u2756 Whole grain breads for sandwiches and toast\n\u2756 Whole grain cereals, waffles, pancakes, tortillas, and pita bread\nSee Nutrition Tip Sheet #5.Childrens Issues  6-11Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

My child drinks more than 8 ounces of soda, \"fruity\" juices\nor drinks or tea each day\nSoda, soft drinks and tea are not good sources of nutrition and if consumed in\nlarge quantities often replace nutritious foods that will help your child grow,gain weight and stay well. While fruit juice does contain some vitamins andminerals, it usually has only a few nutrients. See Nutrition Tip Sheet #5 .   On\nthe other hand, \"fruity\" soft drinks, like Kool-Aid, Hawaiian Punch or OrangeDelight contains little or no natural fruit juice and little if any nutrients.

Quick Nutrition Screen:  Question #8\nMore information about your YES  answers\nMy child who is over 2 years old continues to drink from a\nbottle\nBetween their first and second birthday, most children will be drinking from a\ncup. By this age some children will still want their bottle more for comfortrather than because they are hungry. If your child is able to drink from the cup,he or she does not need a bottle. Try offering stuffed animals or a special blan-ket to replace the bottle at naptime and bedtime. Continued use of the bottleallows a constant contact of sugary liquid (from juice, punch or milk) with theteeth that causes cavities, pain, and may eventually require dental surgery tohave the diseased teeth pulled.  See Nutrition Tip Sheet #1 .\nIf the child is allowed to drink frequent bottles of juice or milk throughout the\nday, their stomachs become full of liquids and they have little interest in eatingtheir meals or snacks.  Children cannot get all the nutrition that they need frommilk and juice.  Nutrients that are important for growth and a healthy immunesystem will be missing from the child\u2019s diet.  In addition, this is the time of atoddler\u2019s life that they should be learning to eat solid foods, drink from a cupand feed themselves.  If they are drinking rather than eating most of theirnutrition, they are not practicing the skills needed to successfully feed them-selves.  See Nutrition Tip Sheet #5 .\nIf your child is drinking more than 24 ounces of milk from\nthe bottle per day and is refusing to eat their food, try the\nfollowing:\n\u2756 Limit milk to 24 ounces per day\n\u2756 Limit juice to 8 ounces per day\n\u2756 Offer all liquids from a cup before allowing the bottle\n\u2756 Don't give liquids at least one hour before meals\n\u2756 Offer only 6 to 8 ounces of liquid at the mealtime\n\u2756 Praise your child for drinking from the cup and eating by himself\n\u2756 Use a \u201csippy\u201d cup that can be sealed for travel\nTalk with your healthcare provider about your concernsChildrens Issues  6-13Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

Quick Nutrition Screen:  Question #9\nMore information about your YES  answers\nMy child has gas, bloating or stomach aches a lot\nThe gas, bloating and stomach ache may be caused by lactose intolerance. Other\nfactors that can cause gas, bloating and stomach ache include medication intol-erance, gastro-esophageal reflux, or opportunistic infections.  It is important totalk with you health care provider to determine the cause of the symptoms.\nLactose intolerance  means that the body does not have (or have enough of) the\nenzyme lactase to be able to digest or absorb the carbohydrate called lactose ormilk sugar that is found in milk.  Those with lactose intolerance have increasedgas, abdominal bloating, or diarrhea after eating foods containing lactose.Lactose is found in milk or anything made from milk.  This includes cheese,yogurt, ice cream, instant breakfast powder, infant formulas made from cow'smilk, and breast milk.\nThe level of lactose intolerance may vary from child to child; some may tolerate\ncheese and yogurt made with live cultures, but not milk or ice cream, whileanother may not tolerate any of these.  Some fermented dairy products likeyogurt, sour cream, buttermilk , or specially treated milks like Lactaid or\nacidophilus milk  may be better tolerated.  Non-dairy products such as calcium\nfortified rice milk, soy milk and soy cheese  are also good options.

Always speak to yourdoctor and/or Registered Dietitian or other nutrition professional before givingyour child a vitamin or mineral supplement.\nInfants\nVitamins and minerals are added to infant formulas; if your infant is drinkingabout 24 to 28 ounces of formula a day, he/she is probably getting enoughvitamins and minerals. If your infant is drinking less than 24 ounces of formula,then a liquid multivitamin is generally recommended. Liquid vitamins usuallydo not contain minerals.  When your infant is old enough to chew well, it is agood time to switch to the chewable tablet containing minerals.\nChildren\nA multi-vitamin with  minerals in liquid or pill form is recommended for all\nchildren over 1 year of age with HIV .  The supplement should provide no morethan 100% of the Recommended Dietary Intake (RDI) or Recommended Di-etary Allowance (RDA).  Brand names of some children's chewable vitamin andmineral supplements that will meet your child's needs include: Bug's Bunnywith Minerals, Flinstones Complete and Centrum for Kids Complete.\nGeneric and store brands may also be good.

Quick Nutrition Screen:  Question #13\nMore information about your YES  answers\nMy child takes extra vitamins or herbs\nChildren with HIV infection have increased needs for vitamins and minerals.  A\nnormal diet may not provide adequate amounts of key nutrients, either becauseof nutritional losses with vomiting or diarrhea or because of increased needs tofight infection.  It is recommended that children with HIV/AIDS take a dailypediatric multiple vitamin and mineral supplement which provides 100% of theRecommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for the B vitamins, Vitamins A, D,E, C, folic acid, iron, selenium and zinc.  Children younger than 2 years oldshould be given a liquid vitamin/mineral preparation.  Children older than 2years old may be given a chewable tablet.\nHerbal remedies are not recommended for children.  Safe dosages for children\nhave not been determined. Dosages of key ingredients may vary from product toproduct. Plus, how herbs interact with medications is not known.  The smallbody size of children makes it easy to mistakenly give toxic dosages.  If you areconsidering offering your child an herbal remedy, discuss this with your child'spediatrician first.Childrens Issues  6-18Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

Quick Nutrition Screen:  Question #14\nMore information about your YES  answers\nOur family has difficulty getting enough food\nMany families have difficulty paying bills and buying enough food. In the USA\nwe are fortunate because we have many government sponsored and privatelysponsored food programs. Some of those programs include the Special Supple-mental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Food Stamps,School lunch and breakfast, soup kitchens, food pantries and home deliveredmeal programs.\nYour Registered Dietician or other health professional, Nutritionist, social\nworker, or case manager can help you enroll in these programs if you are eli-gible.\nUnfortunately, even with these food programs, many families still have diffi-\nculty keeping enough food in the house all the time. Moreover, some of us maynot be enrolled in food programs but still want to save money. Some tips formanaging your family\u2019s meals on a limited income are below.\nTips for managing your family\u2019s meals on a limited income:\n\u2756 Buy store brand items.  They are usually less expensive than brand name\n    foods. Store brand frozen foods are especially economical.\u2756 Try to buy the week\u2019s \u201cspecials\u201d. It may be possible to save as much as 40 -\n    50 cents a pound on meat if you buy it on special. However, watch    \u201cbargains\u201d. If an item is featured make sure it is actually priced lower than    usual and is really the least expensive option. Also watch the expiration date,    and don't buy meat that is outdated.\u2756 You may find markdowns on slightly old fruits and vegetables on Saturdays.\n    If a head of lettuce or escarole has been trimmed down so that the dark outer    leaves are gone - it is too old. Bagged apples and oranges are usually less    expensive, but be sure to check them for freshness.

After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it. \u2756 Buy fresh produce in season.\n\u2756 To get the most value for your dollar, it is important to learn how to cook\n    basic foods. Next to eating out, the most expensive thing is buying    \u201cconvenience\u201d foods. In general, the more processed the food is, the more    expensive it is. For example, it is less expensive to make mashed potatoes    from whole potatoes than to buy instant mashed potatoes.\u2756 If you buy frozen vegetables, it is more economical to buy the packages\n    without seasoning or sauces built in and then add your own.\u2756 Spices can be expensive, but they will save you money when you buy foods\n    without seasonings and add your own.  Buy a spice once or twice a month to    build up a good selection. Fresh herbs such as cilantro and parsley may be    less expensive, but won\u2019t last as long.\u2756 To lower your food budget you may want to shop for less expensive foods to\n    substitute for the ones you currently buy. For example beef might be replaced    with turkey or beans. If prices are up on rice or grits, substitute with pasta or    bread.\u2756 If you really enjoy eating meat, learn what good pieces of meat look\n    like. There are many cuts between sirloin steak and hamburger. Bone-in    chuck steaks cost about the same as hamburger and make great broiled    steaks. You can also serve meat with rice or vegetables so that the meat    portion size can be smaller.\u2756 Learn to read labels. Ingredients are listed in order of quantity.\n\u2756 Learn terms and standards specified by the USDA.  For example, fruit punch\n    is not 100% fruit juice, luncheon meats have more meat than meat loaves    such as chicken loaf, and processed cheese has less cheese because fillers are    used.\u2756 Pay attention to packaging, for example, sugar in the bag is cheaper than in\n    the box, and spices in fancy boxes are more costly.\u2756 Use unit pricing - the cost per ounce or per unit of the product - to compare\n    the cost of similar products. Unit prices can be found on the label or the shelf    below the product.Childrens Issues  6-20Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

The large number\nof medications, large size of some of the pills, horrible tastes of many liquid\nmedications, and additional diet changes to accommodate the medications all\nmake it hard for a child.\nThe following suggestions may make it easier to give medica-\ntions:\n\u2756 Be honest with your child.  Talk with him or her before offering new\n    medicines or changing his medicine schedule.\n\u2756 Whenever possible, give your child some control over how to take medicines.\n    For example, ask if he or she would like to take the medicine before or after a\n    favorite story or television show.\n\u2756 Discuss scheduling of the medication with your child's physician, pharmacist\n    or nurse in order to group medicines that can be taken together and decrease\n    the number of times the child's day is interrupted.\n\u2756 If allowed or possible, refrigerate liquid medications in order to decrease the\n    smell and taste sensation.  Also, taste buds can be dulled by chewing ice or\n    Popsicles before taking medication.\n\u2756 Use thick foods to coat the mouth. A small amount of peanut butter or\n    pudding may coat the mouth and decrease the affect of a bad tasting liquid\n    medication.  Check with your child's physician to ensure that the food offered\n    can be taken with the medication.\n\u2756 Use chasers.

Nutrition Tip Sheet #2\nFeeding Your Sick Child\nNausea and Vomiting:\n\u2756 Call your doctor to help identify the cause of nausea and vomiting if possible.\n    Treat as suggested.\u2756 Position the child in a more upright position (raised head of bed, using\n    pillows for propping with older children).\u2756 During waking hours offer small meals every 2 hours, and fluids every 1-2 hours.\n\u2756 Provide simply prepared foods, like plain rice or pasta, potatoes, pretzels, cooked\n    or canned fruit and vegetables, baked chicken or turkey, sherbet, angel food cake.\u2756 If possible, adjust timing of nausea-causing medications to one-half hour\n    before meals.\u2756 Try dry plain foods like toast, crackers, dry cereal.\n\u2756 Serve liquid after meals, as liquids can increase feeling of fullness; try cool or\n    chilled liquids.\u2756 AVOID:  high fat or greasy foods, or foods with strong flavors or spices.\n\u2756 AVOID:  feeding the child in a stuffy, over-warm room, or one with strong\n    cooking or food odors.\u2756 Try giving foods that are cold or room temperature rather than hot foods.  For\n    example, a cold turkey sandwich rather than hot turkey with gravy.\nDiarrhea:\n\u2756 Identify cause of diarrhea if possible and treat as indicated.\n\u2756 During waking hours, offer fluids every 1-2 hours - especially diluted fruit\n    juices (half water and half juice), sports drinks, or Pedialyte; drinking liquids    is very important to prevent dehydration.\u2756 If dairy products seem to make diarrhea worse, avoid them until your child is\n    better (If lactose intolerance is suspected, see Quick Nutrition Screen Question #9 ).\n\u2756 If high fat foods seem to make diarrhea worse, offer low fat foods and ask\n    your doctor or Registered Dietitian or other nutrition professional about using    a supplement with MCT oil.\u2756 During waking hours, offer small meals every 2 hours.\n\u2756 Try plain rice or pasta, cooked cereal, soft cooked eggs, ripe bananas, canned\n    fruit, plain baked or boiled lean chicken or turkey, white bread or toast.Childrens Issues  6-32Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.   After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it. \u2756 Eat foods with sodium and potassium, to replace minerals lost in diarrhea.\n    Examples of sodium and potassium rich foods are: bouillon, broth, bananas,    peach and apricot nectar, and potatoes.\u2756 If your child almost always has diarrhea, try to increase soluble fiber (like\n    fruit and vegetables without skins or seeds, rice, oatmeal, and potatoes).\u2756 AVOID:  greasy, fried, high fat foods, spicy foods, chocolate, caffeine-\n    containing soft drinks.\nFever:\nIn general, a fever increases the child's fluid and energy needs.  To preventdehydration, getting enough fluid intake is very important.\n\u2756 Offer sips of fluid almost hourly each hour your child is awake.\n\u2756 Offer diluted fruit juice (half water and half juice) or drinks rather than water.\n\u2756 Offer  meat or vegetable broth.\n\u2756 Use oral rehydration products, such as Pedialyte or Ricelyte,  as\n           recommended by your health care provider.\n\u2756 Offer soft foods as tolerated.Childrens Issues  6-33Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

It can be caused by not eating\nenough high fiber foods, not drinking enough liquid, and/or not enough physicalactivity.  It can also be a side effect of medication.\nFluids:\nFluid needs for children will depend upon how much he or she weighs. In general,the fluid needs of children are higher per pound than adults. Their fluid needs perpound of body weight gradually decrease as the child gains more weight.\nWeight of child Needs to drink per day\n20 pounds 30 ounces - 3 3/4 cups\n25 pounds 35 ounces - 4 1/3 cups\n30 pounds 40 ounces - 5 cups\n35 pounds 43 ounces - 5 1/3 cups\n40 pounds 46 ounces - 5 3/4 cups\n45-50 pounds 50 ounces - 6 1/4 cups\n51-60 pounds 55 ounces - 6 1/4 cups\n61-70 pounds 57 ounces - 7 1/4 cups\n71-80 pounds 58 ounces - 7 1/4 cups\n81-99 pounds 60 ounces - 7 1/2 cups\n100-140 pounds 65-70 ounces - 8 1/4 - 8 3/4 cups\nIf a child is over 120 pounds, the guideline for fluid in the same as in adults -\nabout 1/2 ounce of water per pound of body weight. This may equal 8-10 cupsof fluid per day.  Fluid needs are met by drinking enough water, milk, juice,\nsoups, and other liquids each day.\nHigh Fiber Foods:\nFor normal bowel \"function\", a child needs a balance of fiber from fruit andvegetables and whole grains.  A general recommendation is to provide 5 serv-ings of fruit and/or vegetables per day, as well as 2-3 servings of foods madefrom whole grains.\n\u2756 Read labels of bread and cereal products for fiber content, look for foods\n           that contain at least 2-3 grams of fiber per serving\n\u2756 Use breads made from 100% whole wheat flour\n\u2756 Use nuts and seeds in cooking\n\u2756 Add wheat or oat bran to baked foods\n\u2756 Eat legumes (such as pinto, kidney, garbanzo beans, or peas)              Getting Enough\n              Physical Activity:    See Nutrition Screen Ques-    tion #20 for ideas to increase       your child's daily physical                activity level.\nChildrens Issues  6-34Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

Nutrition Tip Sheet #7\nAvoiding Foodborne Illness\nWhy is it important to be careful about food sanitation?Public health and food safety experts estimate that millions of illnesses can be\ntraced to contaminated food. Harmful microorganisms such as bacteria or\u201cgerms\u201d are present everywhere, and food is a good place for these germs tolive and reproduce. Children, the elderly and people who have compromisedimmune systems are the most likely to become sick from spoiled food becausethey cannot fight off the germs. Food poisoning can strike anywhere from twohours to two days after eating. Some toxins in fish can work within minutes,while botulism could take up to a week.  Foodborne illness can be minimized orprevented if proper precautions are taken.\nSafe Food Handling Tips:\n\u2756 Wash hands with soap before, during, and after handling food.\n\u2756 Always wash your hands well after going to the bathroom or diapering your\n    baby. Teach children to wash their hands, too.\u2756 Teach children to wash hands each time they handle food and each time they\n    use the bathroom, too.  Make a game of hand washing. For example, each    time scrub hands singing a different nursery rhyme.\u2756 Wash and sanitize all work surfaces, cutting boards, knives, and utensils. Use\n    a dishwasher with water temperature set on high if available.\u2756 Wash your hands again after touching any raw meat, raw fish, raw chicken,\n    raw turkey, raw pork, or raw eggs. Never let any raw juices from these\n    foods touch any other food.\u2756 Do not serve or eat raw fish like sushi, oysters, or clams.\n\u2756 Do not serve or eat raw eggs, and cook all foods made with raw eggs, such as\n    cookie dough, bread, or cake batter before eating. Do not add raw eggs to    drinks such as malts or shakes.\u2756 Freeze foods at 0 degrees Fahrenheit or below. Refrigerate foods at 40\n    degrees Fahrenheit or below. Buy a freezer/refrigerator thermometer at the    supermarket and check it regularly.\u2756 Thaw or defrost meats, chicken, and turkey in your refrigerator overnight or\n    in a microwave oven. If these foods are thawed or defrosted in the    microwave, cook them right away. Never thaw or defrost meats on the    counter at room temperature.Childrens Issues  6-41Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.   After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it. \u2756 Refrigerating and freezing food can slow down growing bacteria but not kill\n    them. Once frozen foods thaw or defrost to room temperature, bacteria can    grow again. Bacteria multiply the fastest between the temperatures 40    degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Bacteria die at high    temperatures when food is well cooked through to the middle.\u2756 Use a meat thermometer to check the internal (inside) temperature of food.\n\u2022 Beef should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 170 degrees  Fahrenheit.\u2022 Lamb, chicken, and turkey should be cooked to an internal temperature of  at least to 180 degrees Fahrenheit.\u2022 Foods cooked in a microwave may heat unevenly. Be sure to follow the  microwave directions, and check internal food temperatures in a variety of  areas.\n\u2756 Do not allow foods to sit at room temperature for more than 2 hours.\n\u2756 Cool leftovers in the refrigerator or freezer. Large batches of cooked food\n    should be divided into small portions in shallow containers then put into the    refrigerator or freezer so food can cool faster.\u2756 Check with your local Environmental Protection Agency or water source\n    agency for information about germs that may be in tap water.\u2756 Teach children about \"unsafe\" food and water.  Teach them to politely say \"no\n    thank you\" to when they are offered \"unsafe\" food or water.\nFor more information on food and water safety see References (Section 10) .Childrens Issues  6-42Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

A baseline nutritional assessment should be completed as soon after a child is\nidentified as HIV-infected as possible in order to prevent malnutrition andgrowth failure.  Nutritional reassessment by the Registered Dietitian or othernutrition professional should be done at least every 6 months.  More frequentevaluation and intervention are warranted when clinical symptoms or growthabnormalities are present. (1)\nA complete nutritional assessment includes weight, height, head circumference\n(to 36 months of age), and body composition assessment.  Body compositioncan be evaluated using skinfold measurements (eg. tricep and subscapular) orbioelectrical impedence.  Weight and height growth velocities should be evalu-ated using the National Center for Health Statistics growth charts and/or theincremental growth charts.  Deceleration of the growth velocities indicates theneed to evaluate for nutritional intervention. (1)(2)(3)\nThe biochemical markers that should be a standard component of evaluation are\nalbumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin, hematocrit, cholesterol and triglycerides. Ifmicronutrient deficiencies are suspected, specific serum assays should beassessed. (2)(3)\nThe child\u2019s typical intake should be assessed using 24-hour recall, food record,\nand/or food frequency questionnaire.  Signs of poor intake or excessive lossesthrough diarrhea or vomiting are important to investigate and appropriatenutrition intervention should be incorporated in the overall nutritional care plan.\nRefer to Children/Adolescent HIV/AIDS Medical Nutrition Protocol (3) and\nNutrition Referral Criteria for Pediatrics (under 18 years) with HIV/AIDS (4),both located in Algorithms (Section 9).\nFor more information, see References (Section 11 ).For the Clinician #1\nGeneral MonitoringChildrens Issues  6-43Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.   After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it. For the Clinician #2\nPediatric Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition\nAll parents want their children to enjoy a wide variety of nutritious foods and\nexperience the special nurturing that takes place around the family table.  Thereare times, however, when children with poor growth on formula or table fooddiets may require enteral nutrition (tube feedings) or parenteral nutrition (intra-venous feedings).  During these times every effort must be made to make thesealternative feeding methods safe and effective while maintaining the child'spositive relationship to food and the home feeding environment.\nEnteral Nutrition The prevention of malnutrition or wasting syndrome in children with HIV\ndisease is a major concern.  Children who fail to grow adequately on calorie-enhanced oral diets, who have difficulty eating or who have difficulty absorbingand using nutrients may benefit from using enteral nutrition or tube feedings.Common problems specific to HIV disease which may require the use of tubefeedings include growth failure, painful swallowing, infection, chronic diarrhea,vomiting or excessive spitting up, loss of appetite due to fever or chronic dis-ease, brain damage, and stomach or intestinal problems. (Winter and Chang,1996)  Depression in children with HIV disease may be an under-recognizedcontributor to loss of appetite and poor growth. (Deatrick, et al., 1998)\nTube feedings may provide a child's complete diet or they may be used as a\nsupplement to a regular diet.  The mildly malnourished child who is able to eatand absorb nutrients should not be tube fed unless major efforts to increase thenutritional content of formula or table foods have failed.  Tube feedings may notbe advised if the child is very malnourished or has severe vomiting or diarrhea.In these situations, intravenous nutrition or parenteral nutrition may be required.Often, however, it is possible to combine some amount of enteral nutrition withintravenous nutrition.\nWhen short-term use of the feeding tube is expected, placing the feeding tube\ninto the nose is preferred.  Long term use of nasal feeding tubes is not recom-mended because it may cause infection of nasal sinuses (Winter and Chang,1996), and the child's changed appearance during nasal tube feedings may be asource of added distress for the child and family.  Feeding tubes placed directlyinto the stomach or small intestine are more discrete and can easily be \"hidden\"Childrens Issues  6-44Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.   After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it. under a child's regular clothing. These tubes, called gastrostomy tubes or jejun-\nostomy tubes, are commonly used in children who will need to receive tubefeedings for an extended period of time.  The physician places the PEG (percu-taneous endoscopically placed gastrostomy tube) in a rather simple procedure.\nFeeding schedules, amounts and rates for enteral feeds are based upon a careful\nassessment of the child's overall health, with particular attention to the child'sability to tolerate the feeding.   Tube feedings may be either continuous orintermittent.  Continuous feedings are given at slow rates over many hours. Inbolus feedings a larger volume of liquid nutrition is given intermittently butover a short time. When first starting to tube feed a child the continuous methodis better tolerated.  Once the child has shown good toleration of continuousfeeds at the full volume needed, a change may be made to intermittent or bolusfeedings. Bolus feedings allow the child to have greater freedom of movementand independence since the feeding pump can be disconnected when not in use.\nThere are many factors to consider when selecting a tube feeding nutritional\nproduct.  It is important to consider the child's developmental status, nutritionalstatus and overall health when selecting a nutritional product. (Lingard, 1993)If there is a history of food allergy or intolerance select a product which doesnot contain the offending agent. Additional product characteristics to be consid-ered include nutrient composition, (type of carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitaminsand minerals), nutrient density  (number of calories, protein, etc. per volume)and osmolarity (the number of particles per volume). Products with a highosmolarity may cause diarrhea in some children and are seldom used wheninitiating tube feedings.\nHealth care professionals and families need to monitor tube feedings for tolera-\ntion and trouble shooting problems once enteral feedings have been initiated.The prevention of dehydration is quite important.\nChildren can be fed safely and effectively by tube if proper attention is paid to\nthe prevention of complications.  Complications may include mechanical,infectious, nutritional, metabolic, gastrointestinal, and developmental problems.Reference sources are available to assist health care professionals and familieswith troubleshooting enteral feeding problems. (Lingard, 1993) In order toavoid contamination, it is important that caretakers use safe preparation tech-niques.  These techniques include hand washing before initiating tube feedings,washing the top of the enteral product can before opening, using a clean punch-type can opener if a self-opener is not provided, cleaning feeding bags withChildrens Issues  6-45Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.   After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it. warm, soapy water between usage and limiting formula hangs to 8 hours.\nPlanning for home enteral support should include adequate training for parents,\nback-up caretakers and, as developmentally appropriate, the child.  All caretak-ers must be given hands-on training in using all equipment, show skill in man-aging tube feedings, and receive support to express concerns and misgivings.All supplies must be delivered to the home prior to hospital discharge.  Caretak-ers must also receive instruction on handling emergencies and be given tele-phone numbers for key personnel.\nChildren and parents may have difficulty expressing their fears about tube\nfeedings.  A supportive environment should be created which encourages allfamily members to express their feelings and concerns.  The nutrition planshould address all family concerns.\nParenteral Nutrition (PPN/TPN)Parenteral nutrition is an accepted method for providing the nutrients children\nneed to grow and thrive.  Parenteral or intravenous nutrition is used when achild can not safely or adequately take in foods by mouth or tube feedings.Severe failure to thrive or weight loss greater than 10% is a general reason forthe use of parenteral nutrition. (Cox, 1993)  Other reasons for using parenteralnutrition in children with HIV-related conditions include: wasting syndrome,acute or chronic intractable diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disorders, severebrain disorders, heart muscle loss, liver failure and infection.   Peripheralparenteral nutrition (PPN) involves the use of a peripheral vein and may be usedwhen short-term (less than 5 days) nutritional therapy is anticipated.(Cox, 1993)Total peripheral nutrition (TPN) with a centrally placed catheter may be usedwhen longer term intravenous nutritional care is expected.  Although placing acentral venous catheter in a child who is severely immunocompromised hassome risks, children with HIV disease have safely received long term home andhospital based TPN.\nThe TPN mixture is designed to provide adequate amounts of calories (as\ncarbohydrates, protein and fat), protein, fat, vitamins, minerals, trace elements,electrolytes and fluid for the child's growth.  Close monitoring of growth, fluidstatus, blood sugar, electrolytes, and other laboratory values are required.Guidelines for monitoring pediatric parenteral nutrition and handling metaboliccomplications are available.

Once the TPN regimen is stable and well tolerated, it is advisable to attempt\ncycling the TPN off for as many hours as possible, preferably during the day.Cycling allows the child to be free of the pump and related devices for part ofthe day.  During the free hours the child is more able to play and participate inregular child activities.\nAs soon and as much as possible, the child should be allowed to eat or re-start\ntube feeds.  Infants and young children on prolonged TPN often lose interest ineating and lose feeding skills. (McCoy, 1991) If the child cannot eat, an occupa-tional or speech therapist should be enlisted to create with the child and family aprogram to stimulate oral motor development.\nAs in enteral feedings, children and their families are often distressed by\nchanges in body image and freedom of movement associated with parenteralnutrition.  Care should be taken to address these concerns. Clothing can beselected to disguise the feeding tubes.  Portable feeding pumps and backpackscan be obtained.  Feeding schedules can be re-arranged to meet the child or thefamily\u2019s lifestyle.  Sometimes arranging a meeting between families consideringTPN and families currently using TPN can provide mutually helpful peersupport.Childrens Issues  6-47Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

For the Clinician #4\nComplimentary Therapies:\nVitamin/Mineral Supplementation and Herbal\nRemedy Usage with Children\nThe use of alternative or complementary medicine is increasing among thegeneral United States population.  Complementary nutritional therapies mayinclude nutritional practices that enhance or substitute for foods taken bymouth.  Some of these practices are proven to be safe and effective under propersupervision and are part of traditional standards of care. Non-standard nutri-tional practices are poorly documented in medical literature, may or may not besafe and are not proven to be effective.  Two unproved and potentially unsafepractices are vitamin and mineral megadosing and use of herbal remedies.Although several studies have looked at complementary nutritional therapyusage among adult men and women living with HIV disease, (Vogl D, et al.,1998; Johnston et al., 1998) no published studies have looked at parent's use ofcomplementary therapies with their children.\nVitamin/Mineral SupplementationMegadosing or taking more than 200% of the Recommended Dietary Allow-\nances for vitamins and minerals, unless prescribed and monitored by a physi-cian, may be harmful to the child and is not recommended. Limited research hasbeen done on vitamin and mineral insufficiencies in children with HIV disease.One study found that few HIV positive children had deficiencies in vitaminsand minerals. (Henderson, 1997) Chronic diarrhea, a common problem inchildren with HIV disease, has been found to lead to lower levels of magnesiumand zinc in infants. (Castillo-Duran et al, 1988; Rothbaum, 1982) Severalnutrients play key roles in immune function, including vitamin A, vitamin E, B-6, B-12, folate, selenium and zinc. (Liang et al., 1996)\nIncreased intake of the antioxidants beta-carotene, vitamin E and vitamin C may\nalso be helpful. (Mastroiacoro, et al., 1996)  Studies of adults with HIV diseasehave shown decreased serum levels of many of these same nutrients. (Baum,1997)  Decreased iron stores are associated with certain anti-viral medications.\nFor children living with HIV disease, practitioners routinely recommend a daily\nsingle dose supplement that provides 100% of the RDA for vitamins withadditional iron and zinc. Close monitoring of the child's iron status should beChildrens Issues  6-51Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.   After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it. done by health care providers to determine the need for additional iron supple-\nmentation. Blood tests to measure vitamin stores should be done on an asneeded basis.\nSome parents give their children vitamin and mineral enhanced tonics in an\neffort to promote growth and improve immune function.  While some of thesetonics may be harmless, others are not designed for children and may containharmful solvents (e.g. alcohol) or toxic doses of vitamins.  Parents are advisednot to give tonics to children unless approved by their pediatrician.\nGlutamine is an amino acid found in abundance in the body.  It has many uses\nincluding energy, protein metabolism, and helping the body get rid of excessammonia.  Glutamine supplementation has been suggested to be helpful inpreserving muscles in stressed patients, improving the body's immune system,and helping the intestines work properly. (Vanderhulst, et al., 1993;Hammarquist et al., 1989, Shabert and Wilmore, 1996)  Glutamine has beenused by both adult and pediatric patients with chronic diarrhea.  No publishedguidelines exist for routine glutamine supplementation in children with HIVdisease.\nHerbal Remedies and ChildrenHerbal remedies are one form of complementary medicine. The use of herbs for\nmedicinal purposes is commonplace among many social, ethnic and nationalitygroups. Food seasonings, such as ginger and garlic, may also be consumed forhealth purposes. When used in the amounts typically required to season foods,these herbs are regarded as safe for children as well as adults.  Recent immi-grants often have considerable experience using herbal remedies that are viewedas outside of mainstream medicine in the United States. No data exist on the useof herbal remedies in the pediatric HIV population.\nIt is important for parents and medical providers to maintain open communica-\ntion regarding the use of herbal remedies.  Little is known about the safety andeffectiveness of most herbal remedies. Some of them seem to enhance or pre-vent the body's use of  other medications.  Herbs that increase the potency ofother medicines may cause severe illness.  Herbs that interfere with the body'sabsorption of anti-viral medicines may allow the HIV virus to multiply.Childrens Issues  6-52Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children\n  Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.   After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it. One popular herb, Echinacea, has been shown to increase viral replication.\nAnother popular herb, St. John's Wort, has been shown to reduce drug levels ofthe protease inhibitor, indinavir.  Because of how St. John's Wort is metabolized,the FDA has recommended that it not be used with any protease inhibitor ornon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.\nA cause of concern with the use of herbs is our lack of information on the\nconcentration of active ingredients in these products. Also, there is no agree-ment on appropriate dosages for children or adults.  Children are at high riskbecause their bodies are small and their livers are not fully developed.  Mal-nourished children are at even higher risk when exposed to harmful products.Families considering use of any complementary or herbal remedy for their childare encouraged to first discuss their plans with their medical provider.\nFor more information see References (Section 11) .Assessment Formulas\nAssessment Formulas Tables and Charts 7-1NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT FORMULAS\nA complete nutritional assessment should ideally include not only a diet history, but\nseveral measurements which will provide a more sensitive and accurate assessment ofa client\u2019s nutritional status.  In addition, these measurements are useful indicators ofchanges in nutritional status.\nBODY SIZE\nWeight\nA measurement of total body weight is often the only measurement available to\ndetermine changes.  Weight measurements should be done routinely at each and\nevery visit and be recorded.   In order to ensure accuracy, the same scale should be\nused and calibrated regularly.\nWeight graphing provides an excellent visual assessment and may provide clinical\nindications of changing health status.\nTo convert weight in pounds to kilograms: Divide the weight in pounds by 2.2.\nTo convert kilograms to pounds: Multiply the number of kilograms by 2.2.\nIdeal Body Weight (IBW)\nThis measurement is useful for comparing a person\u2019s current (actual) weight against a\nrecommended weight based on height.  The Metropolitan Life Insurance Tables(1983) are the most recent tables available.\nIBW can also be calculated:\nMale: 106 pounds + 6 X number of inches over 5 feet tallFemale: 100 pounds + 5 X number of inches over 5 feet tall\nIn addition, a 10% plus/minus provision is also included to allow for variations in\nframe size providing a weight range for good health.  Typically, when an individual isbelow their IBW range fatigue, poor energy, and nutritional risk is obviously in-creased.\nCaution should be used in relying on IBW standards as a basis for determination of\nnutritional status since these standards have been developed using a healthy adultpopulation.Assessment Formulas\nAssessment Formulas Tables and Charts 7-2Adjusted Body Weight\nWhen someone is obese, that is, their body mass index (BMI) is over 30, instead of\nusing the person's current actual body weight to calculate caloric needs, use adjustedbody weight. (For BMI formula, see Page 7-6).\nAdjusted body weight  is calculated by using the following equation:\nActual Body Weight - Ideal Body Weight x .25 + Ideal Body Weight\nReference Body Weight (RBW)\nRBW may be used instead of ideal body weight.  RBW is the midpoint of the healthyweight range in the 1995 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  Within the healthy rangeRBW can be adjusted upward for more highly muscled and downward for lessmuscled individuals.\nUsual Body Weight (UBW)\nThis is the weight the client usually remembers.  The client should be asked what theyweighed most of their adult  life.  This is a crucial piece of information to obtain since\nmost people have never weighed within their IBW range.  In addition, weights for 6months ago and 1 year ago should also be asked and recorded.Expectations for weight management should be appropriately defined based on thisinformation.\nHeight\nThe actual height of the client should always be measured at the first visit.  Clientsoften report inaccurate heights which will affect determinations of IBW and poten-tially assessment of overall nutritional status.Balance beam scales usually have a height measuring device.  Another option is to usea measuring tape placed on the wall.To convert inches to centimeters: Multiply inches by 2.54.\nInstructions for Obtaining Height\nHeight should be measured without shoes.  With the client's back against the wall or\nmeasuring board, ask him or her to stand erect and to look ahead. The outer corner ofthe eye and top of the ear should be in line parallel to the floor.  Heels, scapula, andbuttocks should touch the wall.\nA right-angle headboard should be lowered to rest flat at the crown of the client's\nhead.  Height should be read to the nearest inch or .5 cm.Assessment Formulas\nAssessment Formulas Tables and Charts 7-3BODY COMPOSITION\nIt has been widely agreed that the ability to maintain lean body mass, or muscle tissue\ncan and will influence the overall health of an individual infected with HIV .  There isa strong correlation between loss of muscle mass and serious illness.  It is thereforeimportant to monitor changes in body composition that influence nutritional status.\nTriceps, Skinfold and Mid-upper Arm Circumference\nTriceps skinfold (TSF) thickness measures the amount of subcutaneous body fat.Approximately 50% of total body fat is subcutaneous. TSF is one of the skinfold sitesfound to be most reflective of body fatness. Changes in TSF are estimated to take 3-4weeks.  Formulas using mid-upper arm circumference (MAC) and TSF provideindirect assessment of the arm muscle area and arm fat area.\nInstructions for measuring triceps skinfold:\n\u2756Do not take skinfold measurements after the person has exercised, swam, or\n   showered since skinfold thickness will be increased due to increased blood flow to   the skin.\u2756The caliper needle should be on zero before starting the procedure.\n\u2756The point at which the skinfold measurement is taken is the same point used for\n   mid-arm circumference.  This point is halfway between the acromion process of the   scapula and the tip of the elbow.  Mark this point with a felt pen or adhesive label.\u2756Always take skinfold measurements (not only triceps skinfold) on the right side of\n   the body.\u2756The person should be sitting or standing with arms relaxed, hanging at their side.\n\u2756At the marked site on the triceps, grasp a vertical fold of the skin and underlying fat\n   between the thumb and index finger, 1 cm above the midpoint.  The skinfold should   be parallel to the length of the arm.  Both the thumb and the index finger should be   8 centimeters apart from the midpoint mark. Place the caliper just below the thumb   and index finger.\u2756The hand grasping the skinfold should hold the fold while the caliper is being used\n   to measure.\u2756Take the measurement 2 seconds after full pressure of the caliper is applied.  Three\n   measurements should be taken and the average value used.\u2756Always open the caliper prior to removing from the skinfold.\n\u2756Do not use plastic calipers.  They lack adequate tension.\nFor resources and more information on technique, calculations, interpretation and\nequipment, see References (Section 10).Assessment Formulas\nAssessment Formulas Tables and Charts 7-4Use and Interpretation of Skinfold Measurements\nIndirect methods of measuring subcutanious fat, total body fat and somatic proteins\n(skeletal protein mass) include skin fold measurements.  Special equipment requiredincludes a skinfold caliper.\nGood clinical skill and judgment is a critical element in obtaining and interpreting\nskinfold data.  The thickness of skinfolds gives an estimation of subcutaneous fat andstored energy. The most common skinfold site is over the triceps muscle.  This mea-surement is taken with calipers on the right arm midway between the olecranonprocess and the acromial process (midway between the shoulder and the elbow).  Themost common approach to interpreting Tricep Skinfold (TSF) results are to comparethem to percentile values for age and gender.  In general, patients are considered to bemalnourished if the TSF is at the 5th percentile or below, and to be at risk if the TSFis between the 5th and 15th percentiles.\nDepletion can be a reflection of poor oral intake or nutrient deprivation.  Serial mea-\nsurements are useful in evaluating changes in subcutaneous fat or somatic proteinmass in patients whose weight remains normal.\nA major drawback to these measurements is that they are chiefly used to detect over-\nweight; percentile tables have been established based on healthy populations.  Inaddition, the measurements are relatively imprecise unless the same person does themeasurements each time and has good technique.\nEstimation of Somatic Protein Stores\nMidarm muscle circumference (MAMC) and midarm muscle area (MAMA) may becalculated from TSF and mid-arm circumference (MAC) using the following equa-tions:\nMAMC(cm) = MAC(cm) - 0.314 X TSF(mm)MAMA(mm\n2) = (MAC(cm) - 3.14 TSF(mm)2\n 4 X 3.14\n*where MAC and TSF are in mm.\nThe results provide an indication of muscle mass.  Reference standards for age and\ngender are commonly available.Assessment Formulas\nAssessment Formulas Tables and Charts 7-5Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)\nThe three-compartment model of body composition allows for monitoring shifts in\nfluids and muscle. In this model the body is divided into three parts:\n1. Body Cell Mass (BCM): The most metabolically active tissue compartment made\n    up of highly functional protein stores e.g. muscle, organs and circulating cells.2. Extracellular Tissue (ECT):  Bone, plasma, collagen\n3. Fat Mass:  Fat stores\n\u2756 When BCM is increased or decreased the changes are mostly attributed to muscle\n    tissue changes.\u2756 When ECT is increased or decreased it may be due to fluid shifts.\n\u2756 Note BIA parameters at initial assessment and monitor changes over time to give\n    you a more accurate estimation of the individual's muscle and fat mass. See sample    BIA Screening Flow Sheet, (Page 8.7).\u2756 Note and review BIA results on a special form for the client.  See BIA Results\n    form, (Page 7-7).\nEvaluation of Body Cell Mass (BCM) using BIA\n\u2756 Ideal body cell mass (IBCM) is estimated by multiplying an individual's ideal body\n    weight by one of the following factors:\n           0.42 for adult males\n           0.32 for adult females\u2756 Comparing the individual's current BCM to the IBCM (CBCM/IBCM) is helpful in\n    evaluation and developing nutrition goals and appropriate interventions.\u2756 It is generally accepted that more than one BIA test is necessary to establish a\n    baseline, identify a trend in body composition, and provide the basis for starting or    changing therapy.\u2756 BIA is not sensitive enough alone to identify body shape changes seen in\n    \"lypodystrophy syndrome\".  Waist-hip and mid-arm circumference measurements    are more useful.\nBIA Equipment\n\u2756 BIA machines are available in single or multiple frequencies. Prices range from\n    $600 to $2000 for single frequency machines, and start at $5000 for multiple    frequency devices.\u2756 Some are programmed to just read out raw data or direct measurements of\n    impedance, resistance, reactance, and phase angle, and make available software    enabling users to input their own equations.\u2756 Some devices use proprietary equations for calculating fat, body cell mass and\n    other components and are less flexible in the user\u2019s ability to manipulate equationsAssessment Formulas\nAssessment Formulas Tables and Charts 7-6    and software applications.\nFor more information and links about BIA and equipment, see References (Section 10).\nBody Mass Index (BMI)\nBMI is an estimation of fat versus lean in body composition.  It has been demonstrated to\nhave a relatively high correlation with estimates of body fatness.  BMI assesses aperson\u2019s weight status as simply being underweight, average weight or overweight basedon height.\nBMI =\nWeight (kg)\nHeight (meters2)\nBMI is not a sensitive measurement for HIV .

Themost common formula used is the Harris-Benedict formula. Factors which consider levelsof activity and stress such as illness or trauma are added to the BEE to estimate totalcalorie needs.  The following are commonly used formulas for estimating energy require-ments.BEE represents the amount of energy expended when the body is at complete rest. BEEvaries with age, gender and body size.\nMen: BEE =  66.47 + (13.75 X W) + (5 X H) - (6.76 X A)\nWomen:     BEE = 65.51 + (9.56 X W) + (1.85 X H) - (4.68 X A)\nW = Weight in kg       A = Age in years     H = Height in cm\nActivity Factor: 1.3 Normal\n1.2 If confined to bed\nStress Factors: 1.2 Maintenance - Well, feeling good\n1.5 Sick - Fever, not doing well1.75 Very Sick - Major illness with multiple\n        Opportunistic Infections (OI)\nNonprotein Calorie Requirements = BEE X Activity Factor X Stress Factor\nRecommendations for the estimation of calorie needs for people living with HIV must be\nindividualized.  The Harris Benedict Equation underestimates the energy needs of adultsliving with HIV by approximately 13%.  Clinicians can consider adding a 1.13 stress factorwhen using this equation to estimate energy requirements for individuals with HIV infec-tion.\nIn general, calculate a minimum daily intake of 16 calories for each pound of baseline\nweight before infection or wasting for men and 13-14 calories for each pound of weight inwomen.\nEstimating Protein Requirements\nProtein requirements may increase to 1-1.5 grams/kilogram/body wight.  To maintain\nbody protein stores, highter levels than normal (0.8 grams/kilogram body weight) may berequired. (1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds). 7-10 Tables and ChartsHIV Medications and Nutritional Complications\nHIV Guide to Food ChoicesNutritional Side Effects of Selected Medications\nThe purpose for taking potent combination antiretroviral drugs is to suppress HIV\nreplication, keeping viral load as low as possible for as long as possible.  These drugshave been able to keep people healthier than before.

Disease activity is characterized by persis-\ntent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL).  The client is asymptomatic and does notexperience complications affecting medical, nutrition, or functional health status.The primary goal of medical nutrition therapy is preservation of lean body mass,prevention of weight loss, and maintenance of nutrition health status.\nLevel of Care 2:  HIV/AIDS Symptomatic but Stable\nClients have symptoms attributed to HIV infection or have a clinical condition that\nis complicated by HIV.  Disease activity is managed and symptoms are controlled.Impact on medical, nutrition, and functional health status is manageable.   Theprimary goal of medical nutrition therapy is maintenance of weight, lean bodymass, and managing symptoms and side effects associated with medical treatment.\nLevel of Care 3:  HIV/AIDS Acute\nClients have acute signs and symptoms of AIDS-defining conditions as a result of\ndisease progression.  Medical, nutrition and functional health status is being af-fected.  Clients may be hospitalized or frequency of outpatient visits may increase.The primary goal of medical nutrition therapy is maintaining weight, preservinglean body mass, preventing further weight loss, and managing symptoms and sideeffects of medical treatment.\nLevel of Care 4:  PalliativeClients have active disease progression, with care emphasis on the last stages of\nlife. Medical, nutrition and functional health status is compromised.  Clients caremay be provided in the home setting, or in a residential care or long term carefacility.  In some instances hospitalization may be required.  The primary goal ofmedical nutrition therapy is alleviation of symptoms while providing nutritiontreatment that maintains hydration status and supports the client through the dyingprocess.\n1Levels of Care based upon criteria established by HIV/AIDS Dietetic Practice Group of The American Dietetic Association,\n 1998.8 -11ALGORITHMS FOR NUTRITIONAL CARE\nAlgorithmsGuidelines for Medical Nutrition Therapy1\nGuideline 1:  Starting baseline medical nutrition therapy\nWithin one to six months after an HIV positive diagnosis, the patient should\nreceive as a baseline, a comprehensive nutrition assessment, self-managementtraining, nutrition education, and appropriate recommendations and interventionfollowing the HIV/AIDS Medical Nutrition Therapy Protocol. \u0000  HIV/AIDS\nmedical nutrition therapy includes analysis of dietary history and intake, height,weight, pre-illness usual weight, lean body mass and fat.  Skinfold calipers andmeasuring tape, DEXA, bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) or other compa-rable means can assess lean body mass and fat.\nAppropriate nutritional lab assessments, such as CBC, lipid panel, blood sugar\nand liver function tests should be done to identify and provide interventionstrategies for clinical manifestations of drug toxicities and underlying abnor-malities, such as anemia, vitamin depletion, diabetes mellitus, hypertension andother medical conditions.\nGuideline 2:  Referring for ongoing medical nutrition therapyAfter receiving a baseline nutrition assessment, the patient should receive\nregular and ongoing HIV/AIDS medical nutrition therapy.  This should occur:\u2756 With asymptomatic HIV infection, at least one to two times per year.\n\u2756 With HIV symptoms or an AIDS diagnosis, at least two to six times per year.\n\u2756 When there is new nutrition related clinical developments.\n\u2756 As needed for ongoing nutrition related clinical complications.\n\u2756 If necessitated by the clients ability to understand and incorporate nutrition\n    management skills.\n1Guidelines and Protocol of Care for Providing Medical Nutrition Therpay to HIV-Infected Persons:  Standards of Care\nCommittee.

It is vital that your primary care provider be aware and havethe opportunity to discuss any other treatments that you are thinking about using.\nConsider the source. For example, one in ten Internet sites dealing with gastrointestinal\nproblems have been found to be \u201cunproven or outright quackery.\u201d Commercial sites sellingproducts or therapies were found less reliable than sites run by the government, universi-ties or medical centers. Today due to popular demand, more and more medical centers andhealth care payers have begun to offer some \u201calternative therapies.\u201d This means that bothpatients and providers will learn more about what \u201calternative\u201d treatments can and cannotdo.\nAIDS Health Fraud\nAIDS health fraud is any false, misleading or unproven claim about the cure, treatment orprevention of HIV/AIDS.\nAIDS fraud can be dangerous. Fraudulent products are not properly tested and may harm\nyou, and they could even kill you. Fraudulent products waste your money, and healthinsurance usually doesn\u2019t pay for them.\nIf you use products or treatments that don\u2019t work, you may delay getting proper care and\nyour illness may get worse. There are legitimate treatments that extend and improve thequality of life for people living with HIV/AIDS.\nMany people with HIV/AIDS look for additions or alternatives to conventional medical\ntreatment for their disease. Some of these treatments may help people with HIV , whileothers have no effects, or they are harmful. You need to be careful and go over any alterna-tive treatments with your health care provider, pharmacist, or Registered Dietitian orNutritionist to see if it is right for you. BE AWARE!\nBackground Information   9-1Ask questions:\n1.  Safety: Is the product or treatment harmful?\n2.  Are there harmful drug-drug interactions with prescriptive and over-the-counter     medications and/or nutrients?3.  Are unproven treatments being used, while delaying effective conventional treatment(s)     and possibly missing important windows of opportunity?4.  Does the therapy work?5.  Is the financial expense worth the benefit?\nPay attention and be wary when you come across these \u201cwarning flags\u201d promoting a\nproduct or service:\n1.  It is THE cure or gives \u201cmiraculous\u201d results.\n2.  You are told not to use any other treatment.3.  The physician (or researcher) is the ONLY one with the answer.4.  It costs a lot.5.  Testimonials are the main source of information     about the therapy.6.  The FDA or the AMA is persecuting the treatment or the practitioner.7.  The ingredients are a secret.\nMedWatch\nReport any adverse effects of medical foods, dietary supplements, infant formulas, anddrugs to your doctor and to MedWatch, the FDA Medical Products Reporting Program.MedWatch reporting forms can be obtained and reports can be made by phone:1-800-FDA-1088 or via the Internet: www.fda.gov/medwatch. You will be asked to pro-vide:\n1.  Name, address and telephone number of the person who became ill.\n2.  Name and address of the doctor or hospital providing medical treatment.3.  Description of the problem.4.  Name of the product and store where it was bought.Background Information\nBackground Information  9-2Registered Dietitians\nRegistered dietitians (RDs) are health care professionals who have completed academic\nand experience requirements established by the Commission on Dietetic Registration, thecredentialing agency for the American Dietetic Association (ADA). This includes a mini-mum of a bachelor\u2019s degree granted by a U.S. regionally accredited college/university, orequivalent, and an accredited preprofessional experience program. RDs demonstrate theirknowledge of food and nutrition by successfully passing a national credentialing exam andby completing ongoing continuing professional development. Find a Registered Dietitianat www.eatright.org.\nThe HIV/AIDS Dietetic Practice Group (DPG) was established to enable members of the\nAmerican Dietetic Association across the country to network and share information,collaborate, and advocate having a positive impact on people affected by HIV/AIDS.http://www.hivaidsdpg.org/\nHIV knowledgeable registered dietitians work with and are referred by primary care\npractitioners to provide early and ongoing medical nutrition therapy. Goals and benefits ofmedical nutrition therapy in HIV care include: to optimize adequate intake of nutrients,preserve weight and lean body mass, minimize side effects, coordinate foods, meal andmedication schedules to optimize drug levels and reduce risk of drug resistance, andevaluate complementary therapies.\nRegistered dietitians are licensed or certified by the majority of states. Reimbursement\nvaries by state and health insurance plan. Diabetes self-management and training is nowunder Medicare Part B.\nFor more information:The American Dietetic Association\n216 W Jackson BlvdChicago, IL 60606-69951-800-877-1600Background Information\nBackground Information  9-3Complementary and Alternative Therapies\nAcupressure\nAcupressure is thought to be one of the oldest healing methods in the world. Fingertip\npressure is put on certain points on the body to help balance the flow of energy. This flow ofenergy creates a healthy function of the internal organs and helps prevent or cure disease.Acupressure is used to relieve headaches, back pain, and other ailments. Acupressurists maybe licensed, registered or certified depending on the State. Insurance coverage may beavailable.\nFor more information:American Massage Therapy Association\n820 Davis St. Suite 100Evanston, IL60201(847) 864-0123\nAcupunctureAcupuncture is a way of adjusting the body\u2019s \u201clife energy\u201d (chi) flow. It uses small needles\nthat are inserted into the skin in carefully chosen points in the body. Treatments may includethe use of herbs or other supplements as well. Acupuncture can be used to relieve symptomsas well as to promote general health and well being. Acupuncturists are licensed in someStates. They can be medical doctors or other health care professionals. At this timetwenty-two States license, certify or register acupuncturists, and many insurance companiesare now offer acupuncture as part of covered services.\nFor more information:American Academy of Medical Acupuncture Patient Referral Line\n5820 Wilshire Blvd. Suite 500Los Angeles, CA 90036(800) 521-2262\nAyurvedaAyurveda is a wholistic system of medicine originating in India thousands of years ago. It\nprovides guidance about food and lifestyle so that healthy people can stay healthy and folksBackground Information\nBackground Information  9-4Background Informationwith health challenges can improve their health. Ayurvedic medicine is validated by obser-\nvation, inquiry, direct examination and knowledge derived from the ancient texts.\nThe underlying principle is identification and treatment of a person\u2019s make-up. The body is\nmade up of tissues (dhatus), waste products (malas), and doshas (loosely translated toEnergetic Forces). The energetic forces that influence nature and human beings are calledTrishodas. The Tridoshas influence all movements, all transformations, all sensory func-tions, and many of the other activities in the human body and mind, and are made up ofvarying amounts of three doshas: vata, pitta, kapha. Each dosha consists of the basic ele-ments, earth, air, fire, water and space. Methods of practice and treatments include Yoga,vigorous exercise, stretching, breathing exercises, meditation, massage, herbal treatmentsand the use of cleansing and detoxification. Methods are generally non-invasive andnon-toxic and rely on the person\u2019s willingness to take part in a healthier way of life.Ayruvedic medicine is not appropriate for treating serious injuries. Ayurvedic practitionersare not licensed to practice in the United States.\nFor more information:Ayruvedic Institute\n11311 Menaul NE, Suite AAlbuquerque, NM 87112(505) 291-9698\nChiropracticChiropractors represent the second largest group of primary care providers in the United\nStates after physicians. There are fourteen colleges in the US accredited by the Council onChiropractic.\nKey Principles:\u2756 The human organism can keep itself healthy if there are no barriers to full expression of\n    all its vital functions.\u2756 The body has the ability to heal itself from within.\n\u2756 The life force of the person flows throughout the body through the nervous system.\n\u2756 By manipulating the spine and other joints which the nervous system flow through, the\n    chiropractor can remove barriers to let the full energy of this life force to be released.Background Information\nBackground Information  9-5Chiropractors do not directly treat disease but rather help the body to restore itself. Many\ninsurance companies now cover the cost of chiropractic care. Some managed health careplans include chiropractic care. Chiropractors are licensed in every state. They must pass anexamination with the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners.\nFor more information:World Chiropractic Alliance\n2950 N. Dobson Rd. Suite 1Chadler, AZ 85224(800) 347-1011\nHomeopathyHomeopathy aims to help the body heal itself. It uses the philosophy that \u201ca substance that\ncauses symptoms of illness in a well person can also be used to cure similar symptomswhen they result from illness\u201d. Homeopathy uses remedies to \u201cprovoke\u201d or challenge\u201d theperson\u2019s vital force so that it will bring all the body\u2019s systems to a higher level of order.There is no national standard or certification to determine if a homeopath is competent.Insurance coverage varies among the States.\nFor more information:The National Center for Homeopathy\n810 N. Fairfax St. #306Alexandria, V A 22314(703) 548-7790\nNaturopathyNaturopaths are trained in a four year accredited program. They are trained with the focus\non preventive medicine and natural therapies. They are licensed in only 13 States andinsurance coverage varies by State and individual insurance policy.\nPhilosophy of naturopathy:  The body has the power to heal itself, so treatment should not\nbe given to alleviate symptoms but to support the self-healing mechanisms, the \u201cvitalforce\u201d.  The symptoms of disease are not part of the disease itself but a sign that the body istrying to get rid of toxins and return to a natural state of balance.  In addition to being asnatural and gentle as possible, all treatments should take into account the mental, emotional,and social aspects of a person as well as the physical.Background Information\nBackground Information  9-6For more information:\nAmerican Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP)\n2366 Eastlake Ave., Suite 322Seattle, WA 98102\nTraditional Chinese MedicineThe philosophy of traditional Chinese medicine is prevention of disease, and the view that\nthe body is a reflection of the natural world. Chi (qi) or \u201clife force energy\u201d is the force thatmakes life happen and gives the body the ability to be active. Wellness is a function of abalanced flow of chi and illness or disease is the result of changes in the flow of chi.Wellness also needs the balance of yin and yang, that is, the dual nature of all things. SomeChinese medicine health care providers are also licensed medical doctors, and some areacupuncturists.

Ongoing research in HIVcontinues to indicate that there is an increased need for certain nutrients, as well as inad-equate intake, malabsorption, metabolic changes and changes in organ system function toaffect bioavailability of specific nutrients. Problems with over supplementation of a vitaminor mineral also continue to be reported.\nUntil there is wide spread agreement for supplementation beyond that of a basic multiple\nvitamin-mineral supplement and a low dosage B-complex, work with your doctor anddietitian to identify need for additional single nutrients.\nExamples of multiple vitamin-mineral supplements are:\u2756 AARP Alphabet II Multiplevitamins and Minerals Formula 643*\n\u2756 AARP Formula 683, Women\u2019s Formula*\n\u2756 Centrum Advanced Formula\n\u2756 Centrum Silver*\n\u2756 Nature Made Century-Vite\n\u2756 Nature Made Essential Balance\n\u2756 One A Day Men*,\n\u2756 Theragram M\nThe Daily Values (DVs) listed on labels of most food products and supplements can be used\nas a basic guide. DVs are made up of two sets of references, Daily Reference Values (DRV)and Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs). RDIs have replaced the term USRDA and representsthe estimated values for vitamins and minerals for individuals over 4 years of age.\nThe DVs are expected to change eventually to reflect revised Recommended Dietary Allow-\nances (RDAs) needed as determined by the National Academy of Science. Currently, insteadof publishing one report, they are producing 7 reports over a few years.\nThe Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is similar but different term. RDAs areBackground Information\nBackground Information  9-8nutrients needed for almost all healthy individuals in specific age and gender groups. In\nthe past it was to prevent deficiency, and now it is the recommended amount of nutrients todecrease the risk of chronic disease.\nTolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for the first time have been set. ULs are the maxi-\nmum intake by an individual that is unlikely to pose risk of adverse health effects inalmost all healthy individuals and in a specified group. These are not to be seen as arecommendation of intake\nAntioxidants are vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene and the mineral selenium. HIV\ninfection is believed to increase oxidative stress, which antioxidants may help. Recently itwas reported that decreasing viral load decreases oxidative stress.Background Information\nBackground Information  9-9Other Dietary SupplementsBackground Information\nBesides vitamins and minerals, dietary supplements include amino acids, fiber, herbal prod-\nucts and other substances.  Herbal products usually contain a very small amount of vitaminsand minerals.  These products usually contain a very small amount of vitamins and minerals.The value of products for general health is currently under study and standards for theirpurity, potency and composition are being developed.\nMaking choices may be confusing.  Health claims may appear promising, yet lack scientific\nevidence.  FDA protects the public from harmful or misleading ingredients, but it does notapprove food or dietary supplements.\nUse Caution!Many dietary supplements may act like drugs, interact with drugs and nutrients, may have\nside effects, and other concerns.  They may contain more or less than the ingredients listed,they may contain harmful contaminates intentionally or not.\nThe popular herb, St. John's Wort, commonly used for mild depression, was found to greatly\nreduce the drug levels of the protease inhibitor indinavir (Crixivan) and numerous otherdrugs.  This is an example of how little is known about dietary supplements and how theprescribing physician, pharmacist and dietitian should be informed of all dietary supplementsand medications being taken.\nThe chart shows some popular dietary supplements, some harmful and some promising.\nEach must be evaluated with your doctor prior to use.\nRemember to report adverse events to your doctor and to MedWatch either directly or\nthrough your doctor.

El comer alimentos saludables es especialmente importante para\npoder aumentar sus fuerzas f\u00edsicas para que usted pueda disfrutar de la vida lo m\u00e1s normalmenteposible cuando usted es VIH positivo. La buena nutrici\u00f3n es una coterapia que le puede ayudar\na llevar al m\u00e1ximo el manejo m\u00e9dico del VIH. Una nutrici\u00f3n agresiva puede prevenir o demorar lap\u00e9rdida de sus m\u00fasculos. Este es un proceso que se llama desgaste VIH. Los estudios demuestran quesu salud nutritiva es un factor importante que influye en la sobrevivencia del VIH. Actualmente nohay cura para el VlH/SIDA, pero usted puede afectar el proceso de la enfermedad y mejorar la calidad de\nsu vida manteniendo una actitud positiva y un estilo de vida saludable. Algunos de los cambios que usted\npuede hacer para tener un estilo de vida saludable incluyen: (1) seguir la intervenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica apropiada paratratar las infecciones; (2) escoger alimentos saludables; (3) manejar las tensiones de una manera positiva; (4)hacer ejercicios en forma regular, preferiblemente con pesas; y (5) integrar las terapias naturales y otrasterapias en el manejo de su plan de salud. Todas estas terapias trabajan juntas para ayudarle a su sistemainmunol\u00f3gico a combatir el VIH.\nLas personas con VIH/SIDA tienden a perder musculatura y las reservas de prote\u00ednas junto con\ndiferentes cantidades de p\u00e9rdida de grasas. Hay tres razones principales por las cuales usted puede perderpeso, experimentar p\u00e9rdida de los m\u00fasculos y como resultado desarrollar malnutrici\u00f3n relacionada al VIH. Sitiene poco apetito, es posible que no est\u00e9 comiendo suficiente prote\u00ednas, calor\u00edas, vitaminas y minerales que sucuerpo necesita; el metabolismo de su cuerpo se acelera cuando hay infecciones; y por esto usted necesitacalor\u00edas y prote\u00ednas adicionales en sus comidas para mantener su peso; y si usted tiene diarrea cr\u00f3nica, sucuerpo pierde calor\u00edas, prote\u00ednas, vitaminas y minerales.\nEs muy importante mantener su tejido muscular fuerte, para llevara cabo las funciones del cuerpo y\nayudarle a procesar los medicamentos. La meta primaria de la nutrici\u00f3n de las personas con VIH es\nagadurles a mantener y aumentar su peso muscular. Puede hacer esto comiendo comidas y tomando\nl\u00edquidos con muchas calor\u00edas para que su cuerpo no use su tejido muscular para extraer energ\u00eda durante lasinfecciones. Las siguientes comidas le d\u00e3 a su cuerpo energ\u00eda: almidones complejos y carbohidratos, az\u00facaressimples y grasas. Usted tambi\u00e9n necesita alimentos que le puedan proveer a su cuerpo con prote\u00ednas parapoder aumentar y mantener su musculatura. Puede escoger una combinaci\u00f3n de fuentes de prote\u00edna animal ouna combinaci\u00f3n de prote\u00edna vegetal que se puedan complementar, dependiendo de su preferencia. Tambi\u00e9nnecesita hacer ejercicios diarios y repetitivos para aumentar la fuerza muscular.\nEs bien importante el comer peque\u00f1as cantidades durante el d\u00eda, aun que no tenga hambre. Un plan de\ncomida alto en prote\u00ednas, y calor\u00edas, que incluya comidas altas en carbohidratos complejos, y que\nincluya cantidades moderadas de grasas es el mejor para poder prevenir el desgaste muscular con elVIH. Esto puede cambiar si usted tiene s\u00edntomas espec\u00edficos o alg\u00fan otro problema m\u00e9dico.
