Such encouragement, also by means \nof switching from the traditional paper prescription to \nthe current electronic one, has led to a wide spread in \nopioid prescription even among those medical special-\nities which never did before. Besides, new synthetic \nopioids with apparently less side effects, favourable \nkinetics and easer to take, might have arosen a wrong \nimpression of unreal harmlessness. Therefore, the \nincreased prescription and its obvious consequence \nof consumption has led to an alarming increase in \nthe number of side effects, proving our patients not \nto be so well controlled. We have perceived in our \nHealth Department several different patients with \nopioid consumption abuse derived from medical pre-\nscription with potential life threatening side effects, \nthat\u00b4s why we have conducted a medical path for their \ndetoxifi  cation.\nAim: To perform a safe fast opioid detoxification \n(FOD) in our fully monitored patients. \nMethod and materials:  To perform our FOD path \nwe previously admit the patients in our ICU unit. After \na careful clinical, psychological, social and biological \nassessment, and having requested their informed \nconsent, we monitor all their vital constants in bed \nand we start a deep polymodal sedation up to the \nrequired level for each patient, getting even ready \nfor oral intubation and mechanical ventilation if need-\ned. Our regular vital maintenance is based on fl  uids, \ndeep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, digestive prophy-\nlaxis, physiotherapy, urine output and blood tests \nfor 96 hours. Having achieved our goal, regard-\nRESUMEN   \nIntroducci\u00f3n: En estos \u00faltimos 15 a\u00f1os, el incremento \ndel uso de analg\u00e9sicos opioides ha sido progresivo y ele-\nvado. La percepci\u00f3n de la existencia de cuadros de dolor \nmal tratados ha provocado que muchos sistemas de salud \nincentiven a los profesionales en el uso de opioides, para \nevitar episodios de sufrimiento in\u00fatiles y est\u00e9riles. Dicha \nincentivaci\u00f3n, el uso de receta electr\u00f3nica, la facilitaci\u00f3n y \nsimpleza de prescripci\u00f3n tras la desaparici\u00f3n de receta de \nestupefacientes tradicional, supuso una liberalizaci\u00f3n signi-\nfi  cativa y uso de opioides progresivo entre todas las espe-\ncialidades m\u00e9dicas que habitualmente no los prescrib\u00edan. \nAdem\u00e1s, la aparici\u00f3n de nuevos opioides sint\u00e9ticos, con \naparentemente menores efectos secundarios, f\u00e1ciles de \nusar y con buen perfi  l farmacocin\u00e9tico, quiz\u00e1s ha suscitado \nuna confi  anza irreal en la inocuidad de dichos f\u00e1rmacos. \nEstos \u00faltimos a\u00f1os han sido a\u00f1os de alta prescripci\u00f3n \ny de hallazgo de efectos no deseados por los elevados \nconsumos y prescripciones un tanto quiz\u00e1 alejadas de la \nidoneidad y poco control sobre los pacientes. Nosotros \ndetectamos en nuestro departamento de salud varios \ncasos de pacientes con problemas reales derivados del \nconsumo de opioides, de origen iatrog\u00e9nico, siempre por \nprescripci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica legal y con grav\u00edsimos efectos secun-\ndarios, que conllevaban riesgo vital.\nObjetivo: Realizar una deshabituaci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida del consumo \nde opioides, sin poner en riesgo la salud y vida del paciente, \nde un modo rigurosamente monitorizado y controlado. \nMaterial y m\u00e9todos: Nuestra comunicaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfi  ca se \nbasa en la descripci\u00f3n del trabajo realizado sobre un grupo \nde pacientes afectados por un elevado consumo de opioides. \nNuestro m\u00e9todo de deshabituaci\u00f3n a los opioides consiste en \nel ingreso de los pacientes en la Unidad de Cuidados Intensi-\nvos del Servicio de Anestesiolog\u00eda de nuestro hospital para la \nretirada absoluta de los mismos.

Dependence refers to the imperative need to contin-\nue the use of opioids to avoid withdrawal syndrome, and \naddiction is defi  ned as a chronic and recurrent disease \nof the brain characterized by the pursuit and compulsive \nuse of substances despite their harmful consequences, \ninability to stop using the substance, neglecting work, \nsocial or family obligations and sometimes, depending \non the substance, tolerance and deprivation or with-\ndrawal.\nRisk factors associated with an increase in the inap-\npropriate use of opioid analgesics when prescribed for \nthe management of chronic pain, such as substance \nabuse disorder, family history of substance abuse, asso-\nciated mental illness, history of legal problems or jail \nsentences, white race and under 40-45 years of age, \nhave been described (5).\nIn the pain units, patients referred by other spe-\ncialties are treated. These patients are diagnosed of \nvarious pathologies, with chronic pain in general valued \nfrom moderate to severe, which in its evolution require INTRODUCTION\nThe use of long-term opioid therapy for non-can-\ncer chronic pain (NCCP) has increased signifi  cantly in \nrecent decades, as well as the subsequent introduction \nof rapid-release opioid formulations in these cases could \nhave produced an increase in cases of opioid addiction \nin patients with NCCP (1). The proportion of patients \nwith iatrogenic addiction to opioids is very diffi  cult to \nestimate due to the absence of defi  nitions and specifi  c \ncriteria for patients with chronic pain and opioid use (2).\nThe criteria used for the diagnosis of opioid con-\nsumption disorder (OCT) are based on the Diagnostic \nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), 5th \nedition (DSM-5) (3).\nThe DSM-5 defi  nes the opioid use disorder (OUD) as \na set of cognitive, behavioral and psychological symp-\ntoms that lead an individual to the continued use of a \nsubstance despite the problems related to its use (4).\nThe abuse of opioids produces alterations in brain \ncircuits, which are the underlying causes for the devel-\ning the patients are stable, they are discharged \nto the ward for an additional 48 hours period, \nwith psyquiatric treatment and under the care of the \nAddictive Conducts Unit. The patients are fi  nally dis-\ncharged from hospital with a multimodal supervision \nand treatment conducted by our Pain Unit, Addictive \nConducts Unit and Physical Rehabilitation.\nResults:  We describe the results achieved with two \ndifferent drug approaches which combine different phar-\nmacological groups frequently used for detoxifi  cation: \nmidazolam, propofol, ketamine, clonidine and nalox-\none, for our aim of succeeding in keeping the patients \nopioid-free without endangering their haemodynamic, \nbreathe or biology.\nConclusions:  FOD has proved to be a successful \ntreatment in rescuing the patients from a living hell \nout of which they would have found it impossible to \nleave without qualifi  ed help. We deem it safe with the \nright ICU surveillance, since no major complications \nhave occurred, but a thereafter following and help is \nmandatory, since, like any other patient attended at a \nPain Clinic, they require a favouring social and familiar \nenvironment to avoid any relapse. Finally, and given our \nresults, we consider this detoxifi  cation method right and \nsafe but highly costly in resources.\nKey words: Opioids, opioids abuse, fast opioid detoxi-\nfi  cation, FOD.\nuna retirada de los opioides, con monitorizaci\u00f3n avanzada \ne inicio de sedaci\u00f3n profunda multimodal, hasta el nivel que \nsea necesario para cada paciente, incluso con previsi\u00f3n de \nposible intubaci\u00f3n orotraqueal y asistencia ventilatoria.

These treatments can potentially \ncause addition symptoms. Therefore, an exhaustive \nfollow-up to detect the cases that could develop such \nsymptoms is required. This follow-up should be conduct-\ned by the professionals specialized in the treatment of \npain.\nOther important concepts to consider are tolerance \nand dependence. Tolerance is the state of adaptation in \nwhich an increase in the doses of the opioid is required \nto obtain the desired effect, or there is a decrease in \nthe effect of the substance over time (6).\nThe continued use of opioids for pain management \ncreates dependence. An alteration in the physiological \nresponse resulting from the adaptation of the opioid-re-\nceptor binding due to chronic use occur in the physical \ndependence on opioids. This chronic use is character -\nized by the presence of OWS occurring after abrupt \ncessation, rapid reduction, decrease in level of the drug \nin blood and/or the administration of an antagonist (7). \nIt is important to differentiate this term of addiction, \nwhich describes a chronic neurobiological disorder that \ninvolves an aberrant use of the opioid and a maladaptive \nsocial behavior that implies a loss of self-control that \nleads to compulsive and often self-destructive use (8).\nIn the present article we describe six cases of rap -\nid opioid detoxification (ROD) conducted in the recov-\nery unit of our hospital, between 2011 and 2016, of \npatients showing symptoms of opioids addiction.\nROD: DETOXIFICATION METHOD\nAll the patients had been diagnosed with neuropathic \npain, of years of evolution, with values > 7 regarding \npain intensity in the visual analogue scale (VAS), in which \ndifferent neuromodulators and opioids had been used \nfrom lower to higher, as indicated the World Health \nOrganization (WHO) analgesic ladder (Table I).\nThey are two women and four men aged 36-53 \nyears (in the year in which the ROD was performed) \nsocially integrated with relatives who supported them, \nand without medical history that contraindicated the \ndetoxification.\nAll the cases described in the present study were \ndiagnosed in the consultation of the Pain Unit at our \nHealth Department (220,000 inhabitants). Four of \nthem referred from primary care and after being treat-\ned in our unit and two of them after referral from pri-\nmary care with treatments already established by their \ngeneral practitioners.\nAll of them had a point in common, which consist-\ned in the use of fast-acting fentanyl for the treatment \nof non-cancer breakthrough pain some time before \nthey began to increase their care demands for its pre-\nscription, since its consumption was increasing not \nonly regarding the daily doses administered but also \nregarding the amount (micrograms) prescribed. This \nfact, together with the appearance of agitation and \naggressiveness in the consultations and the denial that \ntheir baseline treatment was effective, verified by the \nanesthesiologists, by our nurse who answers telephone \nconsultations in the PTU, as well as by the relatives, \nwere the symptoms that led us to diagnose the addic-\ntion syndrome and to suggest a solution (4).After the diagnosis of addiction syndrome (DSM-5 \nlevel 3, severe OUD), an appointment was booked for \neach patient that should be accompanied by a close \nrelative. They were thoroughly informed about the \naddiction the patient suffered and the possibility of \nentering the recovery unit, where patients would be \ntreated for a few days, the drugs that they would be \nusing, the monitoring of vital signs and the risks. All \n6 patients accepted and signed an informed consent \ntogether with their family member and an anesthesi-\nologist from our unit.\nMETHOD\nAll the patients were admitted in a fasted state in \nthe morning of a Monday. A peripheral vein was cathe-\nterized, a nasogastric (NG) tube and a urinary catheter \nwere placed and blood was collected for a baseline \nanalysis consisting of a blood count, biochemistry and \ncoagulation determinations.TABLE I\nDRUGS USED PRIOR TO THE ROD TREATMENT\nPacient 1Fentanilo TTS 125 mcg/72 h\nTramadol 50 mg/8  h\nPregabalina 150/12h\nDuloxetina 60/24 h\nFentanilo absorci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida  \n100 mcg/demanda\nPacient 2Hidromorfona 20 mg/24 h\nFentanilo absorci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida  \n400 mcg/demanda\nPacient 3Fentanilo TTS 100 mcg/72 h\nOxicodona/Naloxona 10 mg/12 h\nPregabalina 300 mg/12 h\nFentanilo absorci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida  \n400 mcg/demanda\nPacient 4Hidromorfona 16 mg/24 h\nDuloxetina 60 mg/24 h\nPregabalina 75 mg/12 h\nFentanilo absorci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida  \n400 mcg/demanda\nPacient 5Buprenorfina 70 mg/72 h\nPregabalina 150 mg/12 h\nFentanilo absorci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida  \n200 mcg/demanda\nPacient 6 Oxicodona/Naloxona 30 mg/12 h\nDuloxetina 30 mg/24 h\nFentanilo absorci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida  \n400 mcg/demanda98 M.

These four patients \nwere administered 150 mg 1 tablet NG clonidine every \n12h, SC enoxaparin every 24h at prophylactic doses for \ndeep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 40 mg IV omeprazole \nevery 24 hours. For the symptoms and signs expected \nin opioid withdrawal (Table III) (such as hypertension, \ndiarrhea, muscle-ages, vomiting, anxiety, etc.), we pro-\ntocolized the administration of labetalol, loperamide, \nparacetamol/desketoprofen and ondansetron, depend-\ning on the appearance of those symptoms and signs, \nas long as there were no individual contraindications \nfor their use.\nDexmedetomidine and midazolam were used for \nsedation during the detoxification process of the other \ntwo patients. Similarly, to the first four patients, propo-\nfol was used to increase the level of sedation only when \nthe signs of withdrawal began. Furthermore, patients \nalso underwent gastric protection, DVT prophylaxis with \nlow molecular weight heparin due to prolonged immo-\nbilization, but in the latter two cases clonidine was not \nused orally, because clonidine is a molecule acting at \nthe central nervous system on the same receptors as \ndexmedetomidine (9).\nAll patients, during the process, were assessed \nusing the rating scale of the opioids withdrawal syn-\ndrome (OWS) until signs of detoxification ceased \n(Table III) (10).\nRESULTS\nDoses used were always individualized according \nto the needs of each patient and in increasing doses, \naccording to their needs:\n\u2013  Midazolam: perfusion started from 0.05 to 0.1 \nmg/kg/h, reaching maximum doses of 7 mg/h.\n\u2013  Ketamine: started at 0.1 mg/kg/h and reached \nmaximum doses of 20 mg/h.\n\u2013  Dexmedetomidine: started at 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/h and \nreached doses of 1.4 \u03bcg /kg/h.\n\u2013  Propofol: started as needed by the patients and their \ndoses ranged from 1 mg/kg/h to 2 mg/kg/h.\nThe two patients treated with midazolam and dex-\nmedetomidine required perfusion of propofol between \n10 and 12 hours after the beginning of the detox-\nification process; while only one case out of the 4 \npatients treated with midazolam, ketamine and clon-\nidine did not require perfusion of propofol. Perfusion \nof propofol began later, between 30 and 36 h after \nthe beginning of the process of detoxification, in the \nother 3 patients.\nIn the 4 cases in which the sedation consisted of an \ninfusion of midazolam and ketamine, the signs of the TABLE II\nTREATMENT GROUPS STUDIED\nGroup A (n = 4) Group B (n = 2)\nMidazolam in CP\nKetamine in CP\n\u00b1 Propofol in CPMidazolam in CP\nDexmedetomidine in CP\n\u00b1 Propofol in CP\nClonidine 150 mg NG\nNaloxone 0.4 mg IV Naloxone 0.4 mg IVTABLE III\nOPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME (OWS) \nSCALE\nSymptoms (maximum 15 points):\n\u2013 Bone or joint aches\n\u2013  Cramps-paresthesia\n\u2013  Disthermia-chills\n\u2013 Stomach cramps\n\u2013  Nausea\n\u2013 Palpitations\n\u2013 Craving0-3\n0-3\n0-2\n0-3\n0-1\n0-1\n0-2\nSigns (maximum 33 points):\n\u2013  Anxiety (1) / irritability (2) /  \nrestlessness (3)\n\u2013 Yawning\n\u2013  Fever > 37.9\u00b0C\n\u2013  Tremors, muscle twitching\n\u2013 Vomiting\n\u2013 Diarrhea\n\u2013 Piloerrection\n\u2013 Sweating\n\u2013  Sneezing, running nose\n\u2013 Tearing\n\u2013  Tachypnea 20-30 breaths/min (1) /  \n> 30 breaths/min (2)\n\u2013  Tachycardia: 90-120 bpm (1)/ \n> 120 bpm (2)\n\u2013  High blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg (1) \n/ < 160/95 mmHg (2)\n\u2013  Mydriasis: mild (1) / moderate (2) / \nintense (3)1-2-\n3\n0-2\n1\n0-3\n0-2\n0-3\n0-3\n0-3\n0-2\n0-2\n1-2\n1-2\n1-2\n1-2-\n3\nTotal: \nScore of the OWS scale: mild OWS:  \n0 to 10 points; moderate OWS: 11 to  \n24 points; severe OWS: equal or above  \n25 pointsRAPID OPIOID DETOXIFICATION  99\nOWS were less marked than in the two cases in which \nwe used infusions of midazolam and dexmedetomidine. \nIn addition, the perfusion doses of propofol in the first \n4 cases were lower than in those patients of the mid-\nazolam-dexmedetomidine group (Table IV).\nBoth ketamine and dexmedetomidine infusions were \nnot maintained for more than 72 hours, and they were \nalways progressively reduced until discontinuation, \nmaintaining the perfusion of midazolam and propofol, \nwhich subsequently decreased gradually until discon-\ntinuation.\nRegarding the cessation of symptoms and signs of \nthe OWS, these occurred between 72 and 96 hours \nin all the cases studied. Then a dose of 0.4 mg IV \nnaloxone was administered and the responses of each \npatient were observed, without any of the cases show-\ning signs of opioid deprivation.\nThe length of the stay at the recovery unit was \nfive days for all patients, except for one case who \nstayed at the unit for 8 days. In the latter case, the \npatient was also addicted to nicotine and with a his-\ntory of moderate associated alcoholism. There was \nno case of respiratory depression or severe pain or \npsychomotor agitation that required intubation of the \npatient.\nThe patients are usually discharged on the fifth \nday to the conventional hospitalization ward, where \nthey stayed for 48 hours undergoing alternative treat-\nment, and monitored in case any type of complication \noccurs.\nAfter discharge, treatments with neuromodulators, \nolanzapine and in two cases also with THC (tetrahydro-\ncannabinol) in sublingual spray for crisis of neuropathic \npain began, in case.\nAll the patients, after the detoxification, were \nreferred to the unit of addiction behavior for following-up \nthe progress and continued with the periodic checkup \nin our unit.\nDISCUSSION\nOpioid addiction is a complex disease that is difficult \nto treat. The treatment is divided into three process-es: stabilization, detoxification and maintenance therapy \n(11). Stabilization consists in the substitution of the \nopioid for treatments that ensures that the use of the \ndrug is independent of the mental state and the cir -\ncumstances. Detoxification consists in the withdrawal \nof the opioid safely and effectively, minimizing the with-\ndrawal syndrome (with opioid receptor agonist drugs, \nsuch as methadone or buprenorphine or with agonists \nof alpha-2 adrenergic receptors such as clonidine or \ndexmedetomidine). Maintenance therapy consists of \nrelapse prevention (usually with the administration of \nopioid receptor antagonists, such as naloxone or nal -\ntrexone).\nThe problems that clinical experience has helped \nus to observe is that, since the introduction of treat-\nments outside of the data sheet (non-cancer patients) \nof the fast-acting fentanyls, the \u201cfascination\u201d that \nproduces the effect of the drug through areas of \nbrain stimulation (with great feeling of gratification) \nis greater than analgesia in at the beginning. This \nmeans that almost all of our non-cancer patients, \nincluded in the FOD program, tend to abandon the \nbaseline treatment, opioids, adjuvants, etc., in favor \nof performing analgesia mediated by the rapid opioid \nexclusively and in doses absolutely larger than those \nrecommended by their doctor, both in amount per \ndose and in frequency of them. In fact, this is the \nmain important recommendation we make: a com-\nprehensive pharmacotherapeutic follow-up of patients \nwho are treated with fast-acting fentanyl out of the \ndatasheet, as well as the performance of a pact of \ntime and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy while eval-\nuating other alternatives that would allow an early \nwithdraw of these drugs. In general, we can say that \nthe incidence of overdose and iatrogenic problems \nwith this fast-acting fentanyl is almost non-existent \nwhen prescribed and controlled from our Pain Unit, \nbut not when prescribed by other medical specialties, \nwith less knowledge of the problem generated by the \nchronic use of opioids.\nThe traditional management in the 1970s of this \nsyndrome implied either replacement by a long-acting \nopioid such as methadone and its subsequent gradual \nwithdrawal, or the non-use of opioids (clonidine with \nadjuvants such as analgesics, hypnotics and benzodi-\nazepines). Generally, in both processes, a mu-receptor \nantagonist such as naltrexone was gradually introduced \n(12,13). The rate of failure and relapse in both cases \nwas high due to the discomfort and distress that the \npatients experienced during the procedure. Therefore, \nin the 1980s, Loimer et al. (14) developed for the first \ntime this process of detoxification with general anesthe-\nsia and intubation, based on Yale University publications \n(15) on ROD methods.\nFrom then, different researchers have been introduc-\ning improvements and modifications to the ultra-ROD \ntechnique (16).\nStudies on the efficacy of gradual opioid withdrawal \nmethods using methadone or buprenorphine treatment \nversus new methods of ROD and ultra-ROD have not \nbeen able to demonstrate the clear benefits of one \ntechnique or another. Clinicians should be guided by the \nresponse of patients to determine the duration of the \nopioid withdrawal period (17).TABLE IV\nDOSES OF PROPOFOL USED\nGroup A (n = 4) Group B (n = 2)\nPropofol in PC:\n\u2013  Pacient 1:  \n0,6 mg/kg/h\n\u2013  Pacient 2:  \n0,8 mg/kg/h\n\u2013  Pacient 3:  \n1 mg/kg/h\n\u2013  Pacient 4: No se \nutiliz\u00f3 propofolPropofol in PC:\n\u2013  Pacient 1: \n1,7 mg/kg/h\n\u2013  Pacient 2:  \n1,6 mg/kg/h100 M.

It is not known exactly by \nwhich mechanisms anesthetic agents are able to \nblock the expression of opioid withdrawal, but one of \nthe explanations could be in the interference of these \ndrugs with glutamate, which is closely associated with \na noradrenergic hyperactivity that in part is behind \nthe pathophysiology of the withdrawal syndrome (19).\nThe efficacy results for ultra-ROD are not clear and, \ntherefore, recommendations on their use are contro-\nversial. In a recent review published in 2015, ultra-ROD \ntechniques are not recommended under general anes-\nthesia due to the registry of severe complications in the \nliterature, including cardiac arrest and death (20,21). \nIn a systematic review of 5 randomized studies, they \nconclude that its use is not advisable due to the lack \nof benefit and the potential documented risks and the \nhigh costs that generate the admission of patients in \nintensive care units based on general anesthesia or \ndeep sedation (22).\nAnother point to discuss is the different drugs that \nwe have used in the development of our ROD protocol.\nIn opioid detoxification techniques through induction \nof general anesthesia, the use of drugs such as cloni-\ndine and dexmedetomidine is approved, drugs that are \nused in a protocolized manner in our intensive care \nunit. We describe below the pharmacological reasons \nfor which these drugs are effective, although their indi-\ncation is out of the data sheet.\nDue to the high noradrenergic activity that is trig-\ngered after the withdrawal of opioids (characteristic \nwithdrawal syndrome), the use of \u03b12 agonists, such \nas clonidine or dexmedetomidine, has been successful \nin a large number of published studies. Their main lim-\nitation to use is the antihypertensive effect. Their ben-\neficial effects in this task are their sedative activity, the \nreduction of the activation of the sympathetic nervous \nsystem and the decrease in the requirements of opioids \ndescribed by mechanisms poorly known but that seem \nto be related to their activity on the nucleus ceruleus.\nThe \u03b12 agonist drugs are usually combined with \nanother type of drugs, which we also use in a protoco-\nlized way in our study. These drugs are benzodiazepines, \nin our case continuous perfusion (CP) of midazolam, \nideal for reducing levels of anxiety and improvement of \nsedation levels, ondansetron for the reduction of nau-\nsea and vomiting and loperamide for the treatment of \ndiarrhea in patients with withdrawal syndrome. Other \ndrugs used in our study are propofol, an hypnotic drug \nthat in CP controlled by Target Control Infusion (TCI) is \nideal for sedation to maintain spontaneous ventilation, \nand ketamine, whose sympathetic activity could be con-\nflicting in its use for opioids detoxification but, as we \nobserved in our study, ketamine is useful in combination \nwith the rest of the drugs used due to its analgesic \npotency.Ketamine is a drug widely used in anesthesia. Ket-\namine is classified as an NMDA receptor antagonist \nbut has many other actions on mu, delta and kappa opi-\noid receptors, and also Ketamine inhibits the reuptake \nof serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine (23). This \nmechanism of action has been used in anesthesia to \ndecrease tolerance to opioids, reduce the consumption \nof analgesics and increase the time in which patients \nbegin to consume analgesics in the postoperative peri-\nod (24). Moreover, the use of ketamine makes sense \nin patients who have established chronic pain.\nPrevious studies have described a successful opioid \ndetoxification with ketamine, even with ketamine orally \n(23). In a group of 58 patients, the administration of \ncontinuous ketamine infusions in subanesthetic doses, \n0.5 mg/kg/h dose, was also successful. The group \ntreated with ketamine experienced better control of \nOWS (25). These data are consistent with the find-\nings observed in our study that, despite the limitations \nof the sample size, the group treated with ketamine \npresented fewer signs and symptoms associated with \nthe withdrawal syndrome due to opioid deprivation and \nlower use of propofol.\nOur medium- and long-term results on the treated \npatients reaffirm us in the need to make the patient \nsee:\n1.  The continued risk for relapse that patient will \nhave throughout life.\n2.  That patient must inform the anesthesiologist \nimmediately if he/she is going to have surgery.\n3.  That patient will be monitored frequently by spe-\ncialists in pain, addictive behaviors, psychiatry and \npsychology, given that patient has overcome a \ncritical illness and the health of the patient should \nbe monitored.\nIn general, our patients report that they have got a \n\u201csecond chance\u201d at life. They continue with symptoms \nof pain but, in general, they refer less intense pain \nthan prior the treatment, but above all they report hav-\ning gained infinitely in quality of life, since they were \nimmersed in the spiral of side effects of opioids at all \nlevels, worsening even the painful perception severely. \nWe believe that these patients will need analgesic/\nadjuvant treatment, perhaps for life, but our limitation \nin the number of patients and the time after treatment \ndoes not allow us to know the long-term development.\nUnfortunately, we have had a therapeutic failure in \na young patient. After an extraordinary initial success \nin this patient with an improvement in quality of life and \nabsence of pain (which also encouraged her to want to \ncreate a support group for patients with similar condi-\ntions to prompt them to undergo ROD). After 6 months, \nthis patient began to reject everything, being evaluated \nby our entire multidisciplinary care group without being \nable to overcome the relapse, she began to take opioids \nout of the prescription of our environment, moving away \nfrom the guided and recommended therapy for her.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\u2013  According to the duration of our opioid detoxifica-\ntion method, we could classify it within the group \ndefined as ROD.RAPID OPIOID DETOXIFICATION  101\n\u2013  In all cases, a good level of sedation has been \nmaintained (measured by the Richmond Agitation \nSedation Scale (RASS)) without requiring invasive \nassistance of the airway and maintaining sponta-\nneous ventilation.\n\u2013  No patient in the study had severe complications. \nOnly a minor bronchoaspiration event occurred in \none patient without clinical consequences.\n\u2013  The amnesia of the patients of almost the entire \nlength of the stay at our intensive care unit is note-\nworthy, even the period they were awake and col-\nlaborating with the nursing staff.\n\u2013  The two cases that required the highest use of \ndrugs were those that had the highest opioid use \nat baseline. These were treated in the group of \ndexmedetomidine and midazolam, without ket-\namine, a fact that should be noted for the anal-\ngesic and hypnotic effect of ketamine. In addition, \npatients in this line of treatment showed more \nsymptoms and signs of OWS. These data are \nmerely observational due to the small sample size \nof our study.\n\u2013  Studies with larger sample size are needed to \nachieve conclusions with more quality and scien-\ntific evidence.\n\u2013  We strongly recommend selecting patients very \nwell to perform this technique. Thereby, they would \nbe able to assimilate the effort and risk they are \ngoing to undergo, so that they become aware that \na drastic change in their life is going to take place, \nand accept it.\n\u2013  We sincerely believe that the iatrogenesis due \nto the poorly controlled use of opioids should be \nsolved with more training on its use, and the ear -\nly detection of patients susceptible to developing \nproblems with these drugs.\n\u2013  We think that this technique represents \u201ca sec-\nond chance\u201d from which selected patients can \nbenefit.\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST \nAuthors declare no conflicts of interest.
