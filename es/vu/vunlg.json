This movie has to do with a nutritional program by Dr. \nMax Gerson and his natural therapy that, according to the Gerson Institute, \nmany people have used to heal some chronic diseases in the USA. In order \nto develop this project, we have used some different methods. The method \nused on this research is mainly quali tative since we will go deeper into issues \nof interest by analyzing terms and phrases used in the translation process, as \nwell as evaluating a logical deduction and rhetorical of some of the lexical \nand grammatical structures and constructions. Of course, also by taking into \naccount the numerous social and cultural benefits that we all may get from \nthis translation. It is also descriptive and explanatory, as we illustrate the \ndetails about the whole translation process and the tools applied herein. It is \nalso informative for the reason that one of the main ideas of this project, \nbesides the translation process itself, is to contribute to the field of translation \nstudies by providing the research community with thorough research work \ncontaining annotations in  the scientific field.  \n \nKey Words: Render, Annotate, Translation Techniques, Translation \nProcess, Lexical and Grammatical Structures and Constructions.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n1 \n INTRODUCTION  \nTranslation is a process that consists of converting a text from one \nlanguage to another w hile keeping the meaning of the original text. To be \nable to do that in a systematic way, several techniques need to be learned. \nThis project, which is about translating the documentary movie The Beautiful \nTruth , is a reflection of the application of all t he translation methods, tools, \nand techniques learned during our academic program. Translating a movie \npresents the challenge of translating its script while keeping the translation \ninto the context given by its video, and in this way conveying the intende d \nmessage of the movie.  \nAs a fundamental basis for this project, we are carrying out Annotated \nTranslation which is a scientific process that goes beyond simply translating \na text, by offering the most suitable rendering of the problematic expressions, \nterms, and sentences from the source text, making a deeper analysis, and \noffering solutions to some problems that the source text may present when it \nis being translated into the target language. The annotations are done by  \ncreating comments, usually a few se ntences long, establishing a summary \nfor and expressing the relevance of each part of the source that needs a \ncloser look.  According to the Gerson Institute representatives, there is a lot of \ninformation about their natural health treatment that needs to b e translated \ninto Spanish, including the movie The Beautiful Truth . The translation of this \nmovie from English to Spanish is expected to benefit the Spanish -speaking \npeople by helping them to overcome the language barrier and providing  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n2 \n access to a natural alternative therapy that claims to cure patients with \ncancer and other degenerative diseases.  \nStatement of the Problem  \nSince the movie The Beautiful Truth,  which contains valuable \ninformation about potential treatments and cures for certain diseases, is \navailable only in English, the Spanish -speaking community cannot get the \nbenefits from it and neither the field of nutrition and scientific development in \nour society.  \nObjectives  \na) General Objective  \nTo offer an annotated translation for the Spanish -speaki ng community \nto have access to the movie The Beautiful Truth  so that they are able to get \nthe benefit offered in that information.  \nb) Specific Objectives  \n- To translate the script from English to Spanish providing an analysis \nthrough annotations.  \n- To inf orm about the population who the project will be intended for, in this \ncase, the Spanish -speaking Community.  \n- To explore the benefits of the translation for this community.  \n  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n3 \n CHAPTER I  \n1. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK (LITERATURE REVIEW)  \n1.1. Referential Framework   \nSince the content of this informative documentary movie The Beautiful \nTruth  is in English, the majority of the Spanish -speaking community is \nunaware of the existence of the Gerson Therapy, which , according to the \nGerson Institute, is  a natural alternativ e program  to cure some degenerative \ndiseases . Some people who have been convinced by their doctors that they \nare terminally ill would be pleased  to know that there is still hope. Others who \nsuffer by undergoing the harsh methods employed by traditional med icine \nwould also be glad to learn that there are gentler methods available to them.   \nIn order to give a solution to this problem, volunteer translators f rom \nthe Catholic University  of Santiago de Guayaquil offer their services to the \nGerson Institute, rend ering the Spanish translation of the information from the \nmovie, applying the techniques learned in the degree study program and \ngiving an extensive analysis and offering solutions to any translation problem. \nTherefore, the translation of the movie into Sp anish will make  the information \naccessible to more people; and the opportunity of having this alternative \ntreatment available may increase the number of people who would benefit \nfrom it . It will also help to contribute  to the improvement  of the  field of \nnutrition by transmitting this scientific information from the American to the \nSpanish -speaking  community , where  we as  translator s are  the fundamental \ntransmitter s.  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n4 \n When translating a movie several aspects have to be considered \ncarefully . Translation is a mu lti-step process that must be carried out by a \nprofessional, who follows the appropriate steps during this process and \ndomains the linguistic, semantic, syntactic structures of the source and target \nlanguage, as well as cultural references, among many othe r aspects \ninvolved.   \nSome time ago , The Gerson Institute had some problems with \nmistranslation services , by a volunteer translator, who translated a book from \nEnglish into Spanish and he did not have a good knowledge about \nTranslation and the different tec hniques it involves, so the result was badly \ntranslated information, and the book was not published because the Institute \nverified the information with someone who knew Spanish and realized it was \nnot an accurate translation; the translator had not transmi tted the same \nmessage from the original source. Since then, the institute has been looking \nfor someone professional to help them transmit their information from web \npages, videos, books, among other materials.  \nThe Gerson Institute, located in the United S tates, did not considered \nthe fact that the most famous means around the world for transmitting \ninformation is through web pages with free and user -friendly access for \npeople all over the world to get any kind of information from different \ncountries. Nowadays, they have been planning to expand  their information \nfor the Spanish Community since they know that there is a good demand for \nhaving information available in Spanish around the world.    \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n5 \n This year 50 million Hispanics in the US hold nearly $1 trillion i n \npurchasing power.  As the US Hispanic population and \npurchasing power grows, it has become increasingly important \nfor companies in certain industries to translate their websites \ninto Spanish.

We \nare using Annotations as a scientific method to explain the choices we \nbelieve are the most accurate ones, by categorizing them accordingly, which \nmeans that we are analyzing the problems that each of these choices may \nencounter .  \nAccording to  the requirements for a postgraduate degree in Literary \nTranslation of the Trinity College Dublin :  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n7 \n An annotated translation should have a brief introduction \npresenting the text, indicating its  interest, and explaining what \nkinds of difficulties it might present. The introduction might well \naddress the problem of what a translation is, dealing with some \ntheoretical points, and suggesting particular problems inherent \nin translating between the tw o languages concerned,  or dealing \nwith the text type . \n \nThe purpose of carrying out an annotated translation mainly has to do \nwith the fact that it allows translators to develop translation skills by \npresenting not only the translated product itself, but al so justifying their \ntranslation decisions. Secondly, it also involves critical thinking when \nreflecting about the translation process.  \nThe function of an annotated translation is to offer a deeper analysis \non the translation process of a given text. Likewi se, this critical reflection can \nfunction as an approximation to the translated text which emphasizes the \ninternal structure of the text, and not only that, but this reflection also acts as \na theoretical and methodological of the proposed translation.  \nTo develop the annotation for our translation, we have considered the  \nfollowing  aspects  which have been translated from Rosas  (n.d.):  \n- Formal A spects, which  refer to grammar issues ( for example, type of \nvocabulary, syntactic structur e, etc.), and also of st ylistic nature (is the text to \nbe translated a story, a poem, or a scientific text?, w hat are the stylistic \nconventions in which the text is adapted to ; for instance, if it is a sonnet or if it \nwas written during the Romanticism , etc. \n- Rhetorical A spects:  In this case, it is about how the text is written. \nWhich is its internal structure, its expository scheme?, what kind of ideas it \naddresses or discuss es and how does it do it?, w hat kind of images use or  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n8 \n create and how does it use or build them?, a re ther e any recurring \nelements?, w hat kind of tropes are present, how do they work and what is \ntheir function?  \n- Thematic Aspects : The question to consider here is: what is the text \nabout?  \nAs well, it is necessary to establish a relationship or connection \nbetwee n theme and form.  \n- Other Aspects: External elements of the text, such as, biographical, \nhistorical or critical information that documents the work of the author of the \ntext, it is also important to include information and reflections about  the \ncontexts in  which the texts are placed or inserted in both source and target \ncultures (type of publication, audience to  whom the text is intended to, etc.). \nSuch information must be relevant to the text we are working with.  \nOn the other hand, whichever the aspects tr anslators decide to work \nwith, they must not forget that this analysis is about annotations, and that \ncritical perspective has to be oriented to explain them by clarifying the \nrelationship of the aforementioned aspects in rela tion to the translation \nproces s; i.e., it is not impo rtant to talk about the text itself, but showing how \nthe intrinsic characteristics of the text affects and are affected by its \ntranslation.  \nAnnotations can also be done within the same language , by analyzing \nsome aspects and problems  that language may present within specific \ncontexts and according to particular situations , or between two languages as \nin this case of the translation of our script . Moreover, they can be carried out  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n9 \n within the translated text, through footnotes  or separa tely by categorizing the \ntranslation problems, giving an analysis, citing and comparing both pieces of \ntranslation from the source and target text.   For the translation of th is script, \nwe have decided to do it through annotations divided into five \ncategori zations , such us: metaphors, cultural translation problems, linguistic \ntranslation problems, text  specific translation problems , and pragmatic \nproblems.  \nFurthermore, in order to solve these translation problems, it is \nfundamental to do it at a professional  level considering different theories \ninvolved in this process according to different translation experts and \nlinguists. These theories include two different concepts within this field such \nas communicative and semantic translation introduced by Newmark  (1981), \nwhich we have used for the translation of the movie  script , and also other \ncomparable approaches by Nida (1964) and Jakobson  (1959) .  \nAs it is known, the main purpose of a documentary movie is to inform \nsome aspect of reality, mainly for the intentio ns of instruction or preserving a \nhistorical record. In addition, since this movie contains interviews to some \nexperts, live experiments, and real images which demonstrate a number of \nthose authentic facts, it is essential for us, as translators, to convey  the most \naccurate contextual meaning of the original message. As a result, the target \naudience will receive the intended message accordingly.  \nThe script includes many idiomatic expressions, metaphors, among \nother figures of speech, and communicative trans lation is the most accurate \noption in order to render the content effectively, taking into account the  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n10 \n culture, perception, and cognition of language of the TT readers, transmitting \nthe messages beyond lexical units.  \nFirst of all, \u201cCommunicative translati on, also known as functional \nequivalence, attempts to produce on its readers an effect as close as \npossible to that obtained on the readers of the original.\u201d (Newmark, 1981, p. \n39). According to this description, communicative translation focuses on the \nreader. Therefore,  it is clear that this type of translation  consists of  conveying  \nthe same message from the  original language  by using the most natural \nequivalents into  the target language , especially  taking into account  sense \nand style. In addition, commun icative translation  is usually  common,  clear, \neasy reading, fluent, creative, informative, etc; for instance,  it is typically used \nin texts  that have an informative function  and texts  that contain  instructions,  \nsuch as plays, among others . Besides, the fin al product of a communicative \ntranslation  can be  better than the original , since it involves  a subjective work  \nof re-creation  and reformulation , mainly  focused on the TT reader .  \nAccording to Newmark (1991), translation  is a process, a skill, a type \nof com munication by which two messages are transmitted between two \ndifferent languages . \nFurthermore, the main purpose of translation studies is to determine \nappropriate translation methods for a wide range of texts and textual types, \nproviding a set of principle s to translate texts and carrying out translation \nanalyses. Also, the aim of these studies is to go into detail about the \nrelationship among thought, meaning and language, considering the \nelements involved in the translation process. The translator uses di fferent  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n11 \n techniques that require a process of understanding, interpretation, re -\ncreation, etc.  \nAdditionally, there are two approaches suggested by Nida (1964) \nwhich are comparable to communicative and semantic translation in which \nthe first one is similar t o Nida\u2019s dynamic equivalence, and the second one to \nNida\u2019s formal equivalence. This is  a quite similar theory, but using different \nnames, Nida argues that, when making his work, the translator is torn \nbetween two styles of translating that represent two op posite poles: the \ntranslation of \"formal equivalence\" (toward the source text) and the \"dynamic \nequivalence\" (toward the audience and target culture).  \nJust to make a slightly comparison between these two types of \nequivalence , here  is a better explanation a bout them: (Nida, 1964).  \n1) Formal equivalence (also known as formal correspondence), which \nis more concerned with word -for-word translation and content (faithfulness).  \n2) Dynamic equivalence, which is focused upon context and sense -\nfor-sense adaptation.  \nNida (1964) defends the idea that the intention of every translator \nmust be to cause the target text receiver the same effect as produces the \noriginal text in the reader. The dynamic equivalence or effect is an adaptation \nof the text to the new reader so th at it conceives a text translation as natural, \nnot forced, within its linguistic community, for which the translator must \novercome linguistic and cultural differences. The translator must definitely \nsearch for the most natural and closer equivalent, and tr ansmit the original \ntext effect in the closest way possible to the target text.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n12 \n Jamalimanesh and Rahkhoda ( 2009 ) state d on their online article  that \nNida (1964, p. 159)  indicates that  \"a translation of  a dynamic equivalence \naims  at complete naturalness of  expression, and tries to relate the receptor to \nmodes  of behavior relevant within the context of his own culture\" . (Retrieved \nfrom http://www.translationdirectory.com/articles/article2025.php ). \nAccording to this definition, it is clear that dynamic equival ence , also \nknown as  functional equivalence , attempts to convey  the idea or message \nexpressed in  the original text, through some syntactic changes from the SL \ninto the TL; for instance, sentence structure such us word  order , parts of \nspeech , among others , and also  the TL reader\u2019s response  must be  \nessentially the same  to that of the SL reader.  \nAs Jamalimanesh and Rahkhoda (20 09) also mentioned that Nida and \nTaber (1969, p. 200) stated that \"The message of the original text has been \nso transposed into the rece ptor language that the response of the receptor is \nessentially like that or the original receptor s\". (Retrieved from \nhttp://www.translationdirectory.com/articles/article2025.php ). \nThe theory of dynamic  equivalence emphasizes the  importance of \nother  element s of communication  that go beyond the se opposite  features : \nliteral/free , form/content , considering two  elements: the reader  and message.  \nFor that reason , the translator  has to look  for a more natural  \nequivalent.  It is absolutely essential to transmit the s ame SL message , \nregardless of  the form  of the text because the most important aspect within \ndynamic translation is the content , in which words from the original  text are \nnot as important  as their meaning. This means that the message must be  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n13 \n adapted to the linguistic needs of the TL reader, considering language \nstructures  which are familiar to this reader , by making lexical changes \naccording to the cultural references of the TL reader.  \nThese grammar adaptations are carried out because the syntactic \nstructur e of the target language differs from that of the source language. For \nexample, when the translator modifies the SL word order, such as \nsubstituting a ST verb for a TT noun, among others. These adaptations in the \ntarget language and culture provide a trans lation that does not show evident \nsigns of foreign origin, so that a fluid and natural text is produced in the TL. \nThis type of equivalence  is the most appropriate when translating  idioms , \nmetaphors, proverbs, among others.  \nMoreover, Jakobson (1959) has al so suggested a communicative \napproach within translation and according to his theory it involves \n\u201csubstituting messages in one language not for separate code -units but for \nentire messages in some other language\u201d ( p. 36). \nThis approach is comparable to that  of Newmark and Nida previously \nmentioned, because they focus on transmitting the content from one \nlanguage, not only by translating words, but entire messages into another \nlanguage. Therefore, \u201ctranslation involves two equivalent messages in  two \ndifferent  codes\u201d (p. 114).  \nMoreover, Jakobson states that everything can be translated, either \nthrough more complex signs such as syntactic structures, or new lexical \nresources such as loans, calques, neologisms, etc. This means that although \nit is not always possi ble to find a direct equivalent in the TT, any type of  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n14 \n translation can be achieved by using the most appropriate translation \nresources to interpret meaning from different languages.  Therefore, any \nmessage can be expressed into any language, since language is an element \nof communication which is able to overcome differences between two \ndifferent systems. Thus, the task of the translator is to transfer the content \nfrom the source text into the target language by ensuring equivalence.  \nOn the other hand, there  are some parts of the script where it is strictly \nnecessary to resemble the formal equivalence, and evidently, following the \nsemantic structure of the original text as close as possible.  \nFirstly, Newmark (1988) states that semantic translation is  a \ncompro mise between  free and literal  translation , it is applied to  expressive  \ntexts, and it is distinguished from  the true translation  simply  because it takes  \ninto consideration  the aesthetic  of the original text version . He also says that \nsemantic translation  is not the same as  literal  translation in the sense  of or \nwithin the linguistic approach , the TT product may be inferior to  the original , \nbecause there is an inevitable loss of meaning  in this process  since the  \nprimary concern of using semantic translation i s the original text and  not the \ntarget culture , it is a  translation that  is both  linguistic  and encyclopedic . \nSemantic translation  is applied to  philosophical, religious, anthropological, \npolitical  texts , among others. Moreover, he explains that semantic t ranslation  \nis considered as an art ; it is usually done by a  single person , and it is related \nto deliberation processes .  \nNewmark (1988) also mentions that semantic translation is a method \nvery similar to the true translation. The only thing that differs is  that we should  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n15 \n pay more attention to the aesthetic value (i.e. a nice and natural tone) of the \ntext in the original language.  \nIn a semantic translation, the translator tries to convey the most \naccurate contextual meaning of the original text, but within t he limitations of \nsyntactic and semantic meta -language. Munday (2008) stated that Semantic \nTranslation resembles the formal equivalence since it also follows the \nstructure of the original text as close as possible. For example, if possible, \nthe sentence le ngth and order of words is kept. This means, as Newmark \n(1991), said that Semantic Translation also focuses on the original language, \nas well as on semantic and syntactic structures, but within the constraints of \nthe target language. Furthermore, as in the  formal equivalence, the culture of \nthe original language is pres erved . \nOne difference between these two methods is that in semantic \ntranslation the meaning is the most important, while the formal equivalence \nfocuses more on the message. Another feature is  that semantic translation is \nconsidered inferior to the original text as it always involves the loss of \nmeaning (Newmark, 1981). Furthermore, using this method, the translator \npays attention to the aesthetic value of the text in the original language. Tha t \nmeans that the translator tries to reproduce the 'flavor' and tone of the \noriginal, since the words are 'sacred' (Newmark). Moreover, the translator \nhas no right to improve or correct the original text. Thus the goal of semantic \ntranslation is to make an  accurate and true from the original language \n(Newmark, 1991).   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n16 \n From those characteristics can be deduced that semantic translation \ncorresponds to literal translation, but not exactly the same. The difference \nbetween the two methods is that semantic transla tion respects the context, \ninterprets and sometimes explains, which does not occur in the literal \ntranslation. When the translation is literal, the translator's primary loyalty is to \nthe rules of the original language, while when the translation is semanti c, the \ntranslator's primary loyalty is to the author (Newmark, 1981).  \nThe translation by formal equivalence is mainly aimed at preserving \nthe linguistic form of the original mother tongue, trying to imitate it in the word \nsequence, syntax and, insofar as p ossible, the sonority and the phonology of \nthe target language. The formal equivalence occurs only rarely, since factors \nsuch as cultural differences do not allow a tracing of the formal structural \nyielding results in a strangeness feeling in the reader's goal which in most \ncases is used in this type of equivalence. Obviously, the reader expects a \nproduct that is not able to recognize as a translation, but as a construct that \nidentifies within the formal structures and idiomatic language.  \nNida (1964) strong ly suggests that what really matters is to keep the \ncontent and believes that sometimes, the translator's effort for maintaining \nthe form of the original text involves losses in the content of the message. \nWhat is important, according to him, is to get tha t the translated text reader \nreacts the same way as the recipients of the message in their original \nlanguage do; therefore, the translator must manage how to transfer the \nsemantic value to the communicative reality of the target.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n17 \n Following the ideas of Nid a (1959), the translator must keep the value \nof the message in both languages in order to achieve the same \nunderstanding effect on the original text reader as well as the reader of the \ntranslated text. The idea is not trying to convey words, but the semant ic \nvalues of the message to a different linguistic community. A clear example of \nthe adaptation of the translated text to the situation of the recipient linguistic \ncommunity is the translation of the different images presented in the Bible. \nThis translatio n must be able to maintain the strengthening effect on the faith \nof believers while transmitting images and messages in a way that is close to \nthe realities of all communities. As an expert translator of the Bible, Nida and \nhis concept of mostly dynamic eq uivalence and less use of the formal \nequivalence, revolutionized the field of translating religious texts.  \nAs it is known, any means of communication, and therefore the \ntranslation, is subject to the semiotics of law (which involves the \ntridimensional aspe cts of syntactic meaning, pragmatic meaning, and \nsemantic meaning) or semantic loss (which, according to some research, \nresults primarily from the lack of equivalence between the source text and the \ntarget text). And of course, we cannot leave out the cult ural loss part, which \nis also an important issue to consider in translation, especially when \ntranslating a movie.  \"If we insist that the translation should not entail any \nloss of information, obviously not only translation, but all communication, \nwould be  impossible\" (Nida, 1959, p. 13).  \nAdditionally, based on the previous information, we have placed in the \nfollowing table the most general characteristics and important differences  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n18 \n between semantic and communicative translation according to Newmark \n(1991) : \nTable 2. Features of Semantic and Communicative Translation  \nSemantic T ranslation  Communicative  Translation  \nConsists of keeping the linguistic \nstructures of the ST, looking for the \nclosest equivalents in the TT  Consists of transmitting the content \nand mess age from the ST into the TT  \nFaithful to the form of the source \nlanguage. It is more literal  Faithful to the meaning of the source \nlanguage. It is  freer \nTranslating  'sense  for sense\u2019  \nFocused on the author and source \nlanguage  Focused on the reader and targ et \nlanguage  \nThe translator cannot make changes \nor corrections from the ST  The translator can make modifications \nconsidered to be appropriate and \nimportant (deletions, additions, etc)  \nSometimes the translation does  not \nresult  so fluent or natural  It crea tes a natural, fluent and \nunderstandable text  \nTranslation unit: lexical units, clauses, \ncollocations  Translation unit: phrases or larger \nunits (e.g. paragraphs)  \nObjective  Subjective  \nScientific, technical texts, etc  Literary texts: poetry and plays, etc   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n19 \n In this table, it is possible to see that both types of translation are two \nopposi te methods in many ways. As aforementioned, both methods are \nfocused on different aspects, and they produce  different translations. For \ninstance, both have very different fe atures, and the translator\u2019s limitations \ndepend on the method used. Furthermore, the decision on which method the \ntranslator must use depends on several factors, including which aspects are \nimportant to consider  and what the translator  is willing to achiev e with his \ntranslation  from the ST to the TT . The translator can try to be faithful to the \noriginal language and its form, or to the meaning and content of the original \ntext according to the situation ; not only depends on the text itself, but also on \nwheth er the translator wants to translate taking into account the ST author or \nthe TT reader , among others . \n1.2. Conceptual Framework  \nIn order to develop this research project, there must be terminological \nclarifications which are necessary for the familiarizat ion and understanding of \nkey concepts along this manuscript. All these terms are basically used in this \nspecific type of research whose contents are totally related to the Scientific \nTranslation Process.  \n1.2.1. Aesthetic Value  \nAesthetic Value refers to  \"A premium attached to the value of property \nbecause of its physical appearance or the scenic views that may be enjoyed  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n20 \n from the property; the artistic worth of something, rather than its practical \nvalue\".  (TheFreeDictionary.com, 2013).  \nThis definition is a g eneral overview of Aesthetic Value; however, it \ncan be applied to our linguistic field as well . \n1.2.2. Annotation (Annotated Translation)  \nAccording to the Trinity College Dublin \"An annotated translation \nshould have a brief introduction presenting the text , indicating its interest, and \nexplaining what kinds of difficulties it might present\". For the purpose of this \nstudy, this is the definition that best describes this term applied to give a \nlinguistic analysis of the use of a specific word or phrase accord ing to the \ncontext of the original document in which it is fundamental to follow the \nprocess of carrying out an analysis, critical comments, explanatory notes, \nobservations, among others; including translation problems involved in this \nprocess, such as the  recognition of metaphors; pragmatic, cultural, and \nlinguistic translation errors, register, etc.  \n1.2.3 . Borrowing  \n \nAccording to Hock and Brian (1996): \nBorrowing is the adoption of individual words or even of large \nsets of vocabulary items from another lan guage or dialect . \nExamples of such borrowings or abound such as rouge ( from \nFrench), macho  (from Spanish), yen \u2018craving\u2019 (from Chinese), \nor schwa  (from Hebrew via German in English) . (p. 241 ) \n \nThis definition and the examples best illustrate the whole purp ose of \nborrowing in the Translation field which indicates that a word can be taken \nfrom another language and used in the intended language without translating  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n21 \n it, being one of the simplest of all translation techniques. For instance, \nMexican Span : \u2018tacos\u2019,  \u2018empanadas\u2019, \u2018tortillas\u2019, among others, are borrowed \nby different languages.  \n1.2.4.  Calqu e \n \nAccording to Munday and Hatim (2004) : \nA calque is a special kind of borrowing whereby a language \nborrows an expression  form of another, but then translates \nliteral ly each of its elements. The result is either:  \ni. a lexical calque, as in the first example below, i.e. a calque \nwhich respects the syntactic structure of the TL, whilst \nintroducing a new mode of expression; or  \nii. a structural calque, as in the second exa mple, below, which \nintroduces a new  construction into the language . (p. 149)  \n \nExamples:  \nFrench -English calque s: \nMariage de convenance:  Marriage of convenience   \nChampagne:    Champagne  \n1.2.5. Cognitive L inguistics  \n \nAccording to Croft  and Cruse (2004), C ognitive Linguistics refers to : \nThe approach to the study of language that began to emerge in \nthe 1970s. We see three major hypothesis as guiding the \ncognitive ling uistic approach to language: language is not an \nautonomous cognitive faculty, grammar is conceptualization, \nand knowledge of language emerges from l anguage use . (p. 1).  \n \nIn brief, this  discipline studies the  linguistic knowledge  and cognitive \npsychology  that explores mental processes , such as perception , memory, \nattention, among others.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n22 \n 1.2.6. Collocations  \nAccording to Nesselhauf  (2004) : \nIn one of these two views, a collocation is considered the co -\noccurrence of words at a certain distance, and a distinctio n is \nusually made between co -occurrences that are frequent (or \nmore precisely, more frequent than could be expected if words \ncombined randomly in a language) and those that are not . (p. \n11-12)   \n \nThis is the description that best defines this term used in the intention \nof our research paper since it absolutely offers the explanation of when two \nor more words are used together in the proper grammatical structure in order \nto transfer the accurate message from one language to another in the \nTranslation field.  \n1.2.7. Condensation  \n \n \u201cWhereby a source element or construction corresponds to a tighter \nor compact target counterpart\u201d (Malone, 1998, p.59). This is a translation \ntechnique that produces a more economic text in the TT (Malone, 1998). It is \nsimilar to Red uction which is described within the translation techniques \nwhich are explained in Chapter II.  \n1.2.8. Corpus  Linguistics  \n \nAccording to McEnery and Hardie  (2012) , \u201cCorpus Linguistics is the \nstudy of language data on a large scale \u2013 the computer -aided analy sis of \nvery extensive collections of transcribed utterances or written texts\" (p. v). In \ngeneral, a corpus linguistically speaking relates to a  large collection of texts  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n23 \n which can be written or spoken materials that include a linguistic analysis and \nalso p rovides lexical, semantic, pragmatic, morphosyn tactic information, \namong other linguistic aspects . \n1.2.9. Equivalence  \n \nAccording to Munday and Hatim (2004), equivalence is used to render \n\u201ctwo texts using completely different stylistic and structural method s. In such \ncases we are dealing with the method which procedures equivalent texts\u201d \n(p.150). This is the opposite of literal translation, and it is carried out to \ntranslate idioms, metaphors, proverbs, among other figures of speech in \nwhich it is absolutely  essential to transmit the same content and meaning of \nthe message into the TT by changing the structure of the ST.  \n1.2.10. Figures of S peech  \nAccording to Myers (2009) : \nFigures of speech focus upon literary devices or techniques to \nspice up and invigorate  prose and poetry. Among the included \ndevices are simile, metaphor, paradox, irony, litotes, \nsynecdoche and alliteration which will introduce new vocabulary \nas part of the creative learning. (p. 4). \n \nThe figures of speech are often applied  in literary work s, and the \nauthors use them  in order  to enrich the  lexicon of a language . \n1.2.11. Lacuna  (Lexical Gap)   \n \nA point within a system of sense relations at which a word \nmight be expected but none exists. Thus in the system of words \nfor a person's relations pare nt and child subsume both father \nand son (male) and mother and daughter (female); from this an \nanalysis of the system might predict a similar term subsuming  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n24 \n e.g. uncle and aunt. Then, since there is none, it might be \ndescribed as having a gap at that point . (Matthews, 2007).  \n \nSo that  the best way to solve the problem of lexical gaps in languages \nis by carrying out \u2018borrowing\u2019 which description was mentioned above, or \nfinding equivalents.  \n1.2.12. Linguistics  \n \nAccording to Lyons (2002), \" Linguistics is usual ly defined at the \nscience of language or, alternatively, as the scientific study of language \" (p. \n37). \nLyons also stated:  \nLinguistics, as has been emphasized before, has natural link \nwith a wide range of academic disciplines. To say that \nlinguistics is a s cience is not to deny that, by virtue of its \nsubject -matter, it is closely related to such eminently humane \ndisciplines as philosophy and literary criticism . (p. 45 -46). \n \nFor the purpose of our study the above citations  best de fine this term \nsince they des cribe  some specific aspects of language involved in linguistics , \nproviding the overview of this study, apart from stating that it is a  science . \nLinguistics not only involves theory, but also includes scientific and detailed \nobservations about language.  \n1.2.13. Literal translation  \n \nAccording to Salem,  Alsubaie and Almuntashri ( 2010 ): \nLiteral translation, also known in everyday usage as direct \ntranslation, denotes the rendering of text from one language to \nanother \u201cword for word\u201d (Latin: \u201cverbum pro verbo\u201d ra ther than \nconveying the sense of the original ). However, in translation \nstudies, literal translation denotes technical translation of  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n25 \n scientific, technical, te chnological or legal texts.  (Retrieved from \nhttp://fr.slideshare.net/studentsandteachers/types -of-\ntranslation ). \nThis is an accurate definition within the Translation field in which there \nis a brief comparison in order to explain that \u2018sense\u2019 is not taking into account \nwhen applying literal translation.  Besides, t his type of  translation  that follows \nthe form of the source language is carried out according to several factors \ninvolved in both languages.  \n1.2.14. Complex Lexical Items  \n \nAccording to Mos (2010) , Complex Lexical  Items can be defined as : \nComplex lexical items are strings of language in which more \nthan one  meaning -carrying element can be recognized yet \nwhich are very likely candidates to be stored as units in \npeople\u2019s lingu istic repertoires. Complexity here should not be \nunderstood as something which is difficult, but only as an \ncontaining internal structure . (p. 24).  \n \nThis definition aforementioned provides a better understanding of what \nthis term involves. It is commonly u sed in Translation, and it is clear that \nlanguages are made up of these items which are either single words or \nphrases that helps us to communicate through a natural rendering between \nlanguages . \n1.2.15. Meta -Language  \nAccording to Gombert (1992), Meta -langu age is \u201ca language \ncomposed of the entirety of words forming linguistic terminology (for \nexample, syntax, semantics, phoneme, lexeme\u2026 as well as terms in more \ncurrent usage, such as a word, sentence, letter, etc.)\u201d. (p.1). T his concept is  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n26 \n the one that best  illustrates the meaning of what a meta -language has to do \nwith Linguistics and since our project is totally focused on Translation with all \nits methods, techniques, issues and everything that involves this interesting \nfield.  \n1.2.16. Meta -Linguistic  \n \nAccor ding to Gombert (1992), Meta -linguis tics is \u201cone thing to find an \nadequate way of treating the comprehension and production of language. It is \nquite another to succeed in adopting a reflexive attitude with regard to \nlanguage objects and their manipulation\u201d . (p.1). This concept  is the one \nwhich  best fits  in our project since it is totally  concerned with the linguistic \nside; in fact, it is described in  both a general and a more specific point of view  \nso we can learn  it from different perspectives.   \n1.2.17. Na turalization  \n\u201cNaturalization succeeds transference where the source language \nword is adapted first to the normal pronunciation, then to the normal \nphonological and morphological form of the target language\u201d (Wilfreda , n.d., \np. 5. Retrieved from \nhttp://engl ish.um.edu.my/anuvaada/PAPERS/LEGASPI.pdf ). \nNaturalization has been taken into account during our translation \nprocess because a good piece of translation has to transmit the same \nmessage from the original source in a natural and fluent way into the target \ntext.  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n27 \n 1.2.18. Neologism  \n \nAccording to Levchenko (2010) : \"Neologism is a word or phrase \ncreated for defining a new (unknown before) object or expressing a new \nnotion \". (p. 11 -12). The creation of neologisms has to do with social and \ncultural changes, and al so with the scientific and technological development, \nand they can be derived from a foreign language  but the intended audience \nhas to incorporate it in its vocabulary being accepted and used as a new \ncoined term or phrase . \n1.2.19. Phonology  \nAccording to  Lass (1998 ), \"Phonology , broadly speaking, is that sub -\ndiscipline within linguistics concerned with 'the sounds of language'. More \nnarrowly, phonology proper is concerned with the function, behavior, and \norganization of sounds as LINGUSITIC items \". (p. 1) . In the linguistic field, it  \nfocuses on the way how sounds work in a specific language or languages in \ngeneral, and how these sounds are organized, the interactio n with each \nother, among other linguistics aspects  directly related with the sounds . \n1.2.20. Pr agmatics  \nWith respect to Pragmatics, Yule (1996)  indicates the following:  \nPragmatics is concerned with the study of meaning as \ncommunicated by a speaker (or writer) and interpreted by a \nlistener (or reader). It has, consequently, more to do with the \nanalys is of what people mean by their utterances than what the \nwords or phrases in those utte rances might mean by \nthemselves . (p. 3).   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n28 \n This means that it focuses on analyzing how people produce and \ninterpret utterances within a context , considering the extra  linguistic factors \nthat determine language usage . \n1.2.21. Register  \n \nHatim and Munday (2004) has described register as \u201cthe configuration \nof semantic resources that the member of a culture typically associates with \na situation type. It is the meaning potential that is (linguistically) accessible in \na given social context\u201d (p.191).  Based on the definition given, register  is the \nset of  contextual  and sociolinguistic  variables  that determine  how language is  \nused  in a particular context . This is an appropriate defin ition intended to  this \nstudy since it  provides a clear explanation about this linguistic term.  \n1.2.22. Rendering  \n \nAccording to Cambridge D ictionaries Online , Rendering is  \u201ca \ntranslation of a book or piece of writing into a different language or a different  \nstyle\u201d. Example: \"A new rendering of the Bible into modern English\". This \nterm has some other different meanings; nevertheless, the definition \naforementioned is the most accurate one within this field of study, in which \nthe translated text is the final pr oduct or rendering.  (Retrieved from \nhttp://dictionary.cambridge.org ). \n1.2.23. Script  \n \nBased on the definition given in Oxford Dictionaries Online, script is \n\u201cthe written text of a play, film, or broadcast\u201d. This is a common term used not  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n29 \n only in the field of translation, but also in ot her fields of study; however, we \nthink it is important to mention it because there is a script i ntended to be \ntranslated for this  project, and many other professional translators around the \nworld carry out the translation of t hese kind s of work. \n(http://www.oxforddictionaries.com ). \n1.2.24. Semantics  \n \nPalmer  (1981) defined Semantics as \u201cthe technical term used to refer \nto the study of meaning, and, since meaning is a part of language, sema ntics \nis a part of linguistics\u201d (p.1).  Besides,  it refers to the interpretation  of linguistic \nsigns  such as symbols , words , expressions  or formal representations . An \nunderstanding of S emantics is absolutely essential to the study of language \nacquisition , which is the cognitive process by which human beings acquire \nthe capacity to understand language and communicate through the use of \nwords and sentences.  \n1.2.25. Semiotics  \nAccording to T he University of Vermont (2013), \"Semiotics, or \nSemiology is the study of signs, symbols, and signification. It is the study of \nhow meaning is created, not what it is.\" (para. 1). This discipline focuses on \nthe communication systems within society, and also on the interpretatio n and \nproduction of sounds.

Sonority  \nWith respect to Sonority, Roach (2009)  mentions the following : \nIt is possible to describe sounds in terms of how powerful they \nsound to the listener; a vowel sound such as a is said to be \nmore sonorant than the fricative f, for example. It is said that if \nwe hear a word such as \u2018banana\u2019 as consisting of three \nsyllables, it is because we can hear three peaks of so nority \ncorrespo nding to the vowels. (p. 79).  \n \nThis information agrees with our linguistic reasons in order to express \nwhat the main idea of our research paper carries out giving us the \nopportunity to use  it in the Translation field accordingly.  \n1.2.27. Sou rce Text & Target Text  \n \nIn accordance with Synonyms & Antonyms (2013) , Source T ext is \"the \noriginal text from which a translation is done  into another language , often \nabbreviated as ST\u201d. This definitio n is commonly used by professionals in the \nTranslation field who perfectly know that the source text is the one intended \nto be translated into any other language.  On the other hand, Target T ext is \n\u201cthe finished product of a translated  text, often abbreviated as TT\u201d, so this \nterm and its definition represents  the message  that goes from the original text  \nto the intended audience . (http:/ /www.synonyms.net/antonyms/).  \n1.2.28. Source Language & Target Language  \n \nAccording to Dictionary.com , Source Language is  \"the language in \nwhich a text appears that is to be t ranslated into another language\"; and \nTarget Language is \" the language into which a text is to be t ranslated from \nanother language\". ( http://dictionary.refere nce.com/ ). In the Translation field,  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n31 \n Source Language is abbreviated as SL and Target Language as TL. As well \nas the terms mentioned above, this termino logy is frequently used in th e \nTranslation field, and it is necessary to know about them in order to make a \ndistinction between both languages.  \n1.2.29. Syntax  \n \nAccording to Van Valin Jr. (1997):  \nThe term \"S yntax\" is from the Ancient Greek Syntaxis, a verbal \nnoun which literally means \"arrangement\" or \"setting out \ntogether\". Traditionally it refer s to the branch of grammar \ndealing with the ways in which words, with or without \nappropriate inflections, are arranged to show connections of \nmeaning within the sentence.  (Matthews , 1982:1) . (p. 1). \nFor this project, there must be an analysis of sentence struct ure, and \nas well as semantics, S yntax plays a fundamental role in language in which \nwords are combined to form phrases, clauses and sentences.  \n1.2.30. Translation  \nAccording to Newmark  (1988): \nWhat is Translation? Often, though not by any means always, it \nis rendering the meaning of a text into another language in the \nway that the author intended the text. Common sense tells us \nthat this ought to be simple, as one ought to be able to say \nsomething as well in one language as in another. On the other \nhand, you may see it as complicated, artificial and fraudulent, \nsince by using another language you are pretending to be \nsomeone you are not. Hence in many types of text (legal, \nadministrative, dia lect, local, cultural) the temptation is to \ntransfer as many SL (Source Language) words to the T L \n(Target Language) as possible . (p. 5).  \nFor this study, this definition provides an easy understanding of what \nthis field involves. Besides, Translation has be come a fundamental tool to  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n32 \n transmit a  message from the source to the target language, from one culture \nto another, improving the communi cation process among  different societies.  \n  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n33 \n CHAPTER II  \n2. METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK  \n2. 1. Translation Techniques  \nThere ar e many translation techniques that can be applied on the \nprocess to transmit the information from the source into the target language \nand have an accurate final product ; the main techniques include: Borrowing, \nCalque, L iteral Translation, Transposition, Modulation, among others.  \nFirstly,  \nTo overcome a Lacuna, usually a M etalinguistic one (e.g. a new \ntechnical  process, and unknown concept, B orrowing is the \nsimplest of all translation methods. For instance, in order to \nintroduce the flavor of the SL culture into a translation, foreing \nterms may be used, e.g such as Russian words as \u2018roubles\u2019, \n\u2018datchas\u2019, and \u2018apparatchik\u2019, \u2018dollars\u2019, and \u2018party\u2019 from American \nEnglish, Mexican Spanish food names \u2018tequila\u2019 and \u2018tortillas\u2019, \nand so on.  (Munday & Hatim, 2004, p. 14 9) \n \nSo that B orrowing is the taking of words from any language without \ntranslation. Many English words are borrowed into other languages, and \nthere are some examples from our project:  \nThe radio show \u2018The Power Hour\u2019 is borrowed from the ST into \nthe TT.  \nTecnolog\u00eda Terminator, in which the word \u2018Terminator\u2019 is  \nborrowed from the ST into the TT.  \nOn the other hand , \nCalque is a special kind of borrowing whereby a language \nborrows an expression form of another, but then translates \nliterally each of its elements. The result is either: a lexical \ncalque, i.e. a calque which represents the syntactic structure of \nthe TL, whilst introducing a new mode of expression; or a  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n34 \n structural calque, which introduce a new construction into the \nlanguage . (Munday & Hatim, 2004, p. 1 49) \n \nHere is an example of an express ion that was originated by the literal \ntranslation of two terms without following Spanish grammar rules and \nbecame part of Spanish la nguage, and it is considered a calque from \nEnglish:   \nEnglish -Spanish Calque:  \nScience -fiction \u2013 Ciencia ficci\u00f3n   \nThere is another technique called Literal T ranslation. According to \nMunday and Hatim (2004), it is \"the direct transfer of a SL text into a \ngrammatically and idiomatically appropriate TL text in which the translators\u2019 \ntask is li mited to observing the adherence to the linguistic servitudes of the \nTL\u201d (p. 149). For example:  \nEnglish: The solution for cancer, diabetes, arthritis and other \ndiseases  \nSpanish: La soluci\u00f3n para el c\u00e1ncer, diabetes, artritis y otras \nenfermedades  \nIn addi tion, there is another techni que called Transposition  which, \naccording to Jamalimanesh and Rahkhoda ( 2009), Munday and Hatim (2004, \np.150) mentioned that it  \"involves replacing one word class with another \nwithout changing the meaning of the message. Beside s being a special \ntranslation procedure, T ransposition can also be applied within a language.\u201d \n(http://www.translationdirectory.com/articles/article2025.php ). For example:  \nST: But Garrett found this disturbing and confusing.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n35 \n TT: Esto fue inquietante y con fuso para Garrett.  \nST: Chemically -dependent fields  \nTT: Campos qu\u00edmico dependientes  \nIn concordance with  Jamalimanesh and Rahkhoda ( 2009, retrieved \nfrom http://www.translationdirector y.com/articles/article2025.php ), Munday \nand Hatim (2004, p.150) stated the following to describe this technique:  \nModulation is a variation of the form of the message, obtained \nby a change in the point of view. This change can be justified \nwhen, although a literal, or even transposed, translation results \nin a grammatically correct  utterance, it is considered unsuitable, \nunidi omatic or awkward in the TL.   \nFor example:  \nST: I did have the vaccines.  \nTT: S\u00ed fui vacunada.   \nST: You can choose not to smoke  \nTT: La gente puede optar por no fumar  \nOn the other hand, a ccording to Munday and  Hatim (2004) , \nequivalence is applied  when is used to render \u201ctwo texts using completely \ndifferent stylistic and structural methods. In such cases we are dealing with \nthe method which procedures equivalent texts\u201d For example:  \nST: Science is when you can put numbers to things . \nTT: Hacer ciencia significa analizar las cosas usando n\u00fameros .  \nST: W ho carries the torch of a way of life that is health care . \nTT: Defendiendo un estilo de vida que es el cuidado de la \nsalud.    \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n36 \n At last , and again according to Jamalimanes h and Rahkhoda ( 2009), \nMunday and Hatim (2004, p.151) indicated the following about this last \ntechnique:  \nAdaptation is the extreme limit of translation. It is used in those \ncases where the type of situation being referred to by the SL \nmessage is unknown in  the TL culture. In such cases \ntranslators have to create new situation that can be considered \nas being equivalent. Adaptation can, therefore, be described as \na special kind of equivalence, a situational equivalence. They \nare particularly frequent in the t ranslation of book and film titles . \n(http://www.translationdirectory.com/articles/article2025.php ). \nThere are not examples of this technique in our project, because this \nmovie is a documentary in which this type of technique has not been applied. \nBut there  are other examples from other sources:  \nA famous movie: \u2018(500) Days of Summer\u2019 in U.S. , \u2018(500)  d\u00edas \njuntos\u2019  in Spain  and \u2018 (500) d\u00edas con ella\u2019  in Hispanic America  \n\u2018The tooth fairy ' in U.S,  and 'El Rat\u00f3n de los Dientes ' or 'Rat\u00f3n \nP\u00e9rez ' in Spanish speaking countries.  \nIn addition to the translation techniques listed above, there are some \nother similar procedures which are an American model, such as Matching \nthat covers two specific processes called Equation and Substitution. The first \none refers to some form of direct equivalence, which means that is the same \nas literal translation previously mentioned . Equation is \u201cwhen an element of \nthe source text is rendered by a target text element deemed  the most \nstraightforward counterpart available; schematically, or more simply\u201d \n(Malone, 1988, p. 19). On the other hand, substitution is \u201cwhen a source text \nelement is rendered by a target element deemed as being other than the  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n37 \n most straightforward counte rpart available\u201d (Malone, 1988, p. 19). This \nmeans that substitution is when certain terms from some expressions of the \nST have to be substituted for most suitable ones into the TT in order to \ntransmit a better cultural meaning and connotations according t o the target \nreader.  \nThere is also another technique called Zigzagging that covers \nDivergence and Convergence. Divergence, \u201cwhereby an element of the \nsource text may be mapped onto any of two or more alternatives in the target \ntext, is a translational nexu s reflecting relative paradigmatic richness of the \ntarget resources compared with the source\u201d (Malone, 1988, p. 29). In this \ncase, this technique leads to the concept of one -to-many -equivalents \nbecause of the different lexical structuring between languages . For instance, \nfrom English to Spanish:  \nST: Infuriated to the point where they're leaving their seats, and \nthey're going out and becoming activists, and they're \ndemonstrating and writing letters.  \nTT: Enfurecidos hasta el punto de levantarse , salir y volv erse \nactivistas; est\u00e1n  protestando en las calles y escribiendo cartas .  \nIn this example, the term \u2018demostrating\u2019 from the ST is diverged into \n\u2018protestando en las calles\u2019 into the TT .  \nLinguistic, situational and stylistics clues will tell translators the c orrect \nmeaning and use of the range of alternatives to avoid ambiguity and other \nproblems.    \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n38 \n On the other hand, Convergence  \u201cas the mirror image to Divergence, \nat times provides a moment of respite to the translator since a paradigmatic \nopposition in the so urce language has no direct counterpart in the target \nlanguage\u201d (Malone, 1988, p. 36).  \nThis is the opposite of divergence, where varied source -language \nterms collapse into just one in the target language, rendering  a range of \nalternatives with a single lex ical item, for instance:   \nST: He refused to be paid off . \nTT: El no acept\u00f3 remuneraci\u00f3n alguna . \nIn this example the phrasal verb  \u2018to be paid off \u2019 from the ST is \nconverged into \u2018 remuneraci\u00f3n \u2019 in the TT.  \nFurthermore, Recrescence, which is another technique, i nvolves \nAmplification and R eduction. \u201cAmplification occurs when the TL uses more \nsignifiers to cover syntactic or lexical gaps\u201d (Molina & Hurtado, 2002, p. 4. \nRetrieved from http://www.erudit.org/revue/meta/2002/v47/n4/008033ar.pdf ). \nIt is the addition of some elements to the ST to facilitate the TT reader\u2019s \ncomprehension. It is carried out when certain items or components of the ST \nare not clear enough into the TT. For instance:  \nEnglish: Gulf War veterans  \nSpanish: Veteranos de la Guerra del G olfo \nIn this e xample, \"Gulf War veterans\" in the ST was amplified as \n\"Veteranos de la Guerra del Golfo\" into the TT due to the difference in the \ngrammatical structure in both languages  so it is suitable to  the TT .  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n39 \n On the other hand, \u201cReduction as the inverse of Amplific ation, is a \npattern whereby a source expression is partially trajected onto a target \ncounterpart and partially omitted from the trajection.\u201d ( Malone, 1988, p. 46). \nThis means that it is the omission of one or more elements in the target text \nconsidered unn ecessary and redundant.  For example:  \nEnglish : What seemed like a simple snack \"taken for granted\" \nin the garden had tremendous implications worldwide.  \nSpanish: Lo que parec\u00eda un simple refrigerio \"extra\u00eddo\" del \nhuerto, tendr\u00eda tremendas implicaciones a ni vel mundial.  \nIn this example, the expression \"taken for granted\" has been reduced \nto \"extra\u00eddo\" and just being used as a metaphoric term since it is almost \nunneeded because the term \"simple\" is giving the connotation of the  intended  \nmeaning.   \nAdditionally , there is one final and absolutely essential step for a \ntranslation to be complete, which is editing. There are two kinds of editing: \nbasic and stylistic. Firstly, basic editing is \u201cconcerned with eliminating outright \nerrors, anything from incorrect spell ing or punctuation, through grammatical \nconstructions to obscure, ambiguous or misleading sentential configurations\u201d. \n(S\u00e1ndor, Hervey, Higgins & Loughridge, 1995, p. 168). This type of editing \nfocuses on correcting, spelling mistakes, mismatch, the structu re of \ncollocations, among other mistakes within the translated text.  \nStylistic E diting , on the other hand,  \u201cpresupposes a text that is \nreasonable finished in such respect as literal meaning, grammar and spelling. \nIt is purely a process of tinkering with s tylistic effects in a TT\u201d (S\u00e1ndor,  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n40 \n Hervey, Higgins & Loughridge, 1995, p. 168). The function of stylistic editing \nis correcting mistakes related to stylistic features of languages in order to \nconvey an accurate message taking into account the connotative m eanings \nimplied in the TL. \u201dThe most central features for stylistic editing are \nconnotative meanings, because they require to be trigged by the context of \nthe TT alone\u201d (S\u00e1ndor  et al. , 1995, p. 169).  \nFinally, there are many useful tools on internet that he lp translators \nwork faster, such as large varieties of online translators, MTs ( Translation \nManagement Software) , dictionaries that can vary according to the different \nfields of study: medicine, nutrition, among others. One of the most famous \nand used onli ne translator machi nes around the world is Google T ranslate , \nwhich is a good option to translate vast amounts of information, and  it has \nimproved in accuracy over the last few years. Moreover, there are different \nkinds of dictionaries and encyclopedias; th e most common for general use \nare: thefreedictionary.com, a nswers.com, wordreference.com, among others . \nAlso, if the translator is going to carry out some medical translations , there \nare many available resources on the Internet with specialized terminology  \nthat contains medical, nutrition and health terms. There is a wide range of \nmedical dictionaries in various languages, as well as glos saries with medical \nterms. \"Some of the most useful basic medical information may, for instance \nbe found at sites such as  BioMedSearch, Free Medical Dictionary, Dorland's \nMedical Dictionary (Illustrated), the eMedicine Medical Dictionary, Stedman's \nMedical Dictionary or MT Desk\" . (Indian Scripts , n.d., para. 2) .  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n41 \n 2. 2. Annotations  \n2.2.1. About the Linguistic Field of Study  \nThe text studied in this research project has a medical scope in the \nnutrition and health field. It is a script of a documentary movie that was  \nwritten  and directed by Steve Kroschel, it is from Gerson Institute. The \nlinguistic field tends to be general, the re are lots of study fields within \nlanguages, but for this project we are going to focus on the medical field with \nspecific terminology that will be used and analyzed during the translation \nprocess.  \n2.2.2. About the Form of the Text  \n \nThe information intend ed to be translated is a documentary movie in \nwhich the text is a script about nutritional issues. There are dialogues divided \ninto sentences with time codes. This text contains scientific, descriptive and \npersuasive information about the Gerson Therapy, t he diet -based cure for \ncancer.  \n2.2.3. About the Contextual Features of the Text  \n \nHere is the familiarization process, the vocabulary within the text is \nmade up with medical, nutrition and health terms, and some other words that \ncan be found in other relate d texts, but we have translating them according to \nthe context. Examples:   \n- Retort: crematorio  \n- Roller coaster: altibajos   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n42 \n - Blood pressure: presi\u00f3n sangu\u00ednea , etc.  \n2.3. ANALYSIS OF LINGUISTIC ANNOTATIONS FROM THE  \nTRANSLATED MOVIE SCRIPT  \n2.3.1. Metaphors  Problems  \n\"The main and one serious purpose of metaphor is to describe an \nentity, event or quality more comprehensively and concisely in a more \ncomplex way than is possible by using literal language. \" (Newmark, 1988, p. \n84). \nFurthermore, metaphoric languag e is a common characteristic of \nliterary oriented texts. In our source there are some analogies that \ncorrespond to this category, which will be described herei n: \n1. As we can see in the table below, in lines 1 and 2, the source offers \na philosophical view of how human beings approach life and its \ninterpretation, how it is perceived as light. We have rendered a \ncommunicative transfer since linguistic equation needs to be achieved in \norder to get to the target audience; i.e. Spanish speaking addressees with \ndifferent socio -cultural background. We opted for a more culture -bound \napproach to transmit the original message in a natural and easier way to be \nunderstood by the intended audience.  \n \nSource Text (ST)  \n \n1 The infinite depths of darkness  \n2 be sliced open by light.   \nTarget Text (TT)  \n \n1 La m\u00e1s densa oscuridad puede ser  \n2 traspasada por penetrantes rayos de luz.  \n2. In lines 3, 4 and 5, we can notice that the philosophical point of view \ncontinues since \"life\" is interpreted as a \"miracle\" and with only \"one deli cate  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n43 \n vessel\" is enough to keep going throughout \"the finite expanses\". Here, we \nhave also rendered a communicative transfer since some linguistic equation \nneeded to be achieved in order to get to the target audience; however, we \nhave also applied some of t he semantic translation since there are terms like \n\"vessel\" that has several different meanings depending on the context; but in \nthis specific situation, figuratively speaking, we needed to go further in the \ninterpretation and tried to find the most accura te and consistent translation so \nthe target language can take it just as the original message meant. Besides, \nwe used Reordering as one of the translations techniques learned in our \nacademic and internship programs. Here is necessary to use this specific \ntechnique since the target script is intended for a Spanish -speaking \ncommunity, and there are some linguistic and grammatical order differences \nbetween these two languages, i.e. in how the sentences are structured \naccordlingly. That is the case of the phras e \"miracle called 'life'\" which was \nmoved to the end of the sentence in order to provide the exact meaning \ngiven by the original message. Besides, we can notice that the ST is \ndifferently structured from the TT.  \n \nSource Text (ST)  \n \n3 And for the finite exp anses of the  \n4 miracle called \"life,\" it has but one  \n5 delicate vessel.   \nTarget Text (TT)  \n \n3 Y a trav\u00e9s de una delicada arteria, se  \n4 dan paso las finitas extensiones del  \n5 milagro llamado \"vida\" . \n3. Continuing with this analysis, in the following case, w e can tell that \nin line 8, the phrase \"walking around\" used alone could have many options if \ntranslated into the Target Language, such as: \"dando una vuelta, paseando\", \netc. However, within the context, we had to convey the same meaning  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n44 \n coming from the ori ginal text by going deeper in the analysis and using a \nfigurative form in order to obtain the most accurate rendering possible. As we \ncan see in the example below, if we follow the context of the original \nlanguage, we can observe that \"walking around\" in t his case means \"andan \npor ah\u00ed\", but the translation just like is still missing something there, so that \nthe message gets completed from the Source to the TL. Therefore, we went \neven deeper and used Amplification as another translation technique, we \nadded \" tan tranquilos\" in order to get the same effect in the intended \naudience as the original one generates. Practically, the whole sentence has \nbeen reordered, so the order of lines 3, 4 and 5 does not coincide from one \nlanguage to the other. However, if Reord ering Technique was not applied in \nthis sentence, it would have been almost impossible to express the intended \nmessage to the TT.  \n \nSource Text (ST)  \n \n6 Yet that seemed absurd when  \n7 considering that many people are  \n8 walking around with amalgams  \n9 in their mouths.   \nTarget Text (TT)  \n \n6 Sin embargo, parece absurdo si se  \n7 considera que muchas personas  \n8 andan por ah\u00ed tan tranquilos con amalgamas  \n9 en sus bocas.  \n \n4. In line 13,  the source text offers a figurative view of \u201cgenetically \nengineered foods\u201d, that ac cording to the author\u2019s point of view this kind of \nfood has a negative effect in people\u2019s life, and for this expression to be \nrendered into the target language has to be adapted for the target audience \nto understand the implicit meaning of this idea. Since  this metaphor \u201cgenie is \nout of the bottle\u201d has a figurative sense in which the author is trying to state \nthat \u201cengineer ed food\u201d is too good to be true , which means that is apparently  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n45 \n good  and inoffensive , but it could be dangerous if people ingest it.  Therefore, \n\u201cCaja de Pandora\u201d is the best rendering in this case because it refers to \nsomething that could carry some negative consequences.   In order to fulfill \nthe expectations of the target audience, this is the most suitable translation:  \n \nSource Text  \n \n10 O ne of the greatest misconceptions  \n11 we have about genetically  \n12 engineered  foods is that  \n13 genie is out of the bottle .  \nTarget Text  \n \n10 Una de las creencias m\u00e1s err\u00f3neas  \n11 que tenemos sobre los alimentos  \n12 transg\u00e9nicos es que son como  \n13 una caja de pandora.  \n \n5. In lines 17 and 18,  the expression \u201croller coaster\u201d is used in a \nsymbolic sense, and according to the source text this phrase means that the \nperson involved in this matter is experiencing mixed emotions, such as ups \nand downs. This metaphor i s commonly used in English in an informal and \nidiomatic sense when referring to this kind of feelings, and regarding the \ncontext the best translation in Spanish would be \u201caltibajos\u201d, so that here we \nalso used Convergence from \u2018roller coaster\u2019 that was rend ered into one \nlexical item \u2018altibajos\u2019. Besides, the structure of the whole sentence is also \nchanged in order to convey the meaning accurately. And the most suitable \nequivalent according to the context is:  \n \nSource Text  \n \n14 Since I've been here, inside myse lf  \n15 feel hugely different: much stronger,  \n16 physically, and I've lost the nausea.  \n17 I've had, uh - it's a little bit of a            \n18 roller coaster .  \nTarget Text  \n \n14 Desde que estoy aqu\u00ed, me siento muy  \n15 diferente por dentro, mucho m\u00e1s  \n16 fuert e f\u00edsicamente, y ya no tengo  \n17 nauseas. He tenido algunos  \n18 altibajos.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n46 \n 6. In line 20, the source offers a figurative view of people\u2019s lifestyle \nwithin this expression, and it may cause a translation problem since there is \nnot a specific equivalent for this expression in the target language , and for \nthis reason it is more difficult to carry out a m etaphorical translation from the \nsource to the target text. In addition, \u201c what side of the tracks you lived at the \nend\u201d has a figurative meaning that denotes t he way people live, and \naccording to this, the rendering from the ST into the TT is the following:  \n \n \nSource Text  \n \n19 It won't matter where you came from, or on  \n20 what side of the tracks you lived at the end . \n  \nTarget Text  \n \n19 Al fina l, no importar\u00e1 de don de viniste,  \n20 o la forma en que viviste . \n7. In line 24, the expression \u201c the torch of a way of life\u201d is expressed \nthrough figurative language, where they are referring to a way of life from a \nperson who is leading a particular lifestyle which is health ca re according to \nthe source text, and the author has used this particular metaphor that is an \neye-catching expression which causes a positive impact on the reader, and \nat the same time, it highlights the fact that the woman keeps a clear position. \nThe most suitable rendering is:  \n \nSource Text  \n \n21 How could he possibly forget a woman  \n22 who carries on her father's work  \n23 relentlessly, against all opposition,  \n24 who carries the torch of a way of life  \n25 that is health care .  \nTarget Text  \n \n21\u00bfC\u00f3mo podr\u00eda Garrett  olvidar a una mujer  \n22 que incansablemente  contin\u00faa con el  \n23 trabajo de su padre,  contra toda  \n24 oposici\u00f3n , defendiendo un  estilo de vida  \n25 que es el cuidado de la salud.  \n 8. In lines 26 and 27, this figurative expression mentioned by the \nauthor of the  text is an understandable expression at first sight for anyone  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n47 \n who has knowledge of both languages: English and Spanish, however, it is \nimportant to consider certain things when translating it, for instance, there are \nsome lexical items that have to be re ndered equivalently for the target \naudience to get an accurate meaning of this idea, so that in order to transmit \nthe same metaphorical sense accurately from the ST into the TT the verb \n\u201cact\u00fae\u201d was the best option within this sentence. Therefore, here is t he \nproposed translation:  \n \nSource Text  \n \n26 My words of advice to you, b ring the \n27 power of plants into your  body.  \n  \nTarget Text  \n \n26 Mi consejo es: deja que el poder de las \n27 plantas act\u00fae en  tu cue rpo. \n \n2.3.2. Linguistic Translation Problems  \nLinguistic T ranslation Problems occur due to differences between the \nsource (original) and target languages. In some languages, one word can \nhave different meanings (i.e. there is ambiguity), and the translator needs to \nbe careful to choose the exact meaning that is a ppropriate to the context. \nThere also may be some problems caused by structural or lexical differences \nas well as by the existence of idioms and collocations.  A linguistic translation \nerror is any type of grammatical error in language structure.  \n9. In the next case, firstly, there is a Linguistic Translation issue since \nin English, a general statement is grammatically structured in plural, while the \nSpanish structure is in singular. As we can note, in line 28 of the ST, the term \n\"sensitivities\" is written i n plural, and when it is conveyed to the TT, it is \nwritten in singular \"una aguda  sensibilidad\". If the translator does not have \nthe knowledge of this type of translation technique may not be able to make  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n48 \n that difference and the TT will not be as accurate as it should be. There is \nalso some type of differences in the two languages when it comes to \ndetermine the real meaning of the original text since English is a more direct \nand practical language compared to Spanish that is less practical and less \ndirect, reason for which, sometimes it needs more explanation in order  to \ndeliver the desired meaning:  \n \nSource Text (ST)  \n \n28 For Garrett, his sensitivities about  \n29 nature are acute.   \nTarget Text (TT)  \n \n28 Garrett posee una aguda sensibilidad  \n29 hacia  la naturaleza . \n10. Proceeding with the next example, we can observe that there is an \nissue with the order of whole sentence since we had to change it completely \nwith the purpose of offering a better possibility to communicate the same \nmeaning coming from the mother la nguage. In lines 30 and 31, we could \nhave chosen the more traditional way of translating this message: \"Even a \n15-year-old could find the text a good read\" as \"Incluso un chico de 15 a\u00f1os \npodr\u00eda encontrar una buena lectura en el texto\". However, if it have  been \ndone that way, the message would have not been transmitted faithfully to the \nintended audience. Therefore, we had to go further in the translation and use \nthe techniques learned previously, in this specific case, we applied \nReordering which make it m ore natural and closer to the ST: \"  El texto ser\u00eda \nbuena lectura , incluso para un chico de 15 a\u00f1os\". If we read the original \nversion, we could tell that the intentional message is to emphasize the fact \nthat \"even a 15 -year-old boy could find the text inter esting\", which means that \nthe main part is that the boy is pretty young but he still may find the text  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n49 \n interesting due to its importance, and if the sentence is reordered when \ntranslated in the TT, we consider that the real intention of the ST is achieved.  \n \nSource Text (ST)  \n \n30 Even a 15 -year-old could find  \n31 the text a good read.   \nTarget Text (TT)  \n \n30 El texto ser\u00eda buena lectura , \n31 incluso para un chico de 15 a\u00f1os.  \n \n11. The next illustration shows how a translation can be done from \none language to anot her using Reordering as well but taking the last phrase \n\"to start with\" in line 35 in the ST, and placing it in the middle of the sentence \nin the TT as shown in lines 33 and 34. This issue is very common in these \ntype of situations since in English, the gr ammatical order of the sentence is \npresented just as it is in the ST, but if we want to do the same way when \ntranslating into Spanish, the message could be somehow confusing for the \nTT audience. Translators should be very careful when rendering any text, \nthey should pay very close attention to every single detail to facilitate the \nreception of the original version of the message.  \n \nSource Text (ST)  \n \n32 The boy wasn't sure how that would \n33 be accomplished, but he did draw out  \n34 an analogy between gold mini ng and  \n35 human nature, to start with.   \nTarget Text (TT)  \n \n32 El chico no estaba seguro de c\u00f3mo  \n33 lograr eso , pero para  empezar  dedujo  \n34 una analog\u00eda entre  las minas de oro y  \n35 la naturaleza humana.  \n \n12. As shown in lines 36, 37 and 38, we also applied the very common \ntechnique, Reordering, since it is convenient in this specific case too. If we \nused the same order in the TT as presented in the ST, the results would have \nnot being as expressed originally, and the translation would have been \ninappropriate , and the translator would appear unprofessional since he would  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n50 \n not be able to prove that he is knowledgeable enough to render any kind of \ntranslation. In this example, the last phrase \"would seem absurd\" in the ST \nwas moved to the very beginning in the TT  in order to provide the same \neffect transmitted in the ST to the intended audience.  \n \nSource Text (ST)  \n \n36 For the American Dental Association to \n37 continue to insist that amalgams are  \n38 safe would seem absurd.   \nTarget Text (TT)  \n \n36 Ser\u00eda absurdo que la Asociaci\u00f3n  \n37 Dental Americana contin\u00fae i nsistiendo \n38 que las amalgamas son saludables . \n13. In the subsequent case in point, we can notice that we applied \nReordering, in lines 41 and 42 of the ST compared with lines 41 and 42 of \nthe TT, we are able to di stinguish the order of the phrases \"mercury vapor\" in \nline 41 of the ST while in the TT is located in line 42. The same thing, but \nbackwards, happens with the phrase \"Dr. Roger Eichman\". Also, as shown in \nthe ST (line 42), the term \"gave\" is the last word of the sentence; however, in \nthe TT, it was moved to a different position (see line 41). In addition to that, \nthe second half of the sentence was changed from Passive Voice (in English) \nto Active Voice (in Spanish) due to linguistic differences of these tw o \nlanguages. Amplification is another technique applied in this example, as we \nsee in line 41 in the ST, the phrase \" methlyl mercury vapor\" is rendered as \n\"vapores met\u00edlicos de mercurio\" in line 42 in the TT; and of course, we should \nnot forget the syntact ic linguistic part that this phrase \"mercury vapor\" \nrepresents in English (singular) and when it is translated into Spanish, it is \ntranslated as \"vapores (plural) de mercurio\".   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n51 \n  \nSource Text (ST)  \n \n39 He couldn't seem to overcome the  \n40 disturbing chemistry lesson about  \n41 deadly methyl mercury vapor that  \n42 Dr. Roger Eichman gave.   \nTarget Text (TT)  \n \n39 \u00c9l parec\u00eda no poder superar una  \n40 perturbadora clase de qu\u00edmica  \n41 del Dr. Roger Eichman sobre  \n42 los mortales vapores  met\u00edlicos  de mercurio.  \n14. In lines 43 and 44, in  the expression \u201cshoveling out of barrels\u201d the \nterm \u201cshoveling\u201d is used as a verb in the SL, and this verb does not exist in \nthe TL, so that here we have a linguistic problem that has to be solved by \nchanging the SL verb into another part of s peech, such as a noun in this \ncase: \u201c palas \u201d, which is the most appropriate according to the previous context \nof the ST, where a women is talking about what she used to do in her job. \nBesides, there are some other parts of  speech, such us: \u201csacaba\u201d within t he \nsentence in orde r to convey the whole idea, and naturalizing the ST sentence \ninto the TT. Therefore, this expression would be rendered with the most \nsuitable equivalents changing its structure:  \n \nSource Text  \n \n43 I was basically shoveling aspartame  \n44 out  of barrels  \n  \nTarget Text  \n \n43 B\u00e1sicamente yo sacaba el aspartame  \n44 de los barriles con palas . \n \n \n15. In lines 45 and 46, this sentence goes after the expression \nmentioned above and both are related to each other, in which \u201cby the \nshovels\u201d, from a linguis tic point of view, is structurally changed with different \nparts of speech , and it is rendered as  \u201cgrandes cantidades \u201d. This expression \nis quite difficult to render into Spanish since \u201cshovels\u201d means \u201cpalas\u201d, and \nwithin the context it refers to a great amou nt of a chemical substance , and \nthe following translation  shows the most accurate equivalence :  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n52 \n  \nSource Text  \n \n45 And you were using it by the shovels,  \n46 weren't you?   \nTarget Text  \n \n45 Y lo utilizabas en grandes cantidades,  \n46 \u00bfverdad ? \n16. In lines 47 and 4 8, this expression has been rendered according to \nsome explanations that were given in the previous context of the text in which \nthey are discussing about some \u201ctabs\u201d, and in order to be more explicit and \nnaturalize the sentence into Spanish, we have used amplification by adding \nthe words \u201ct iritas \u201d and \u201cl\u00e1minas\u201d to explain about what exactly they are \nreferring to, so that the target audience can perfectly understand the \nmessage. As a result, the translation we have used is:  \n \nSource Text  \n \n47 Yes, um,  the qui ck dissolve,   \n48 like the Listerine ? \n  \nTarget Text  \n \n47 S\u00ed, bueno, las tiritas  de disoluci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida,  \n48 como las l\u00e1minas Listerine ? \n17. In lines 49 and 50 , the structure of the ST is different from that of \nthe TL, therefore, it has to be syntactically and  semantically adapted into \nSpanish, using the appropriate terms with a communicative sense. Moreover, \nthere is some Reduction used,  in which some implicit content from the ST is \ntransmitted into an explicit message into the TT by eliminating  some  terms  \nfrom the original text and even changing the grammatical structure  from \npassive to active voice  into the TT ; for example in English is shown as \"Now \nshe became injured  as a result of using MSG\" , while  in Spanish is shown as \"  \nElla se lastim\u00f3 por usar GMS\". It  has been  rendered into the most \nappropriate structure of the TL  in order to make it easier for  the intended \naudience :  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n53 \n  \nSource Text  \n \n49 Now she became injured as a result  \n50 of using MSG, but she didn't really  \n51 use it; it was done to her.  \n  \nTarget Text  \n \n49 Ella se lastim\u00f3  por usar GMS,  \n50 aunque en realidad no lo usaba, s e lo \n51 causaron a ella . \n2.3.3. Text-specific Translation Problems  \nText-specific translation problems  are specific to a particular text or to \nthe particular way an author expresses him/h erself or refers to something. To \nsolve these problems, the translator needs to understand what the author is \ntrying to communicate with the words he/she uses.  \n18. The following scenario illustrates one of the typical problems when \ntranslating a movie, tha t is when translators use only the script without \nwatching the movie at the same time. Like in the case below, in line 52 in the \nST \"a simple snack\" refers to a \"carrot\" that Garret (the boy) got from the \ngarden, cleans it with his T -shirt and eats it. And  since that part of the movie \nwas showing how a piece of vegetable (in this case, a carrot) could make a \ndifference in the health of a human being to the point to cause \"  tremendous \nimplications worldwide\" as it says the TT in line 54. Of course, it was st ill \ntranslated into Spanish as \"simple refrigerio\" as shown in line 52 in the TT, \nbut, in order to understand the real meaning of it, we had to watch the movie.  \n \nSource Text (ST)  \n \n52 What seemed like a simple snack  \n53 taken for granted in the garden had  \n54 tremendous implications worldwide.   \nTarget Text (TT)  \n \n52 Lo que parec\u00eda un simple refrigerio  \n53 extra\u00eddo del huerto,  tendr\u00eda  \n54 tremendas implicaciones a nivel mundial.  \n \n19. Here is another case of a movie translation issue, and it is about \nthis particul ar phrase \"such as this porcupine\" in line 57 in the ST, translated  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n54 \n as \"como es el caso de este puercoesp\u00edn\" in the TT. The problem here is that \nthe \"porcupine\" that the script referred to was not mentioned previously at all, \nand in the script said \"such a s this  porcupine\", but without watching the \nmovie, it was quite difficult to know which \"porcupine\" the script was talking \nabout. The movie shows a baby \"porcupine\" as the young creature as it is \nexplained in line 56 of both texts (ST and TT). Translators should be aware \nthat a movie translation carries out more details as it does a traditional \ntranslation. Translators must watch the movie at the same time they read the \nscript of it because the combination of both will make such a great difference \nwhen rend ering any of these particular type of movie translations.  \n \nSource Text (ST)  \n \n55 He understood how important it is to  \n56 feed a young creature, such as this  \n57 porcupine, the right mix of foods, or  \n58 that creature would succumb quickly,  \n59 especially in it s first few days of life.   \nTarget Text (TT)  \n \n55 \u00c9l entendi\u00f3 cu\u00e1n importante es alimentar  \n56 a un cachorro , como es el caso de este  \n57 puercoesp\u00edn, con la mezcla exacta de  \n58 alimentos, o esa criatura morir\u00eda r\u00e1pidamente , \n59 sobre todo en sus primeros d\u00edas de vida.  \n20. In lines 61 and 62  the expression \u201cobesity and oversized people\u201d \nrepresents some problems when rendering it into Spanish according to our \nregister, which refers to a particular social setting and the way we say things. \nIn the Spanish -communit y, for instance in Ecuador, it is kind of rude to say \n\u201cuna persona obesa\", using such informal language. That is why in oral and \nwritten communication people from here tend to use more appropriate terms \nto say this kind of expressions in order to avoid rud eness and negative \nimplications these terms may involve according to our cognitive perception of \nthings. There is also Deletion or Reduction in the last part of the sentence in \nwhich the word \u201cdeeper\u201d was deleted because it was redundant within the  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n55 \n context  and we do not use that word in Spanish to refer to an oversized \nperson, so it was not necessary to render it into the TT. According to this \nanalysis the most suitable translation would be:  \n \nSource Text  \n \n60 One of the issues we have with  \n61 oversized, uh - obesity and oversized  \n62 people is that they're very wide, and  \n63 they're also very much thicker, or deeper.  \n  \nTarget Text  \n \n60 Uno de los problemas que tenemos  \n61 con las personas que sufren de  \n62 sobrepeso , es que son muy anchas, y  \n63 tambi\u00e9n mucho m \u00e1s gruesas.  \n \n2.3.4. Pragmatic translation problems  \nAccording to Tolnai (2011), \u201cPragmatic problems refer to any issues \nrelating to time, place and context. The best way to illustrate pragmatic \nproblems is through national institutions whose names and org anization vary \nfrom one culture to another (e.g. American State Departments vs. British \nMinistries)\".  (http://tolnaitranslations.com/2011/09/24/dealing -with-translation -\nproblems/ )   \n21. In the following example, there is a semantic problem since \n\"skeletons \" can be misinterpreted or mistranslated from the ST into the TT as \n\"esqueleto\" which is the first rendering that comes into mind; however, we \nhad to go further and deeper in the translation techniques and found the most \naccurate representation of it withi n the context in order to offer a suitable and \nmore appropriate rendering to convey the exact meaning coming from the \nST. In line 65 of both texts, we are able to see how \"skeletons\" have been \ntranslated as \"irregularidades\", which makes the context flows easily and it \nwould definitely facilitate the translation of the original message to the \nintended audience.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n56 \n  \nSource Text (ST)  \n \n64 He dug for more information, and then \n65 more skeletons were uncovered.   \nTarget Text (TT)  \n \n64 Busc\u00f3 m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n, y as\u00ed \n65 aparecieron m\u00e1s irregularidades.  \n \n22. In the next situation, we have applied another quite common \ntechnique, i.e.  Amplification, which allows us translators to go further into the \ntranslation and discover a better option of rendering, that is the case of  line \n67 in the ST where it says \"fluoride is still debated\". In order to convey the \nsame meaning, we needed to add some extra words to be faithful to the \ncontext rather than the syntactic part of the sentence. Grammatically \nspeaking, we would not have bee n able to express the message as accurate \nas it shows in line 67 of the TT \"fluoruro sigue en discusi\u00f3n\". The only way to \ndo it was using this convenient technique since there are pragmatic \ntranslation differences between English and Spanish. These two lan guages \ncould be semantically compatible if we as translators apply techniques that \nhelp us to find a good solution for any kind of problems that we may \nencounter in the whole translation process. Therefore, translators should be \nwell prepared and informed about all the possibilities and the different \ntechniques that are available online or in textbooks.  \n \nSource Text (ST)  \n \n66 And yet in present day, the subject of \n67 fluoride is still debated.   \nTarget Text (TT)  \n \n66 Incluso en la actualidad , el tema de l \n67 fluoruro sigue en discusi\u00f3n.  \n23. The next case shows an issue that is very common when \ntranslating a dialogue or, as in this example, a movie script from English to \nSpanish. That is when in English the gender has to be specified by adding  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n57 \n the word \"male\" or  \"female\" in most cases to avoid confusion. In Spanish, it is \nspecified when mentioning the noun, as in this example \"presentador\"; it is \nalready telling us that the person is a \"male\". For the solution of this \nrendering problem we have applied a technique  called Reduction since it \nwould redundant to translate it as \"Presentador Masculino de Televisi\u00f3n\". \nThat would not be accepted in the TT. Therefore in line 68 of the ST shows \nas \"Male Television Announcer\" and in line 68 of the TT is translated as \n\"Presen tador de Televisi\u00f3n\" which is enough to identify that the announcer is \na male.  \n \nSource Text (ST)  \n \n68 MALE TELEVISION ANNOUNCER:  \n  \nTarget Text (TT)  \n \n68 PRESENTADOR DE TELEVISI\u00d3N:  \n \n24. This specific example points out the expression of the person who \nis tal king in the documentary movie, then a Communicative rendering is \nappropriate within this context in order to illustrate in the TT exactly how the \nmeaning comes from the original text. In lines 69 and 70 of the ST have been \nalso applied Reordering since the  phrase \"if it gets over\" was moved to the \nbeginning of the sentence in lines 69 and 70 of the TT in order to offer a \nprecise rendering to convey the meaning from the original message.  \n \nSource Text (ST)  \n \n69 Uh, they'll close the factory if it gets  \n70 over 100 and evacuate .  \nTarget Text (TT)  \n \n69 Mm, con 100 ya cerrar\u00edan la f\u00e1brica  \n70 y evacuar\u00edan . \n \n25. In line 74, there is a semantic problem in the ST in which the term \n\u201cdemonstrating\u201d can cause confusion for the translator because the first  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n58 \n option would be translating this word using a dictionary entry or a literal \ntranslation, such us \u201cdemostrando\u201d, but according to the context and the rest \nof lexical items involved in the sentence, this term has a particular meaning \nthat goes beyond any dictionary word whe n rendering it into the TT. Also, we \nhave used Divergence in which an element of the source text: \n\u201cdemonstrating\u201d has some other alternatives to be translated, and has been \nrendered into more than one lexical item using the most appropriate terms to \nconvey  a communicative meaning in the target text. In this case, the target \nlexicon presents more lexical items for encoding the meaning of that specific \nword within this text. Therefore, the most appropriate translation is:  \n \nSource Text  \n \n71 Infuriated to the po int where they're  \n72 leaving their seats, and they're going  \n73 out and becoming activists, and they're  \n74 demonstrating and writing letters.  \n  \nTarget Text  \n \n71 Enfurecidos hasta el punto de  \n72 levantarse, salir y volverse activistas ; \n73 est\u00e1n  protestando en las calles y  \n74 escribiendo cartas.  \n \n26. Here we have applied Modulation, because there is a variation of \nthe form of the SL message. According to our point of view, we have decided \nthat  one part of the sentence could be changed grammatically from a  \npassive  into a n active voice, making it a  more natural rendering as it \nhappened in lines 7 6 and 77  of the ST : \u201cnot all the stuff that's been \nadvertised \u201d will not sound so acceptable  if it is transferred into the TT  using \nthe same type of voice; therefore, i n line 77, it was rendered as \u201cno eso que \npromocionan \u201d is more suitable for the intended audience . There is also \nAmplification  used in the last part of the expression in line 79 of both texts, in \nwhich \u201call nonsense science fiction\u201d needed some additional and important  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n59 \n lexical items to complete the whole meaning within the context, such as  \u201ctodo \neso es disparate de ciencia ficci\u00f3n \u201d where the extra  element \"disparate\" was \nadded to  the TT text to make it more accurate so it sounds more natural to \nthe intended  audience . According to this, our proposed translation is:  \n \nSource Text  \n \n75 Genetic engineering today means only  \n76 one thing - not all the stuff that's been  \n77 advertised, all the myths about more  \n78 food, more nutritious food, tastier food  \u2013 \n79 all nonse nse science fiction.   \nTarget Text  \n \n75 La ingenier\u00eda gen\u00e9tica hoy en d\u00eda  significa  \n76 una sola cosa  \u2013 no eso que  promocionan,  \n77 los mitos sobre abundancia, alimentos  \n78 m\u00e1s nutritivos, y de mejor sabor \u2013 \n79 todo eso es disparate de ciencia ficci\u00f3n.  \n \n27. Here , we have used some Amplification, as we can see in lines 80 \nand 81 of both languages,  where it says \"to food that is local\",  when we \nrendered it into the TT as \"a los alimentos producidos localmente\", there is \nan important  lexical item that needed to be added to the TT which is \n\"producidos\" so that the message is given in the most proper and acceptable \nway to match the meaning coming from the ST, and the same thing \nhappened in the last item \"local\", which went from being an adjective in the \nST to an ad verb in the TT \"localmente\" . Since there are many lexical and \ngrammatical difference s between both languages, we had to adequate  the \nmessage accordingly in order to make sense. Therefore, the use of  this \nimportant technique allows  us to get the most approp riate rendering to \nconvey the same message given in  the original text . This way,  the translated \ntext is fluent and sounds more natural  . The most suitable translation is the \nfollowing:   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n60 \n  \nSource Text  \n \n80 They're  saying, \"Yes,\" to food that is  \n81 local,  that is appropriate scale, that is  \n82 humane, that's biodiverse, and  \n83 that's socially just.  \n  \nTarget Text  \n \n80 Est\u00e1n diciendo, \"S\u00ed\" a los alimentos  \n81 producidos localmente a una escala  \n82 apropiada, que es m\u00e1s humana, biodiversa  \n83 y socialmente justa.  \n28. In lines 8 5 and 8 6, they are using an informal expression \u201cwas \nright in line to work\u201d that refers to someone who is selected, for being a \nsuccessful and professional person, to do a specific job. In this part, the word \n\u201cline\u201d has many dictionary entries t hat have nothing to do with the context if it \nis translated in isolation, and that is why it is important to use a contextual \ntranslation. This expression has been amplified with some extra elements to \nachieve a communicate translation into the TT. Further more, there is \nNaturalization when rendering the information for the translation to look \nnatural taking into account the target audience. According to the analysis \nmentioned above, the most suitable rendering would be:  \n \nSource Text  \n \n84 As a highly -paid and  highly -respected  \n85 food engineer, Carol was right  \n86 in line to work with this  \n87 dangerous substance.   \nTarget Text  \n \n84 Siendo una  ingeniera en alimentos bien  \n85 remunerada y respetada, Carol era la  \n86 persona m\u00e1s adecuada  para trabajar  \n87 con esta sustancia peligrosa.  \n \n29. In the ST, line 92 , there is Reduction because the expression \u201cth at \nmay catch on fire\u201d , on this case, became irrelevant and repetitive when \nrendering it into the TT, so that it is omitted since redundancy is not \nappropriate in Sp anish language in most contexts. Besides, the term \u201cretort\u201d \nhas several dictionary entries which do not convey the same meaning from \nthe original context, therefore, the most accurate translation of the ST word  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n61 \n \u201cretort\u201d is \u201ccrematorio\u201d, for the t arget read er to understand the original  \nmessage.  In addition, note that we have used Reduction and Amplification to \nconvey the most suitable rendering for the intended audience  in lines 91, 92 \nand 93 of the ST. T his expression \"because of all the excess body fluids that \nmay catch on fire, and also cause the retort to burn down\" became  \"debido al \nexceso de fluidos corporales combustibles que pueden hacer que el \ncrematorio tambi\u00e9n se queme\" : \n \nSource Text  \n \n88 Also, if they can do that, they have to be  \n89 very careful of  how they process the body  \n90 in the retort to prevent the retort from  \n91 catching on fire, because of all the excess  \n92 body fluids that may catch on fire, and  \n93 also cause the retort to burn down.  \n  \nTarget Text  \n \n88 Y cuando pueden hacerlo, tienen que  \n89 tener mucho cuidado al procesar el  \n90 cuerpo en el crematorio para evitar  \n91 un incendio; debido al exceso de fluidos  \n92 corporales  combustibles  que pueden  \n93 hacer que el crematorio tambi\u00e9n se queme . \n \n2.3.5. Cultural Translation Problems  \nCultural Tran slation Problems are caused by the different way people \nexpress themselves in the two cultures involved (source and target audience) \nbecause, as we know, every culture has its own customs, norms, principles, \nand so on.  \n30. In line 9 5, the use of \u201cup\u201d in th e expression \"up in Alaska\" in the \nST represents a cultu ral problem in the TT because t he translation of \"up\" in \nSpanish is physical location \"arriba\",  while what the speaker in the ST \nactually wants to indicate is that Alaska is geographically located in the \nnorth ern part of the country. The use of the term \"up\" to denote \"up north\" is \ncustomary in the United States because they are used to using maps more \nthan in most of the Spanish -speaking cultures. Therefore, in this specific  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n62 \n case, the term \"up\" was el iminated using the Reduction technique into the \ntarget language  because the geographical location of Alaska is already \nknown.  \n \nSource Text  \n \n94 This would actually be quite nice for  \n95 the cabin up in Alaska in the summer . \n  \nTarget Text  \n \n94 En realidad,  esto ser\u00eda excelente para         \n95 la caba\u00f1a en Alaska en  el verano.  \n \n31. In line s 96 and  97, this phrase  \u201cthe first that went, blood pressure\u201d \ninvolves some  cultural problems becau se the English -speaking culture is \nmore direct and practical with the use o f their language than the Spanish -\nspeaking one is.  There are  some  terms in English that can be even omitted \nand the message will still be understanda ble or it will be  already  implicit \nwithin the context.  If we follow  this example , we can notice that they a re \ntalking about \u201c high blood pressure \u201d without using the term \"high\" , and when \nthey say \"the first that went\" refers to \"diminish\" without really using it; \ntherefore, in order to achieve a translation into Spanish at the readership\u2019s \nlevel, it is important  to use some cultural modification and translate it as \" lo \nprimero que les disminuye es la presi\u00f3n sangu\u00ednea\"  so that the Spanish -\nspeaking audience can identify  what exactly they are talking  about as it is in \nthis specific case where the ST has been cultur ally adapted into the target \ntext since it  was necessary in order to  convey the most appropriate idea:  \n \nSource Text  \n \n96 Patients that come here, the first that  \n97 went, blood pressure.  \n  \nTarget Text  \n \n96 A los pacientes que vienen aqu\u00ed, lo  primero   \n97 que les disminuye es la presi\u00f3n  sangu\u00ednea.  \n \n  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n63 \n CHAPTER III  \n3. ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS  \n3.1. Justification  \nAccording to  Bill Handel , Vice President of Sales & Marketing  of \nGerson Health Media , there is a lot of information about the natural health \ntreatment named t he Gerson Therapy which needs to be translated into \nSpanish. This material includes movies, books, catalogs, and web -pages. He \nsays that The Beautiful Truth  is also a documentary movie in particular that \nneeds to be transla ted to benefit  the Spanish -speaking community . This \nmovie will teach us about a therapy that has helped many patients to \novercome their health problems by eating properly and get ting enough doses \nof nutrients.  \nIn accordance with  the Gerson Health Media website , there are s ome \nreal testimonies which show proof that this therapy works: Here is an  \nexample, a s mentioned in the movie \"Dying to Have Known\", also \ncopyrighted by Gerson Media (www. GersonM edia.com): \" A Japanese \nmedical school professor who cured himself of liver canc er over 15 years \nago, a lymphoma patient who was diagnose d as terminal over 50 years ago\".  \nIn addition, d octors who use the Gerson therapy are convinced that \nvegetables juices are powerful tools to achieve good health and recommend  \npatients to consume  raw foods (i.e., uncooked vegetables and fruits) every \nday to recover from illness.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n64 \n Finally, Mr. Handel  indicated  that if we helped them with the Spanish \ntranslation, they would be able to bring Dr. Gerson\u2019s life saving information to \nthe Spanish market a 12 t o 18 months sooner than expected. He stated: \n\"Imagine how many more lives we can save in that time.\"  \nNext, we will present the responses to a questionnaire, a real story of \nhow the therapy worked, and the case of a person who is looking for the \ninformation  of the movie in Spanish.   \n3.2.1. Questionnaire  \nFirstly, th is questionnaire  was completed  by Bill Handel,  who gladly \nand professionally replied the following  questions:  \n1)   Why do you consider necessary to translate the movie The \nBeautiful Truth into Sp anish?  \nWe at Gerson Media feel it is important and necessary to translate \n\u201cThe Beautiful Truth\u201d into Spanish for many reasons and I will list the first few  \nA.    Most of the people world -wide who became aware of the Gerson \nTherapy and who benefitted from i mplementing it in their life, found out about \nit first by viewing one of our movies in English,  The Beautiful Truth, The \nGerson Miracle or Dying to Have Known .  Having the Beautiful Truth \navailable in Spanish will provide knowledge of the life saving benef its of The \nGerson Therapy to the tens of millions of Spanish speaking people \nthroughout the world\u2026  \n\u00b7  Nine countries in South America, ( Ecuador, Venezuela,  Colombia, \nPer\u00fa, Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile, Argentina)   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n65 \n \u00b7  Six Countries in Central America, ( Guatemala, Honduras, El \nSalvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panam\u00e1)  \n\u00b7  Three Countries in the Caribbean, (Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican \nRepublic)  \n\u00b7  One Country in Africa, ( Equatorial Guinea)  \n\u00b7  The United States  \n\u00b7  Canada  \n\u00b7  Mexico  \n\u00b7  Spain  \nB.    It is widely  known that as the popularity of the Internet grows, \nreadership of traditional information sources such as magazines and \nnewspapers has diminished.  The Internet viewing of movies, documentaries, \ntraining videos, independent news, commentaries, etc has gro wn \nexponentially and evidence for this is found in the fact that YouTube is now \nthe second largest search engine in the world.  With Spanish version of The \nBeautiful Truth being available free  on the Internet,  Spanish speaking people \neverywhere will have i nstant access to the movie and the important life \nsaving information it provides.   Additionally, they will be able to share it with \nfamily, friends and loved ones.                                                     \nPlease note that the English versions of our movies are available on \nYouTube for FREE viewing and following is the  number of views for each \nmovie.              \nThe Beautiful Truth - 947,895  \nThe Gerson Miracle - 210,554   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n66 \n Dying to Have Known - 192,792     \nC.    While considering this answer, please ke ep in mind that this is a \nbroad generalization and there are exceptions to every rule . \nSpanish speaking people would benefit from seeing The Beautiful \nTruth because they become aware of Gerson Therapy, a low cost health care \nsystem they can do by themselve s, for themselves and does not require the \nmoney, time and resources necessary to participate in the traditional \n\u201cAllopathic\u201d treatment of cancer and chronic disease.  \n When compared to western nations, most Spanish speaking counties \nhave a much smaller \u201cIn dex of Economic Freedom\u201d which is one of the best \nindictors of economic opportunity and prosperity.   If people live in a country \nwith good economic prosperity, they generally have the ability to afford \nquality health care. If they live in a country with ec onomic repression, their \naccess and ability to afford health care is limited.    \n \nIt is an unfortunate reality that the majority of Spanish speaking people \nthroughout the world are at the lower end of the economic scale, making it \ndifficult, if not impossi ble sometimes, to afford quality health care. \n Although  Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica and Cuba are rated highest among  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n67 \n the Latin American nations \u2013 they are still only rated 22nd, 33rd, 36th and \n39th in the world, respectively. Having access to a Spanish ver sion of  The \nBeautiful Truth , which will in turn lead to people discovering The Gerson \nTherapy.   Knowing about the Gerson Therapy gives people access to the \nbest all natural solution for cancer and chronic disease available today.  \n2) Who will be the benefic iaries of this translation?  \nWith the cancer rate of the Hispanic community in the US now being 1 \nin 2 and the diabetes rate being 1 in 3, access to an all natural solution that \ncan be done inexpensively at home is a tremendous benefit. With the cancer \nand chronic disease rate on the rise throughout the world, all Spanish \nspeaking people everywhere would benefit.  \n3)   Why do you think the Spanish -speaking people should have \naccess to this information?  \nSee answers above in regard to the affordability and econ omic access \nto health care.  \n4)   What is the reason for which this movie has not been \ntranslated yet?         \nGerson Media simply has not had the budget or personnel to facilitate \nsuch a project.  \n5) How would the Spanish -speaking community learn about the \ntranslated movie?  \nGerson Media has purchased to a fantastic PR system that we would \nuse to send press releases to Spanish speaking journalists who write for \nmagazines, newspapers, newsletters, and Hispanic community papers.   We  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n68 \n would send these same announc ements to Spanish radio announcers and \nreporters at Spanish television stations. We will also make announcements \nvia our world -wide radio show \u201cThe Power of Natural Healing with Howard \nStraus\u201d, Spanish based email newsletters, Spanish language pages on our  \ncurrent English website and announcements placed in our wholesale catalog \nthat is mailed to 5000 organic food stores, health food stores, vitamin stores,  \nherb shops, books stores and more. We would also begin developing a \ndatabase of Spanish book stores, food markets, vitamin stores and more in \nwhich we would then mail a Spanish products catalog.  \nBill Handel  \nVice President of Sales & Marketing  \nGerson Health Media  \n(P) 530 -529-1100  \n(E) bill@gersonmedia.com  \nwww.gersonmedia.com  \n3.2.2. A Real Case about the Gerson Therapy  \nThere is a very particular case about the unbelievable story of Carla \nShuford, a bone cancer s urvivor. When she was 15 years old in 1958, Carla  \nwas diagnosed with osteogenic sarcoma, a common type of bone cancer in \nchildren that originates mainly in the bones of the legs. When di agnosed, the \ncancer had already metastasized to the lymph nodes. Even though doctors \ndecided for surgery, rather than r adiation, amputating  one of Carla's legs at \nthe hip, they told her that she would only have 6 months to live.  With this \nprognosis, Carla's mother did not give up hope and went looking for Dr. Max  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n69 \n Gerson at his New York clinic. Due to the extreme demands of  his therapy, \nDr. Gerson rarely allowed patients to follow the treatment at home. However, \nhe decided to trust Carla's mother, and this was how Carla was cared by her \ndevoted family receiving the strict Gerson therapy for five years. For juicing \nand meals,  they needed organic produce, which were obtained from their \nown farm and the farms of friends, who were happy to help with Carla's \ntreatment by dedicating parts of their gardens to pesticide -free crops. Despite \nthe death sentence given by her doctors in 1 958 when she was 15, Carla is \nstill alive. She must be turning 70 this year.  \nCarla remains on a strictly organic diet, and enjoys swimming \ndaily. She is an active member in her local organic community \nin Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Last year, she gave an interview \nfor a project documenting the Carrboro Farmers\u2019 Market for the \nSouthern Foodways Alliance, and spoke of her experience on \nthe Gerson diet, and how it has led to a lifelong passion for \norganic produce.  (The Gerson Institute, 2012 . Retrieved from \nhttp://gerson.org/gerpress/carla -shufor -osteogenic -sarcoma/ ).  \nThe story of Carla has helped many people to learn about the \nexistence of this therapy, s he has been the inspiration  for others to try out the \ndifferent and natural alternative. This is absolute ly remarkable  because there \nis hope, and  people need to be aware of this incredible way of being healthy.  \nA video with the interview that Carla gave to the Southern Foodways Alliance  \nin 2011 is available on http://gerson.org/gerpress/carla -shufor -osteogeni c-\nsarcoma/ . \n3.2.3. Phone -Call Interview  \nThe interviewee's name is Rossana Mendoza Ibarra (R), who lives in \nDallas, TX, USA. Rossana has lived there for about 10 years. She is  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n70 \n originally from Ecuador, so her mother tongue is Spanish. She was \ninterviewed by  us Yessenia Gallardo (Y) and Mar\u00eda Agustina Cede\u00f1o (M). \nThe interview was done in Spanish because Rossana does not know enough \nEnglish, but here we present it translated from Spanish to English for the \npurposes of this thesis.  \nM: Hello Rossana, we are two  students of the UCSG Translation \nprogram working on our graduation thesis, which consists of translating the \nmovie The Beautiful Truth  from English to Spanish, and we heard that you \nwere interested in seeing the movie. The purpose of this interview is to learn \nmore about this interest of you. Now, we will start with the questions:  \nM: How did you learn about this movie and why are you interested in \nseeing it?  \nR: Some of my colleagues at work were talking about a movie about \ncancer and other degenerative dis eases and how they could be cured with a \nnatural method very different from chemotherapy. Some people I know who \nhave cancer suffer a lot from this awful chemo. Besides, they said that this \ntherapy would also help people with blood pressure problems, obesi ty, \ndiabetes, and many other health issues, and because I personally have some \nhealth problems, I got very interested in it. Since then, I have been looking for \nthis information but it is available only in English, and my English is not good \nenough to unde rstand it totally.  \nY: How do you think this information would benefit you if it were \navailable in Spanish?   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n71 \n R: I think I will be able to have the choice to decide whether to go for \nthe therapy or to continue with the traditional medical treatment that I am \nunder nowadays. One good reason for learning about this natural therapy is \nthat I can be informed on time and prevent further health complications. Of \ncourse, my main goal would be to find the cure for all my health problems.  \nM: What kind of health problem s do you have?  \nR: My main problem is related to blood pressure and for that I need to \ntake traditional medicine daily to avoid the symptoms, but I am sick and tired \nof it. Besides, I have had some weight problems since I had my third child, \nand I have not been able to go back to my original weight. My co -workers \nsaid that if using this therapy, I could lose weight and recover my health in a \ngreat deal, and that is why I would really like to get all the information in my \nown language so I can learn more abou t it. \nY: Do you know anyone else who would also be interested in this \nmovie?  \nR: Yes my colleagues, the ones who were talking about the movie. \nThey said that someone else told them about it, and that they have also been \nlooking for this information in Spani sh, but they have not found it yet. My \nfamily and friends in Ecuador would like to learn more about it too.  \nM: With respect to the movie, do you know how dental mercury based \namalgams and a food flavor -enhancer known as Monosodium Glutamate can \nbe harmful to people's health?  \nR: Oh really! I know there are many people who have those dark \namalgam fillings on their teeth but I did not know that they were bad for your  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n72 \n health. If they are that bad, why do dentist keep using them? Do they know \nthat they are harmf ul? I myself have a couple of those fillings. One more \nreason to see the movie, then. With regard to the food flavor -enhancer I \nreally have no idea.  \nM: In the movie, they explain why the amalgam fillings and the \nMonosodium Glutamate are not safe for peopl e. Now, supposing that you \nhad a chronic disease and can choose between the traditional medicine with \npills, injections, etc., and a therapy based on fruits and vegetables with both \nmethods being equally successful, which one would you choose and why?  \nR: I would definitely go for the most natural way of treating any kind of \ndisease. I am really tired of too many pharmaceutical drugs. They may cure \nsome of your health problems, but on the other hand, they can also harm you \nbadly.  \nY: Thank you very much Rossa na for your time  and your useful \nanswers . We really hope that our contribution to the Gerson Institute with the \ntranslation of this movie help s you, your family, your friends and many others  \nin the near future.  \n \nName: Rossana Mendoza Ibarra  \nEmail: rossanam 71@yahoo.com  \nPhone: 682 -553-0671  \nAddress: Dallas, TX \u2013 USA \n \n3.3. Discussion  \nFirst of all, as we can see in the questionnaire  responses , Mr. Bill \nHandel clearly emphasized  how important the translation of the Movie The  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n73 \n Beautiful Truth  would  be for the Span ish-speaking community. He listed \nseveral reasons being the main one the life saving benefits that many \nEnglish -speaking people have already obtained by learning and using the \nnatural therapy that the Gerson Institute provides. He also stated that the \nMovi e The Beautiful Truth  is the most visited one among their movies on \nYouTube. Besides, Mr. Handel mentioned  that if the translation is done , the \nbenefit would  be as well for the tens of millions of Spanish -speaking people \naround the world, highlight ing in this way how large and how important this \ncommunity is in our society worldwide. B esides, as he said , since the \nmajority of this community does not have an easy access and ability to afford \nhealth care due to economic limitations, the translation of this mo vie would  \nbe very convenient for them as the access to this information will be free on \nthe Internet. It will be broadcast on YouTube, which is now the second \nlargest search engine in the world , according to Mr. Handel . Also, the \ninstitute will  run campaig ns promoting through television, radio, catalogs, the \ninternet, and direct mail, the availability of the new Gerson Media material in \nthe Spanish language.  This effort will guarantee that the Spanish version of \nthis movie reaches  the majority of the Spanis h-speaking  community . \nContinuing with this analysis, we can see how the information of the \nGerson therapy, which is available in this documentary movie, was very \nuseful and somehow saved Carla Shuford's life since she used this therapy \nto treat her bone ca ncer that she was diagnosed  with when she was only a \n15-year-old girl. This lady has become an inspiration for many people who \nlearned about her way of living healthy and well , thanks to the therapy.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n74 \n Last but not least, it is important to mention that the respondent \n(Rossana Mendoza Ibarra) of our interview above is not alone. There are \nmany other people in the US in a similar situation. Figure 2 illustrates how \nlarge the Spanish speaking community in the US is , according to the 2012 \nUS Census.  \nOver 100 lan guages are spoken in the US, but the 2012 US \nCensus reports that Spanish is the most common language \namong non -native English speakers. Communicating with the \nLatino market in Spanish is not a courtesy; it is a requirement! \nMuch of the Spanish speaking pop ulation in the US is not fluent \nin English. In fact, nearly 50% of this populace identifies itself \nas having limited English skills \u2014of 55 million Spanish \nspeakers, 25 million speak English less than \u201cvery well\u201d in their \nself-assessment.  (Watkins, 2013 . Ret rieved from  \nhttp://www.gala -global.org/blog/2013/a -growing -market -\nspanish -speakers -in-the-us/) \n \n \n \nFigure 2.  Non-English Speakers in the U nited States  \nSource:  http://www.gala -global.org/blog/wp -\ncontent/uploads/WatkinsChart.jpg  \n  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n75 \n Therefore, our decision  of translating this informative documentary \nmovie went even further than a regular graduation project. When Spanish -\nspeaking people start learning about the information included in the movie \nand they begin getting all the benefits from it, we will be able to see that our \nresearch w as done with a mission in mind, which is to make this important \ninformation available in Spanish so everyone who speaks that language can \nhave access to it, and that will be our contribution to society . \n \n \n \n  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n76 \n CHAPTER IV  \n4. CONCLUSIONS  AND RECOMMENDATIONS  \n4.1. CONCLUSIONS  \nAs a conclusion, it is important to mention that in the translation \nprocess, professional translators should be especially familiar with an \nadvanced level of mastery of a foreign language, in this case, English or \nSpan ish, whichever is considered to be the second language; furthermore, \nwith the cultural part of the intended audience. When analyzing translations \nin a scientific way, the annotation process is a very important tool for the \ntranslator to transmit his lingui stic knowledge of the field and rendering skills, \nas well as his experience applied during the process of translating any text \nfrom the source to the target language, since it identifies any potential \ntranslation problems and at the same time it offers som e possible solutions \nwith their corresponding explanations.  Moreover, translators must be \ninformed and interested in all the information intended to be translated \nincluding some backgrounds, in our case, we are immersed in these \nnutritional issues to give an accurate and reliable message from the \ninformation we have gathered during the research process.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n77 \n 4.2. RECOMMENDATIONS  \nIn our research project we have conducted the translation from \nEnglish to Spanish of a documentary movie script, in which have bee n \napplied different translation techniques and methods that have helped us to \nanalyze each of the diverse problems that the rendering of it encountered. \nBesides, it has been a great experience for us to investigate about the most \nrenowned  experts in Lingu istics, whose theories have been followed in the \nmajority of this research. We recommend everyone to read our research \npaper and  in that way get involved in how a translation could be an important \ntool and means to transmit a message from one language to a nother, and \nhow the result of it can make a difference in people's lives. Our \nrecommendation to the Gerson Institute for the near future will be to carry out \nthe dubbing of the movie  so that will be a good alternative apart from the \ntranslation which will also benefit the Spanish -speaking community.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n78 \n GLOSSARY  \nNOTE: The concepts for all the following terms were taken from Biology \nOnline (www.biology -online.org/dictionary/), except for the ones whose \nsources are cited.  \nAmalgams  \n(Science: dentistry) a soft metal which results from an alloy of a metal with \nmercury.

you're not allowed to heal.  \n01:04:23:01  There's too much money to be made on drugs.  \n01:04:25:14  STEVE KROSCHEL: For Garrett's diabetic neighbor, John, \nthis message came too late to save his legs.  \n01:04:30:20  But perhaps Bob the milkman has the best observation about \nthe Gerson therapy.  \n01:04:35:27  BOB: What I'd like to see is some proof, some good scientific \nproof.  \n01:04:41:00  STEVE KROSCHEL: When a cruise ship came to town, many \nvisitors would come to learn about the wildlife that Garrett \ncared for.  \n01:04:46:14  He found it surprising how unfamiliar most people were about \nwild animals an d their requirements.  \n01:05:04:03  STEVE KROSCHEL: The news of this situation eventually \ngot back to Dr. Gerson's daughter, Charlotte, who sent Garrett \na little gift.  \n01:05:21:09  It was a new book written by Charlotte that spelled out how \nDr. Gerson's the rapy worked.  \n01:05:27:06  It has easy -to-understand statements about cancer.  \n01:05:30:17  Even a 15 -year-old could find the text a good read.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n93 \n 01:05:34:12  The chapters were profound and seemed too good to be true.  \n01:05:38:02  Points were made that sparked  curiosity to learn more.  \n01:05:47:26  STEVE KROSCHEL: This moment was about to become a \nnew chapter in Garrett's life.  \n01:05:51:25  Up to this time, reading a book cover to cover was a rarity for \nhim. \n01:05:55:26  But in this instance it was different, du e partly in what the \nbook addressed, it was what he observed day to day even when \ndoing the most mundane chores.  \n01:06:05:23  What Garrett had not fully realized was the implications of the \npotency and power contained in vegetation.  \n01:06:29:29  STEVE KROS CHEL: What seemed like a simple snack taken \nfor granted in the garden had tremendous implications \nworldwide.  \n01:06:36:03  If Gerson's therapy was accepted and implemented, it would \nhelp change the history of mankind's modern agriculture, food \nsupply, healt h care systems, economy, and of course, the \nenvironment.  \n01:06:48:21  Then Garrett learned a lesson in being misunderstood one day \nwhen his father cleaned the house and tossed an art work piece \nthat Garrett had made into the trash.  \n01:06:56:28  Because of its unusual design, the community garbage \ncollector fished it out and gave it to local police, who declared \nit a bomb, definitely a blow to Garrett's creativity.  \n01:07:05:21  Other situations then took their toll on the boy, and Garrett's \nstraight -A record  sunk.  \n01:07:11:07  His father decided he needed to be home schooled.  \n01:07:13:23  His first home schooled lesson was about Dr. Gerson and...  \n01:07:17:10  BOB: I'd like to see some scientific proof.  \n01:07:20:13  STEVE KROSCHEL: The boy wasn't sure how that  would be \naccomplished, but he did draw out an analogy between gold \nmining and human nature, to start with.  \n01:07:32:04  He decided the best place to start his research would be the \npublic library.  \n01:07:36:15  It didn't take much time before he located se veral independent \nsources that confirmed important points, as outlined in Dr. \nGerson's original classic book.  \n01:07:46:11  From those important leads, the dubious characters that make \nup the history of the use of fluoride fascinated the boy.  \n01:07:53:21  He dug for more information, and then more skeletons were \nuncovered.  \n01:07:58:08  Then Garrett began to assemble a general outline of what \nneeded to be accomplished to successfully confirm the Gerson \nProtocol.  \n01:08:06:07  It was when the words about hope w ere written that I made an \ninquiry to become involved in helping him document the \nintegrity of the Gerson Therapy.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n94 \n 01:08:15:22  GARRETT: First there's Gerald Cox, who worked for the \nMellon Institute of Industrial Research.  \n01:08:20:23  The Mellon Institute , by the way, was the leading defender for \nthe asbestos industry.  \n01:08:25:26  Gerald Cox became interested in the fluoride from the \nsuggestions of Francis Frary, the director of the aluminum \nlaboratory of Alcoa.  \n01:08:35:02  And then came a leading scient ist in toxicology, Dr. Harold \nHodge.  \n01:08:39:22  Harold Hodge was the one who oversaw injecting plutonium \nand uranium in people.  \n01:08:45:29  STEVE KROSCHEL: Harold Hodge studied the questionable \nsafety of fluoride, but under the combined pressures of the  \nAtomic Commission and aluminum manufacturing, he had to \nsay it was safe.  \n01:08:55:12  GARRETT: Harold Hodge, along with a group of scientists, \nhelped develop the atom bomb.  \n01:08:59:25  Then there was Dr. Robert Kehoe, who worked for the \nKettering Laborat ory. \n01:09:04:24  Back in the '50s, Mr. Kehoe was industrial evangelist for the \nEthyl Corporation, promoting the safety of lead in gasoline at \nthe time.  \n01:09:14:20  Frank L. Seamans was the attorney of Alcoa and the head of \nthe Fluorine Lawyers Committee.  \n01:09:21:02  And then there was a beagle dog study, in which these dogs \nhad to breathe fluoridated air six days a week.  \n01:09:27:08  Well, the dogs sustained stupendous damage to their lungs and \nlymph system.  \n01:09:32:04  This information should have been  given to doctors and \nscientists, but instead was given to the Fluorine Lawyer's \nCommittee, and was buried.  \n01:09:39:29  And then came Edward Bernays, the nephew of Sigmund \nFreud, the wizard of public relations.  \n01:09:45:04  STEVE KROSCHEL: Selling fluorid e for public water \nsupplies was easy for Bernays.  \n01:09:48:21  He used the slogan \"Trust your Doctor.\"  \n01:09:51:06  To this day, even fluoride tablets are dispensed to children, \nthanks in part for the need  to use fluoride to build the atom \nbomb.  \n01:09:58:0 8  MAN ON TELEVISION: I am represent one mile on your \ncamera.  \n01:10:01:03  The top part, two miles.  \n01:10:02:15  We're going to switch to another camera.  \n01:10:04:02  I'm going to move out of here.  \n01:10:05:18  MALE VOICE: Three, two, one, zero.  \n01:10:13:0 0  The shock wave will arrive in the control point area in \napproximately half a minute.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n95 \n 01:10:47:09  STEVE KROSCHEL: In declassified government documents, \nthe Atomic Commission stated of its use of fluoride and \nquestionable safety record in building the bo mb that \n\"information which would invite or tend to encourage claims \nagainst the Atomic Commission or its contractors, such \nportions of articles to be published should be reworded or \ndeleted.  \n01:11:08:21  Parallels can be drawn from this history to another in the \nmaking about... cell phones?  \n01:11:13:27  A $28 million grant was given to Dr. George Carlos in the '90s \nto prove  cell phone safety, but instead he found otherwise.  \n01:11:22:02  He refused to be paid off.  \n01:11:24:05  Cell phone transmissions are st ill a concern as to how they \naffect insects.  \n01:11:29:17  GARRETT: Do they teach this in public schools?  \n01:11:33:02  STEVE KROSCHEL: But when it comes to dental health, diet, \nnot fluoride can play a huge role.  \n01:11:38:03  This became vivid for Garrett as  he assisted on minor surgery \nof his tame wolf.  \n01:11:43:12  The perfect, cavity -free teeth of the wolf pointed to facts in a \nbook he had just finished studying from the library.  \n01:11:52:06  It was called Nutrition and Physical Degeneration , by a \ndistingu ished dentist named Dr. Weston Price.  \n01:12:02:21  Dr. Price traveled the world with his wife in the 1930's to visit \nNative cultures that had never been exposed to modern \ncivilization's diet of white flour, canned food and sugar.  \n01:12:13:07  To his amazem ent, these people averaged less than 1% of tooth \ndecay.  \n01:12:17:16  And Dr. Price noted something else.  \n01:12:20:05  None of the people in these different tribes and cultures \npracticed any sort of dental hygiene.  \n01:12:24:18  Not one of his subjects had e ver used a toothbrush.  \n01:12:28:11  But once processed food was introduced to them, tooth decay \nand disease followed, and it was the beginning of the end of \nthe uniformly hardy and strong.  \n01:12:41:18  STEVE KROSCHEL: Dr. Price studied animals with imprope r \ndiets.  \n01:12:44:12  Two-headed calves, deformed cats were the result.  \n01:12:47:26  He also observed a direct link between human skull formation \nand diet.  \n01:12:58:28  STEVE KROSCHEL: And yet in present day, the subject of \nfluoride is still debated.  \n01:13 :03:10  In the state capital of Juneau, Alaska, I met up with the city's \nChief Dental Officer.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n96 \n 01:13:09:23  CHIEF DENTAL OFFICER: Um, for the State of Alaska's \nposition on water fluoridation, the Department of Health and \nSocial Services and the Division of  Public Health support \nwater fluoridation.  \n01:13:17:24  But in Alaska it is a local initiative, and what's going on in \nJuneau is a local vote on Juneau resuming water fluoridation.  \n01:13:24:09  So, while the Department supports this, this is really a - a local \nissue, and I'm also involved with the Citizens for Dental \nHealth, um, Coalition, but that's not in my capacity as State \nDental Officer.  \n01:13:36:05  STEVE KROSCHEL: Do you think that fluoride in the water \nwill help prevent cavities and such?  \n01:13:40: 24  What's your position?  \n01:13:41:22  CHIEF DENTAL OFFICER: I think there's clear evidence \nover the past 60 some years now that fluoride reduces tooth \ndecay.  \n01:13:47:06  STEVE KROSCHEL: But fluoride's only measurable effects \non dental decay are from topi cal application not from drinking \nit. \n01:13:53:05  Garrett needed to see both sides of medicine.  \n01:13:56:02  He then viewed compelling scenes from stock footage about \nGerson I had already compiled.  \n01:14:00:14  DR. DEAN EDELL: If you think of basically wh at's in \nGerson's therapy, you wouldn't really expect it to cure cancer.  \n01:14:06:04  So no, I don't think there's any evidence that anybody's ever \nbeen cured by Gerson therapy.  \n01:14:11:12  DR. WALLACE SAMPSON: It's not right from any aspect at \nall. \n01:14: 14:16  STEVE KROSCHEL: Well, has the Gerson therapy ever cured \na cancer patient?  \n01:14:18:02  DR. WALLACE SAMPSON: Of course not.  \n01:14:18:18  They won't even release their records.  \n01:14:20:09  DR. STEPHEN BARRETT: There's absolutely no scientific \nevidenc e that he's cured anyone.  \n01:14:25:00  I've never interviewed any Gerson patients.  \n01:14:28:07  It really is pointless.  \n01:14:29:21  STEVE KROSCHEL: But I had interviewed patients, and \nmore than a couple.  \n01:14:32:16  These patients had recovered from ever y type of cancer.  \n01:14:35:21  And, for many of them, it was terminal.  \n01:14:37:18  Orthodox medicine had given up on them and sent them all \nhome to die.  \n01:14:41:18  Some of them published books about their recoveries.  \n01:14:44:04  I traveled all over the  world, from Holland to Japan, and \neverywhere it was the same result: recovery.  \n01:14:59:00  STEVE KROSCHEL: And even heart arteries can be restored.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n97 \n 01:15:08:07  STEVE KROSCHEL: When Prince Charles spoke publicly in \nfavor of the Gerson therapy after obser ving its effectiveness, \nhe was skewered by the medical community.  \n01:15:18:12  Nevertheless, I had observed his unwavering sentiments in a \nletter that was sent to the Gerson Institute.  \n01:15:28:15  STEVE KROSCHEL: Charlotte Gerson routinely gives \nlectures about her father's famous therapy all over the world.  \n01:15:34:07  CHARLOTTE GERSON: Dr. Gerson said, \"Two basic things \nare toxicity and deficiency.\"  \n01:15:40:27  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett was on the right track with his \nhome school schedule, and what he had  just seen drew him in \neven deeper.  \n01:15:47:25  Now the world began to appear slightly more complicated to \nhim. \n01:15:52:01  As he studied various magazine articles about the increasing \nincidents of cancer, he searched curiously and exhaustively for \nany m ention of Dr. Gerson's therapy within mainstream media \nsources.  \n01:16:14:19  STEVE KROSCHEL: Instead, what he discovered within the \npages of any given article about cancer or chronic disease was \na different approach to the crisis, one that made him \nsuspici ous. \n01:16:26:21  Garrett wanted to learn more, and to his delight, the Gerson \nfamily sent him some long -forgotten film reels.  \n01:16:32:25  Dr. Gerson's image with his family came to life.  \n01:16:44:04  STEVE KROSCHEL: There was the discovery of footage of \nCharlotte Gerson in her twenties that captured his imagination \nwithin the historical reference of the where, why, and how this \nfamily eventually ended up in the United States from \nGermany.  \n01:17:11:21  STEVE KROSCHEL: As a young doctor in Germany, Max \nGers on's inspiration was Hungarian medical researcher, Dr. \nIgnaz Semmelweis, who discovered that if physicians simply \nwashed their hands between delivering babies, women would \nno longer die of infections.  \n01:17:26:25  STEVE KROSCHEL: He was severely ridiculed for the \nsuggestion.  \n01:17:29:23  Ridicule followed Gerson as well, after he discovered a cure \nfor his migraine headaches and then tuberculosis, by changing \nthe diet.  \n01:17:37:13  A clinical trial was undertaken with 450 incurable skin \ntuberculosis patients . \n01:17:43:14  None of them recovered at first, and Gerson was devastated.  \n01:17:47:00  But then it was discovered that a nurse was sneaking pastries, \nbeer and sausages to the patients.  \n01:17:53:23  The Gerson diet was then strictly followed, leading to th e \nrecovery of 446 of the 450 patients.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n98 \n 01:18:03:12  Then he discovered it cured cancer.  \n01:18:08:09  STEVE KROSCHEL: In World War II, Gerson was able to \nflee Nazi persecution with his family to the United States.  \n01:18:14:21  He continued to not only cure cancer, but other chronic \ndiseases, too.  \n01:18:18:14  And when his close friend, Dr. Albert Schweitzer suffered \nfrom diabetes, he cured Dr. Schweitzer as well, leading \nSchweitzer to assess and declare that Gerson was, quote, \"The \nmost imminent genius in me dical history.\"  \n01:18:29:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: In July of 1946, Senator Claude Pepper \nheld Senate subcommittee hearings over Dr. Gerson's cancer \ntherapy.  \n01:18:37:21  The astounding testimony was quickly reported by ABC News \ncommentator, Raymond Graham Swing , over ABC radio.  \n01:18:45:04  The public's reaction was swift and favorable.  \n01:18:47:19  But the broadcast resulted in the firing of Raymond Graham \nSwing two weeks later, due to severe pressure by the \nPharmaceutical and American Medical Establishment.  \n01:18:57:13  VOICE OF DR. MAX GERSON: I was investigated five \ntimes.  \n01:19:01:12  VOICE OF REPORTER: What do you mean by being \ninvestigated?  \n01:19:03:03  VOICE OF DR. MAX GERSON: From the M.E.  \n01:19:04:12  VOICE OF REPORTER: They investigated you?  \n01:19:05:1 3  VOICE OF DR. MAX GERSON: Yes. Five times.  \n01:19:07:19  Every time they come, I showed them the patients you sent \nhome to die, cured.  \n01:19:15:03  All the patients you sent home to die, cured.  \n01:19:19:07  Next patient you sent home to die, cured.  \n01:19: 23:07  STEVE KROSCHEL: And cure he did, including people with \nmuscular dystrophy, like this young girl.  \n01:19:31:05  STEVE KROSCHEL: Dr. Gerson's public lectures about his \ntherapy were unpopular amongst his peers.  \n01:19:36:10  For example, Gerson had spoke n out against tobacco since \n1920.  \n01:19:40:24  MALE TELEVISION ANNOUNCER: Time out for many \nmen of medicine usually means just long enough to enjoy a \ncigarette.  \n01:19:46:11  And because they know what a pleasure it is to smoke a mild, \ngood -tasting cigarett e, they're particular about the brand they \nchoose.  \n01:19:54:25  In a repeated national survey, doctors in all branches of \nmedicine, doctors in all parts of the country were asked, \"What \ncigarette do you smoke, doctor?\"  \n01:20:05:10  Once again, the brand na med most was Camel.  \n01:20:08:21  Yes, according to this repeated nation -wide survey, more \ndoctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n99 \n 01:20:16:04  Why not change to Camels for the next 30 days and see what a \ndifference it makes in your smoking enjoyment . \n01:20:23:04  See how Camels agree with your throat.  \n01:20:25:23  See how mild and good -tasting a cigarette can be.  \n01:20:29:26  STEVE KROSCHEL: And as more layers of the therapy were \nuncovered and understood, it was becoming clear to Garrett \nwhy there wa s such opposition to Gerson's therapy of caring \nfor health, as opposed to the existing, quote, \"Health Care.\"  \n01:20:41:04  Perhaps other priorities were in play here.  \n01:20:43:27  The boy remembered the superior effectiveness in a remedy \nhis father had use d on his foot.  \n01:20:48:24  Costly and toxic pharmaceuticals had not worked.  \n01:20:52:06  But by merely dicing a few cloves of garlic mixed with raw \nhoney, his foot problem disappeared.  \n01:21:01:04  Raw honey also disinfected and greatly sped up cuts and \nabrasions.  \n01:21:07:23  STEVE KROSCHEL: Another healthy, inexpensive item used \nthat is non -toxic was hydrogen peroxide.  \n01:21:13:18  It was used as a cleanser in the home, and was even found \nuseful cosmetically in hair highlighting.  \n01:21:19:14  Garrett fou nd putting 3% hydrogen peroxide in the ears for a \ntime would even prevent the common cold.  \n01:21:28:28  STEVE KROSCHEL: There are volumes written about natural \ncures and treatments.  \n01:21:32:26  Knowledge is power.  \n01:21:35:14  Garrett gave his orphaned moo se calf, named Frannie, her last \nbottle of goat's milk.  \n01:21:43:05  And so, Garrett's home school lesson went to a new level.  \n01:21:46:22  It was time for him to take his home work on the road, and put \nit all to the ultimate test.  \n01:22:03:23  STEVE KROSC HEL: The entire foundation for Garrett's study \nand scientific analysis of Gerson's treatment commenced \naround breakfast with Charlotte Gerson in San Diego.  \n01:22:12:19  Charlotte Gerson's son, Howard Strauss, and a distinguished \nguest who had just arrived from Slovenia, also would join us.  \n01:22:19:24  It was here that Garrett would compare his notes about Dr. \nGerson's claims with unrelated outside sources to truly see if \nthey match up.  \n01:22:29:24  HOWARD STRAUS: Dental amalgam, and its - by the way, \ndenti sts like to call it \"alloy\" because it makes it sound so \nmuch more stable.  \n01:22:37:00  But dental amalgam is the biggest and the worst exposure to \nmercury that most Americans have in their lives.  \n01:22:45:01  STEVE KROSCHEL: If that is true, then millions  of people \nhave needlessly suffered a plethora of ills for well over a \ncentury, and didn't realize the true cause was all in their heads.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n100 \n 01:22:55:17  I was about to film a demonstration that proved this beyond a \nshadow of a doubt.  \n01:23:01:03  Dr. Roger E ichman and Dr. David Kennedy set up a \nphosphorescent screen and light that would be sensitive to \nmercury vapor coming off the tooth if it was present after even \nthe slightest  stimulation.  \n01:23:13:24  We had teeth with amalgam fillings that would be placed  in \nwater of just room temperature, to represent saliva in the \nmouth.  \n01:23:20:26  I did not truly believe mercury vapor would come off the tooth, \nor if it did, that the film camera would register it.  \n01:23:27:01  I also had a video camera on hand to recor d this event.  \n01:23:36:22  STEVE KROSCHEL: To my shock and horror, and, as you \ncan see, the 35 mm motion picture camera did register the \nmercury vapor coming off the tooth.  \n01:23:50:11  This is the first time in history this has ever been captured on a \nfilm camera.  \n01:24:01:29  STEVE KROSCHEL: To make certain that what you are \nseeing is mercury, we had on hand a special instrument called \na Jerome Mercury Sniffer to measure the levels.  \n01:24:12:14  DR. DAVID KENNEDY: 191.  \n01:24:14:00  STEVE KROSCHEL: 190. Sh ow that to me, please.  \n01:24:16:17  191. Is that high?  \n01:24:18:20  DR. DAVID KENNEDY: Uh, they'll close the factory if it gets \nover 100 and evacuate.  \n01:24:22:02  STEVE KROSCHEL: Oh boy. My gosh. Okay.  \n01:24:25:09  DR. ROGER EICHMAN: Now, you think about this-- \n01:24:26:11  STEVE KROSCHEL: Turn off the light.  \n01:24:27:17  DR. ROGER EICHMAN: This is room temperature, one tooth, \nat least 50 years old.  \n01:24:32:24  It's been - been de -gassing for years, and, um, many people \nhave a whole mouth full of them.  \n01:24:41:12  STEVE KROSCHEL: Yeah.  \n01:24:41:26  DR. ROGER EICHMAN: Now, just think what happens if you \nhave half a dozen people in a, uh, elevator all de -gassing like \nthis, uh, and is degassing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  \n01:24:55:00  STEVE KROSCHEL: Yeah . \n01:24:55:13  DR. ROGER EICHMAN: And your OSHA standards are \nbased on a 40 -hour week.  \n01:24:59:25  STEVE KROSCHEL: Next, Dr. Kennedy set up on the counter \nan amalgam mixer, which Dentists use in their office to mix \nthe amalgam capsules, which after mixing , are broke open to \nprepare to be placed inside a patient's mouth as the amalgam \nfilling.  \n01:25:16:12  The amalgam capsules are then lined up one by one on a \nshaker where they are shaken for a time.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n101 \n 01:25:23:16  With an unsuspecting patient nearby, the cap sules are then \nbroke open, just as any dentist or dental assistant will do.  \n01:25:30:13  Will mercury vapor be released?  \n01:25:32:12  At this point, I was pretty sure what the answer would be.  \n01:25:36:06  Remember, this is common procedure and goes on eac h and \nevery day all over the world in dental offices next to innocent \npatients.  \n01:25:55:28  STEVE KROSCHEL: The images speak for themselves.  \n01:25:58:02  For the American Dental Association to continue to insist that \namalgams are safe would seem absurd.  \n01:26:05:13  STEVE KROSCHEL: Turn on the light. Can we see what we \ngot? \n01:26:09:11  DR. DAVID KENNEDY: 252.  \n01:26:10:16  STEVE KROSCHEL: Yikes!  \n01:26:11:05  Should we exit this?  \n01:26:12:05  Are we getting poison in here?  \n01:26:13:28  DR. DAVID KENNEDY: Ye s, it's raised the room up.  \n01:26:15:23  STEVE KROSCHEL: Yeah.  \n01:26:16:29  DR. DAVID KENNEDY: Uh, it's no worse than working in a \ndental office.  \n01:26:19:20  DR. DAVID KENNEDY: I think it's a crime what they're \ndoing to their dental staff, is that the fem ale is much more \nsensitive, reproductive -wise, to mercury, and as a result causes \nnot only causes infertility, but it causes birth defects.  \n01:26:32:12  Of course, you get the usual denials, but when you look at the \nscientific literature, it is full of stu dies showing that exposure \nto mercury - either from your teeth or working in a dental \noffice will...  \n01:26:44:03  You know, you saw the demonstration.  \n01:26:45:21  There's huge  amounts of mercury in those offices.  \n01:26:47:14  They don't monitor that, they  don't warn the employees, they \ndon't give them adequate mask and protection.  \n01:26:54:24  And as a result, there's a tremendous amount of infertility in \ndental assistants.  \n01:26:58:14  There's a documentary on it.  \n01:26:59:24  It's about the Norwegian den tal nurses, and about their lives \nbeing devastated by their job when they were young girls.  \n01:27:06:15  So, I think it's a crime what they're doing to these young girls.  \n01:27:10:01  DR. ROGER EICHMAN: I've had patients come in, uh, from \nother dentists sa ying, \"Gee, all I had was my teeth cleaned, and \nI feel lousy for days after that, every time. How come?\"  \n01:27:20:16  Well, they polish the teeth, they get a huge  amount of mercury \nbeing released for several days after that, until you get a little \nbit of c orrosion over the top, which slows it down a little bit.  \n01:27:34:01  Um, but the amount of mercury released is just phenomenal.  \n01:27:39:00  And if they're sensitive to it, it'll put them over the edge.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n102 \n 01:27:42:12  When I was in dental school, I was told  that dentists were \naveraging their first heart attack by age 44.  \n01:27:50:02  Our life expectancy was age 52.  \n01:27:53:25  I personally related that to their use of mercury and amalgam \nfillings, because it wasn't occurring in orthodontics and in, uh, \nin surgeons.  \n01:28:05:15  STEVE KROSCHEL: I had made certain that Garrett was \nnowhere near this demonstration, to ensure he did not inhale \nany mercury vapor.  \n01:28:12:03  Yet that seemed absurd when considering that many people are \nwalking around with amalgams  in their mouths.  \n01:28:18:05  Dr. Gerson was right all along.  \n01:28:20:13  Dental health is paramount to healing from chronic disease.  \n01:28:27:08  STEVE KROSCHEL: In Colorado Springs, Colorado, there is \none renowned dentist who has spoken out about fluor ide, \ndental amalgams, and even the dangers of root canals for \ndecades.  \n01:28:37:09  His name is Dr. Hal Huggins.  \n01:28:40:02  But just before we were about to meet him, Garrett fell into a \ndepression.  \n01:28:44:22  He couldn't seem to overcome the disturbin g chemistry lesson \nabout deadly methyl mercury vapor that Dr. Roger Eichman \ngave.  \n01:28:52:11  This home school lesson had hit him hard.  \n01:28:57:03  And then the cause of his sadness was revealed.  \n01:29:00:03  The boy's parents had unwittingly allowed som e dentist to \nstick the mercury inside his mouth, too.  \n01:29:05:02  He now saw himself as a biohazard.  \n01:29:07:17  But the good news was that he was about to meet Dr. Hal \nHuggins, who would give him some reassuring direction.  \n01:29:13:07  DR. HAL HUGGINS: Well, most of the people I see who are \nhaving their amalgams removed have some sort of a dread \ndisease.  \n01:29:19:24  But you're interested in prevention?  \n01:29:22:01  Then you are one in 100 who's in a very good position, \nbecause prevention is a whole lot easier than correcting a \nproblem after it's occurred.  \n01:29:31:11  STEVE KROSCHEL: He asked how many dentists state that \nmercury fillings are safe.  \n01:29:34:17  DR. HAL HUGGINS: Well that would be pretty close to 100% \nif they want to be in dentistry tomorr ow. \n01:29:38:28  Because the dental association has certain rules and regulations \nthat if a dentist is asked, \"Is mercury toxic?\" and they say \nanything affirmative - they say, \"Well, yes it is; it's the most \npoisonous metal on the planet that's not - not radioactive\" - uh, \nthey're gonna lose their license and be selling used cars the \nnext day.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n103 \n 01:29:59:07  So, what they believe and what they can say, two different \nthings.  \n01:30:03:11  STEVE KROSCHEL: Then he wanted to know which dentists \nknow how to remove fillings properly.  \n01:30:06:27  DR. HAL HUGGINS: Those people who go out and just have \ntheir fillings removed at random, uh, by actual measurement, \n63% end up with an autoimmune disease within six months \nthat they did not have before they had their amalgam s \nremoved.  \n01:30:21:24  Something that very few people know - I just found out \nrecently - is that dentists have malpractice insurance.  \n01:30:29:04  Yes, okay, that's fine.  \n01:30:31:09  But, when a dentist takes mercury and the powder of copper \nand tin and zinc and silver, mixes it together, he is now a \nmanufacturer, and dentists do not have manufacturer's product \nliability insurance.  \n01:30:46:23  So, the hit is gonna fall on them where they are not insured.  \n01:30:50:11  That they are putting a poisonous sub stance into people's \nmouths and they have no protection from it.  \n01:30:57:24  So, the legal profession is going to tear them apart, as I see it.  \n01:31:03:22  Uh, if we look 5, 10 years down the line, the only people who \ncan take out your amalgams are gonna  be the lawyers.  \n01:31:09:20  STEVE KROSCHEL: Dr. Huggins guided Garrett to a dentist \nthat did know how to safely remove his filling.  \n01:31:14:13  The boy remembered a question he had asked Dr. Huggins \nabout retaliation for speaking out.  \n01:31:20:07  DR. H AL HUGGINS: Yes, there have been a number of cases \nof retaliation.  \n01:31:23:16  The first thing that they did was put up an enormous amount of \nmoney to see to it my license was removed for refusing to \nplace amalgam, for refusing to do root canals on patien ts, and \nwriting a book they didn't like.  \n01:31:37:24  There have been personal things that have been done against \nme and my family, which destroyed the family.  \n01:31:44:11  The rest of it destroyed the business.  \n01:31:46:21  They've destroyed everything I had except the mortgage on my \nhome, and for some reason or another, they did not want that.  \n01:31:56:13  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett reasoned that life could have \nbeen so much easier for him if he had just kept quiet, like most \ndoctors do.  \n01:32:02:17  So, the  question became...  \n01:32:04:14  GARRETT: Why put yourself through this?  \n01:32:08:16  DR. HAL HUGGINS: When you have seen the people that I \nhave seen, and you see that their life just has a few minutes, a \nfew hours before it runs out, and you see that that  can be \nturned around, and you see that years later these people do \nhave a life, that's the payment that I get.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n104 \n 01:32:26:03  That's why I keep doing what I'm doing.  \n01:32:29:04  STEVE KROSCHEL: It was a refreshing ideological position \nthat reminded Garrett  of Dr. Gerson.  \n01:32:33:18  But it's still as David and Goliath.  \n01:32:36:02  In this situation, the American Dental Association wields \ntremendous power and control over a dentist's life, and the \ndentist that performed the procedure of proper filling remo val \non Garrett was terrified of his identity being captured for this \nmovie.  \n01:32:49:29  Documents had to be signed, which meant that I was \npersonally liable to him for the ruining of his career and \nincome if I did film his face.  \n01:33:02:14  STEVE KROSCHE L: Hearings on mercury fillings are now \ntaking place in Washington D.C. that hopefully will put an end \nto this amalgam disaster.  \n01:33:10:00  It is estimated that there is 1000 tons of mercury in the fillings \nof Americans at the moment.  \n01:33:15:19  Incred ibly, the FDA has never conducted an environmental \nassessment of the use of dental mercury amalgam, as \nprescribed by law.  \n01:33:24:29  CHARLOTTE GERSON: It is very important for the orthodox \npeople to keep, uh, patients from coming to, uh, alternative \ntreatments, because they work.  \n01:33:34:12  People have been so brainwashed for so long.  \n01:33:37:17  STEVE KROSCHEL: But what could possibly be worse than \ndental health?  \n01:33:40:15  Certainly, food additives couldn't be that bad. \n01:33:43:12  HOWARD STRAUS: MSG is - is a tremendously damaging \nchemical.  \n01:33:48:22  Uh, Monosodium Glutamate is actually - it turns off the switch \nin your brain that says, \"I've had enough to eat.\"  \n01:33:56:21  The problem with MSG, though, it's an excitotoxin.  \n01:34:00:19  STEVE KROSCHEL: And just what is an excitotoxin?  \n01:34:03:06  There are thousands of studies and enough papers on the \nsubject to fill a small library.  \n01:34:07:16  The evidence has accumulated, and then accumulated some \nmore.  \n01:34:11:26  It's there for anyone t o read.  \n01:34:13:23  But the processed food industry is hoping the media and the \naverage person is too busy, lazy or unsophisticated enough to \nbe able to understand the subtleties of the science being \ndiscussed.  \n01:34:29:09  STEVE KROSCHEL: But just in cas e the average lay person \ndoes show a bit of curiosity about the dangers of flavor \nenhancers like MSG, the food industry has smartly printed \nlittle rack cards and brochures to give us, defending their crisp \nposition.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n105 \n 01:34:44:05  Garrett met with food exper ts, Jack and Adrienne Samuels, of \nTruth in Labeling . \n01:34:49:19  JACK SAMUELS: The subject of glutamic acid is very, very \ncomplex.  \n01:34:55:00  And consequently, many games can be played to try to \nconvince people that it is safe.  \n01:35:03:17  They removed  monosodium glutamate from many of their \nproducts, and replaced monosodium glutamate with other \ningredients that gave the consumer no clue to the presences of \nthe reactive component of monosodium glutamate.  \n01:35:18:25  After being told by my physician - who experienced one of my \nreactions to MSG - that I would soon die from an MSG, uh, \nexposure if I didn't learn to avoid it, uh, Adrienne used her \nbackground in research and went to the library, spending some \n4,000 hours to read everything she could find abo ut MSG.  \n01:35:42:04  Uh, to her surprise, she found there were studies that indicated \nthat MSG was safe, but they were all sponsored by the \nglutamate industry or their agents, and were all flawed to the \npoint of being worthless.  \n01:35:58:23  And, at the sa me time, there were many other studies that \nclearly demonstrated that MSG was toxic and dangerous.  \n01:36:06:08  STEVE KROSCHEL: Jack and Adrienne Samuels have an \nextremely comprehensive snapshot of MSG research done \nsince research really began on this addi tive. \n01:36:14:24  Garrett still wanted to play the devil's advocate, and researched \nthe research, because now it was becoming clearer to him \nduring this home school lesson that each side of an issue has \nreasons they take a position.  \n01:36:26:21  The chall enge is to ascertain the driving force behind any \ngiven scientific study.  \n01:36:32:11  It is money or morals?  \n01:36:35:26  But what the boy discovered - like Jack and Adrienne Samuels \nfound - is that there is no person, institution or agency that has \nclaim ed that MSG is safe that does not have close ties to food \nand/or drug industries, or that has not been remunerated by \nthem.  \n01:36:54:22  STEVE KROSCHEL: Neuroscientist Dr. John Olney has \nstudied MSG for decades.  \n01:36:59:01  He rarely gives interviews beca use of the unwanted attention it \nincites.  \n01:37:04:04  DR. JOHN OLNEY: My background is in experimental \nneuropathology.  \n01:37:08:01  I, uh, conducted a study of monosodium glutamate and its \ntoxicity potential for infant animals.  \n01:37:20:23  And I found th at glutamate destroys nerve cells in the \ndeveloping infant animal's brains.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n106 \n 01:37:31:15  STEVE KROSCHEL: I could understand his shyness about \nappearing on camera, because he has played a key role in the \nincriminating evidence against the processed food ind ustry for \nseveral years.  \n01:37:40:27  His findings are shocking to people, especially to parents of \nyoung children.  \n01:37:46:12  But when traveling away from home, the question then \nbecomes for Garrett, \"What do you eat?\"  \n01:37:51:05  At his home in Alaska  or visiting the Gerson family, his diet \nwas virtually devoid of any processed food.  \n01:37:57:13  It takes a little extra work to seek out delicious organic \nproduce and/or restaurants.  \n01:38:05:16  STEVE KROSCHEL: Stop!  \n01:38:07:08  After all this, I didn' t think - it's too late.  \n01:38:11:17  The chemicals in this fast food were working their magic on \nthe boy.  \n01:38:15:11  He ate this meal - actually, two meals - like he was possessed.  \n01:38:19:02  To me, it was disappointing, but to force the issue would l ikely \nbackfire.  \n01:38:23:16  He was free to make his own decisions.  \n01:38:37:23  STEVE KROSCHEL: Three hours later, on a plane headed for \nJackson, Mississippi, the results were in.  \n01:38:51:14  STEVE KROSCHEL: In Jackson, Mississippi, the boy met up \nwith a n incredible family of photographers, the Blaylocks.  \n01:38:59:07  Dr. Russell Blaylock is a renowned board certified \nneurosurgeon and author of several books on cancer, \nexcitotoxins and health.  \n01:39:08:25  He is a leading voice in the effort to make the p ublic aware of \nthis health atrocity.  \n01:39:13:21  Perhaps \"atrocity\" is too strong of a word.  \n01:39:17:08  If what he says is true, it's hard to think of any other.  \n01:39:22:10  It is here where Garrett reoriented himself to a healthy snack.  \n01:39:26:15  But, unbeknownst to the lad, I had a little test planned.  \n01:39:29:27  DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: The mass consumption of this \nexcitotoxin substance in the food is interfering with people's \nability to think and remember and use language, so that our \nchildren no longer have the capacity that their parents had.  \n01:39:43:14  And I think this is getting compounded, because there are more \nand more foods with multiple forms of this excitotoxins: four, \nfive, six in a single food.  \n01:39:53:01  So, there are children - and small children in particular - are \nconsuming such large amounts, it interferes with the \ndevelopment of the brain, as well as destroying these \nconnections between the brain cells.  \n01:40:04:15  And that interferes with brain function.  \n01:40:06:10  And that 's what we're seeing nation -wide, and in fact, world -\nwide in the industrialized nations.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n107 \n 01:40:11:25  DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: The reason that the food \nmanufacturers are telling the public it is safe is because they're \nmaking a huge profit off of it.  \n01:40:18 :01  And it's hard to compete with their fellow manufacturers if \nthey don't use the MSG, because it's a powerful taste -\nenhancing effect.  \n01:40:26:15  Uh, so, they just tend to ignore all of this research, even though \nit's literally thousands of studies.  \n01:40:32:06  And the studies keep growing, proving beyond any doubt in \nthe reasonable mind that in fact this is harming people's brains.  \n01:40:39:23  It's producing gross obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, uh, \ninfantile diabetes, atherosclerosis; a great  number of diseases \nare now connected to what's happening with the MSG \nexposure.  \n01:40:52:14  STEVE KROSCHEL: Chips were delivered to the table that \nwere laden with MSG.  \n01:40:56:01  Had Garrett done his homework?  \n01:40:57:13  DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: One of the things that people \ndon't understand, this can be a silent, uh, toxicity.  \n01:41:02:09  That is, they don't even know it's occurring.  \n01:41:04:22  Uh, a lot of people tell me, \"Well, I don't react.  \n01:41:06:28  I don't have these symptoms of nausea and v omiting and \nheadaches.\"  \n01:41:10:11  Uh, well, a lot of people that are exposed to MSG will not have \nthese symptoms, but they get the same damage.  \n01:41:16:25  And this occurs over a very long period of time: decades.  \n01:41:20:16  So, brain cells are being  destroyed, and until they lose a \nnumber of brain cells, they're not even aware that they're under \nthis toxicity.  \n01:41:29:13  Uh, it's known in neurology that you have to lose about 90% of \nthe neurons in a particular area of the brain before you develop \nsymptoms.  \n01:41:38:01  So, you - by the time you develop these symptoms, like \ndementia or Parkinson's disease, etcetera, you've already lost \n90% of the neurons in that part of the brain, and that's what's \nvery important.  \n01:41:48:17  DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: A nother really new important \nfinding is that it's strongly connected to the growth of cancer.  \n01:41:54:16  And we know that glutamate, when it's increased in a person's \ndiet, makes their cancer grow very rapidly and becomes highly \ninvasive.  \n01:42:03:00  That means it spreads all over their body.  \n01:42:05:05  The problem is, no one's telling cancer patients they need to be \nvery cautious about taking in these food additives.  \n01:42:11:28  Because it makes their cancer grow much faster and become \nmore invasive, which means they're less likely to survive their \ncancer.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n108 \n 01:42:20:18  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett never did eat any of those chips.  \n01:42:22:27  He wants all the brain cells he has.  \n01:42:25:03  The number of food products that contain MSG, but don't \nactually label it as such, is now almost infinite.  \n01:42:31:10  The only way to avoid this is to buy organic products and \nwhole foods.  \n01:42:35:17  What the boy also discovered was that this was further \nconfirmation of Gerson's discoveries 80 years earlier.  \n01:42:4 1:25  In order to provide a balanced report on the subject of \nprocessed foods, the boy then flew from Jackson, Mississippi \nto Omaha, Nebraska, with the hopes of interviewing a \nConAgra Foods public relations representative.  \n01:42:55:03  After several phone calls and a faxed message, he thought \nthere was reason to be optimistic.  \n01:43:00:12  But he was wrong.  \n01:43:01:28  No one at this huge facility would speak.  \n01:43:05:04  It was confusing and disturbing to the boy temporarily.  \n01:43:13:18  STEVE KROSCHEL:  For me, this heavily -guarded facility \nand non -communicative position was supreme arrogance, \nespecially when considering that they are feeding us - or some \nof us - every day.  \n01:43:23:19  It reminded me of facilities in Alaska, such as the military's \nHAARP  project that raises questions about the weather, or my \nexperiences in trying to get interviews with oil companies that \nturned me down flat.  \n01:43:40:01  The Native people of the North and their concerns are low \npriority.  \n01:43:43:22  The boy tried to cont act ConAgra twice more, with no reply.  \n01:43:50:19  STEVE KROSCHEL: All was not lost, however.  \n01:43:52:14  We went to Omaha's Mayberry Park, where Garrett found \ngreat delight once more.  \n01:44:06:22  HOWARD STRAUS: We have to go back to Hippocrates.  \n01:44: 09:00  He said, first of all, \"Do no harm.\"  \n01:44:10:27  Well, every single drug does harm.  \n01:44:14:20  Then he also said, \"Let food be your medicine and medicine be \nyour food.\"  \n01:44:20:16  That's very important, because food will nourish you and heal \nyou. \n01:44:26:00  It's natural materials, which your body knows how to utilize.  \n01:44:29:24  Your body has evolved over millions of years to use, whereas \nthese huge, incredibly profitable companies all over the world \nare damaging, liver toxic, and cause dise ase. \n01:44:42:24  So, how can they really be considered a medicine if they're \ncausing disease?  \n01:44:47:18  STEVE KROSCHEL: If we couldn't speak to food \nmanufacturers, then maybe we could speak to a food Engineer.  \n01:44:54:00  Meet Carol Hoernlein.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n109 \n 01:44:5 5:13  We met her at the St. Louis, Missouri airport, and we're \ndriving her to a radio interview.  \n01:45:00:06  Along the drive, there was plenty of time for sight -seeing.  \n01:45:03:09  Garrett, in particular, now had time to digest a lot of \ninformation.  \n01:45:07:21  He overheard much of the conversation going on in the front \nseat about another food additive that made him remember.  \n01:45:13:26  DR. JOHN OLNEY: In 1974, I petitioned the commissioner of \nFDA about some evidence I had found pertaining to aspartame  \ncausing, uh, brain lesions.  \n01:45:27:22  STEVE KROSCHEL: But despite all warnings, the former \nhead of G.D. Searle, Donald Rumsfeld, forced it into the food \nmarket anyway.  \n01:45:34:01  As a highly -paid and highly -respected food engineer, Carol \nwas right in  line to work with this dangerous substance.  \n01:45:39:26  It wasn't long before she was riddled with tumors, from her \npituitary gland to her ovaries.  \n01:45:44:20  She ballooned in weight and continues to have health \nproblems.  \n01:45:47:25  Carol will never be the same again.  \n01:45:49:29  She no longer wants to work as a food engineer, because, \nquote, \"I can't work at a place where I'm knowingly poisoning \npeople.\"  \n01:45:58:13  CAROL HOERNLEIN: This story is actually worse than the \ntobacco story, because at le ast you can choose not to smoke.  \n01:46:04:15  Food, you have no choice.  \n01:46:07:21  STEVE KROSCHEL: We were now at the radio station where \nCarol would have a chance to tell the world her story, and what \nfood additives like MSG and aspartame do to any unfor tunate \norganism that comes in contact with it.  \n01:46:20:03  This radio program, The Power Hour, can be heard around the \nworld on short wave radio or the Internet every day of the \nweek in rebroadcasts or broadcasts.  \n01:46:28:15  MALE RADIO DJ: Infuriated to  the point where they're \nleaving their seats, and they're going out and becoming \nactivists, and they're demonstrating and writing letters.  \n01:46:34:21  MALE VOICE: Yes.  \n01:46:35:07  JOYCE RILEY: Well anyway, Carol Hoernlein is an expert in \nMSG and what she  has been doing is putting together \ninformation that's gonna be pretty striking to you, pretty \nunbelievable to you.  \n01:46:45:19  It's MSGTruth.org.  \n01:46:48:13  That's her website.  \n01:46:49:07  Now she became injured as a result of using MSG, but she \ndidn' t really use it; it was done to her.  \n01:46:55:24  And you were using it by the shovels, weren't you?   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n110 \n 01:46:58:05  CAROL HOERNLEIN: I was basically shoveling aspartame \nout of barrels.  \n01:47:00:22  JOYCE RILEY: Whoa! Can you believe that, listeners, \nshovelin g aspartame out of a barrel?  \n01:47:04:26  CAROL HOERNLEIN: I've had many, many, um, problems \nover the years.  \n01:47:07:12  JOYCE RILEY: What about these tabs?  \n01:47:08:12  You know, the tab drugs?  \n01:47:09:09  CAROL HOERNLEIN: Yes, um, the quick dissolve, l ike the \nListerine?  \n01:47:12:12  JOYCE RILEY: Yeah, quick dissolve, uh huh.  \n01:47:13:10  CAROL HOERNLEIN: The Listerine, um, the Listerine quick \ndissolve things, those have aspartame in them as well.  \n01:47:17:10  JOYCE RILEY: Wow. So, if you all have any qu estions, this is \nthe website to go to.  \n01:47:20:27  Now, we linked this years ago, I think, to our website, and then \nnow I have the pleasure of meeting you and right here in our \nstudios, so this is really cool.  \n01:47:29:14  This is really great.  \n01:47:30:0 7  CAROL HOERNLEIN: Oh yeah, I really appreciated that.  \n01:47:31:23  When I saw that on the web, I was so excited that you - you \nknow, you had found it, and, uh...  \n01:47:36:19  JOYCE RILEY: Oh. You've done a - ladies and gentlemen, I'd \nlike to introduce yo u today to our committee of one, Carol \nHoernlein.  \n01:47:42:28  Thank you very much, Carol, for joining us on the Power Hour \ntoday.  \n01:47:45:17  CAROL HOERNLEIN: Oh. Thank you so much.  \n01:47:46:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: If The Power Hour show allows people \nlike C arol to speak out on such topics, they have to creative \nabout staying on the air.  \n01:47:53:15  Advertisers that support the mainstream media do so because \nthey are able to tout pharmaceuticals, processed foods and \nlethal chemicals.  \n01:48:01:03  Not here.  \n01:48:02:03  What the Power Hour sells are natural products, food \nflavorings, books and DVD's.  \n01:48:09:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: After the program, I watched co -host \nDave vonKleist relaxing with Garrett in the front yard.  \n01:48:18:14  DAVE VONKLEIST: Okay. Now.  \n01:48:24:26  Okay.  \n01:48:26:27  STEVE KROSCHEL: Host Joyce Riley knew Charlotte \nGerson and was familiar with the Gerson therapy.  \n01:48:31:15  Joyce's background is in the military as a nurse, and the Gulf \nWar affected her with Gulf War Syndrome, an illness .  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n111 \n 01:48:38:03  She then produced a startling film called Beyond Treason , \nwhich documented the serious environmental degradation from \nU.S. munitions tipped with deplete uranium, as well as \nexperimental vaccines, and more.  \n01:48:49:23  The consequences of th ese activities are horrifying.  \n01:48:52:28  Radioactive depleted uranium, for example, has a half life of \n4\u00bd billion years, and has now contaminated regions of the \nMiddle East forever.  \n01:49:30:25  STEVE KROSCHEL: Joyce explained the Golf War \nSyndrome suff ered by military personnel.  \n01:49:35:03  JOYCE RILEY: The Gulf War illness is something that is a \ncombination of a lot of toxins, and I couldn't figure out why I \nwas sick, because I only flew from Alaska to Cuba during the \ntime that I was a flight nurse.  \n01:49:45:16  But I became ill.  \n01:49:46:21  I did have the vaccines.  \n01:49:48:05  A lot of the troops did have the oil well fire exposure, they had \nchemicals, biologicals, vaccines, everything involved.  \n01:49:54:22  What we do know now is that they were ful l of toxins.  \n01:49:58:24  I was a nurse for about 35 years, and during that time, I'd done \neverything from electro -convulsive therapy, which is shock \ntherapy, I had done.  \n01:50:07:07  I had been a chemo nurse, I was a director of nursing.  \n01:50:10:18  I was a nurse in a heart, lung, liver, kidney transplant unit, and \nI never appreciated food at all.  \n01:50:14:28  I never appreciated what it was for.  \n01:50:16:29  And then I became ill after the Gulf War, and it was amazing \nto me that nothing in medicine could  make me better, nothing.  \n01:50:24:11  So, I had to start looking to alternative and integrative \nmedicine.  \n01:50:28:16  Gulf war veterans were becoming ill right after the Gulf War.  \n01:50:31:17  Thousands, thousands  of them were becoming ill.  \n01:50:34:13  And we had no place to turn to.  \n01:50:37:03  We found out that there was some Gulf War veterans that had \nbeen helped by eating raw foods, vegetables, fruits, and doing \njuicing.  \n01:50:43:29  And I became aware of that.  \n01:50:46:10  But it wasn't until later  that I became aware of what I think has \nreally been a pivotal point in my life, which was going to the \nCharlotte Gerson Restoration Center in San Diego.  \n01:50:56:10  And that's what really made me understand the importance of \nwhat we eat and drink.  \n01:51: 00:17  STEVE KROSCHEL: When all this talk about vaccines came \nup, Garrett shared his own feelings about vaccines that are \ngiven to infants and school -age children.  \n01:51:08:04  There was a 90% reduction in diseases before the vaccines \nwere even introduced,  as graphs clearly show.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n112 \n 01:51:14:24  It was improved nutrition that caused the reduction, not \nvaccines.  \n01:51:19:08  Vaccines are neurotoxic.  \n01:51:21:24  And for that reason and awareness, the boy has a clear position \non the subject.  \n01:51:37:29  HOWARD STRAUS: Genetically engineered foods are \nliterally lethal.  \n01:51:42:06  STEVE KROSCHEL: It was here in San Francisco that the \nboy had the good fortune to meet the Executive Director of the \nCenter for Food Safety, Andrew Kimbrell.  \n01:51:51:26  The Center fo r Food Safety is a national nonprofit organization \nworking to protect consumers and the environment from the \nhazards of harmful food production technologies, and promote \norganic and other forms of sustainable agriculture.  \n01:52:07:08  ANDREW KIMBRELL: One of the greatest misconceptions \nwe have about genetically engineered foods is that genie is out \nof the bottle.  \n01:52:11:19  You know, you hear all the time that 60% or 70% of foods got \ngenetically modified ingredients in it.  \n01:52:17:09  Not true; 60% of processed  food has genetically engineered \ningredients.  \n01:52:22:18  Actually, almost none  of your whole foods are genetically \nengineered.  \n01:52:25:21  None of your fruits, none of your vegetables, you know, your \nmeat, your fish, most of your dairy products a re completely \nfree of genetically engineered ingredients.  \n01:52:32:22  As a matter of fact, there's only really four genetically \nengineered crops: that's, corn, cotton, canola and soy.  \n01:52:37:29  So, we have stopped genetically engineered wheat, we have \nstopped genetically engineered rice, we have stopped \ngenetically engineered fish, we have stopped these \nbiopharmaceuticals.  \n01:52:44:27  We're seeing that, really, genetically engineered food is one of \nthe great failures of modern agriculture that's been r ejected \naround the world, and not only can we stop it, we are stopping \nit. \n01:52:54:18  ANDREW KIMBRELL: There are five companies that are \nbehind GMO's.  \n01:52:57:00  You have Monsanto, Dupont, Behr, Segenta, and Dow.  \n01:53:03:04  Those are the big five com panies behind genetically \nengineered foods.  \n01:53:06:04  And they all share one thing in common: they're not \nagriculture companies, they're chemical companies.  \n01:53:11:22  And there's a reason for that.  \n01:53:13:09  Genetic engineering today means only on e thing - not all the \nstuff that's been advertised, all the myths about more food, \nmore nutritious food, tastier food - all nonsense science fiction.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n113 \n 01:53:22:00  These chemical companies have engineered these crops so they \ncan withstand more and more of t heir herbicides and \npesticides.  \n01:53:27:19  And they - selling hundreds of millions of more tons of their \nchemicals.  \n01:53:31:00  That's what they're about.  \n01:53:32:02  ANDREW KIMBRELL: I'm not surprised that Monsanto did \nnot want to interview for this f ilm. \n01:53:35:29  Monsanto has developed the technology, which has one \npurpose and one purpose alone, which is they can sell more of \ntheir herbicides.  \n01:53:44:02  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett had some homework completed \non this topic, which he found notable an d disturbing.  \n01:54:09:23  STEVE KROSCHEL: \"Monsanto should not have to \nvouchsafe the safety of biotech food, our interest is in selling \nas much as possible. Assuring its safety is the FDA's job.\"  \n01:54:20:13  But Garrett found this disturbing and confusin g. \n01:54:23:02  In a recently published book, he read another statement.  \n01:54:26:27  GARRETT: \"Ultimately, it is the food producer who is \nresponsible for assuring safety.\"  \n01:54:31:24  BETH HARRISON: Uh, so, really it's up to the good nature of \nthe biotec h companies to provide studies to the government.  \n01:54:39:23  But mostly this is an unregulated industry, and this is our food.  \n01:54:44:04  ANDREW KIMBRELL: One of the great questions people ask \nis, \"Are genetically engineered foods lethal? Are they toxi c?\" \n01:54:48:29  And the FDA gave us an answer.  \n01:54:51:15  The Food and Drug Administration has given us the answer.  \n01:54:53:10  In the '80s and '90s, they looked at these foods and said, \"Yes, \nthe process of genetic engineering can take a nontoxic food  \nand make it toxic.\"  \n01:55:00:27  It can create new allergens.  \n01:55:02:24  It can lower nutrition in foods.  \n01:55:04:09  It can lower our immune response.  \n01:55:06:15  And, in certain cases, we've even seen these foods have the \npotential to create cancer,  certain of the - this technology.  \n01:55:12:05  So, the answer is in on whether GMO foods are lethal or toxic.  \n01:55:16:21  Yes, the very process can make a safe food and turn it into a \ntoxic food, and potentially a lethal food.  \n01:55:22:25  ANDREW KIMBREL L: The objective of Monsanto is clear.  \n01:55:24:20  Monsanto has become the largest seed company in the world.  \n01:55:28:07  Monsanto is in the process of buying up all the seeds in the \nworld, which they then want to patent and control, so that \nfarmers will  not be able to save those seeds.  \n01:55:37:16  And then when they genetically engineer those seeds, and they \nwant to put something called Terminator technology in those \nseeds.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n114 \n 01:55:42:23  And this has those seeds create suicide after one growing \nseason, s o that farmers cannot save those seeds.  \n01:55:48:18  So, what Monsanto's really after is controlling all the seeds of \nthe Earth, and making sure that the farmers of the Earth cannot \nsave those seeds.  \n01:55:57:11  This becomes extremely important when you r ealize that 80% \nof all the farmers of the world depend on seed saving for their \nsurvival.  \n01:56:06:00  So, if Monsanto's able - either through patenting or through \nthis terminator technology - to destroy their ability to save \nseeds, the result will be mass  starvation.  \n01:56:16:05  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett was surprised to learn that \ncontrolling pests and all the other reasons chemicals are \napplied, including artificial fertilizers, is completely \nunnecessary.  \n01:56:24:28  There are dozens of institutions in t he U.S. alone that strive to \ndeclare the good news of sustainable agriculture.  \n01:56:31:28  STEVE KROSCHEL: Dr. Paul Hepperly demonstrated to us \nthrough many seed and field trial studies the amazing ways in \nwhich plants thrive and outperform chemically -dependent \nfields.  \n01:56:42:12  In many instances, the crop yields far exceed chemically -\ntreated farms.  \n01:56:46:26  The studies are extensive, repetitive and uplifting to anyone \nwho cherishes good health.  \n01:56:53:03  Dr. Gerson stated that the soil is our ex ternal metabolism.  \n01:56:57:08  It must be free of sprays and poisons or the body cannot heal.  \n01:57:11:16  STEVE KROSCHEL: With chemical agriculture, the water \nthat comes out of your tap may contain much more than \nfluoride and chlorine.  \n01:57:21:05  STEVE  KROSCHEL: And there's another food treatment \nprocess that could still threaten your health.  \n01:57:26:01  ANDREW KIMBRELL: We have found with the irradiation of \nfood is it does not just kill the bacteria, which is what it is used \nfor, but actually molecula rly changes the food.  \n01:57:35:04  It creates something in food called \"free radicals.\"  \n01:57:38:02  These are novel molecular elements in the food that have never \nbeen there before.  \n01:57:42:03  Uh, for example, in normal foods we have seen the creation o f \nbenzene, which is a known carcinogen.  \n01:57:48:27  We have seen a number of other toxic elements in these food \ncreated because the irradiation that fundamentally altered that \nfood.  \n01:57:56:07  ANDREW KIMBRELL: What we, I think, now understood \nabout our food crisis is it's not just a crisis of losing farms, it's \nnot just an environmental crisis.  \n01:58:03:23  It's not just a nutrition crisis.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n115 \n 01:58:05:14  It's also an ethical crisis.  \n01:58:07:08  Every decision each of us makes about the food that we buy, \nthe food that we eat, the food that we grow changes our farm \nsystem, changes the fate of the 10 billion animals used each \nyear, and so cruelly treated each year in our food system.  \n01:58:20:28  So, we have an ethical responsibility to eat well.  \n01:58:24:22   ANDREW KIMBRELL: The beautiful truth is that people \naround the world are saying, \"No,\" to GM foods, they're \nsaying, \"No,\" to irradiation.  \n01:58:29:15  They're saying, \"No,\" to food additives and they're saying, \n\"Yes,\" to organic food and beyond organic f ood. \n01:58:34:10  They're saying, \"Yes,\" to food that is local, that is appropriate \nscale, that is humane, that's biodiverse, and that's socially just.  \n01:58:41:11  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett thought that one way to stop \nsome of this is by the way we vote, if  indeed you can trust the \nvoting machines to work right.  \n01:58:58:19  STEVE KROSCHEL: How could a man who was curing \ncancer and chronic disease over 80 years ago be so \nmisunderstood?  \n01:59:04:19  It was now even within reach for this 15 -year-old boy to \nunderstand.  \n01:59:08:27  Is it at this point a race against time to consider the gift Gerson \noffered the world so long ago, before we exceed the tipping \npoint merely from an environmental standpoint?  \n01:59:27:00  STEVE KROSCHEL: During the course of our trave l, Garrett \nnoted an article in the paper about obesity.  \n01:59:32:03  After what he had learned, it wasn't a bit surprising.  \n01:59:35:11  With all these chemicals and craving for more chemicals and \nmore refined foods and sugar, we are bound to be obese and \ndie that way.  \n02:00:00:09  STEVE KROSCHEL: The Ohio Valley is the casket -making \ncapital of the world.  \n02:00:03:28  Naturally, the boy had wondered what eventually happens to \nan oversized dead person.  \n02:00:08:28  Here at Goliath Casket company, this family -owned business \nis experiencing a booming market, which Garrett credited to \npharmaceutical drugs, MSG, aspartame, vaccines, food \nirradiation, genetically modified foods, dental amalgams, water \nfluoridations, and root canals, to name a few.  \n02:00:27:15  STEVE KROSCHEL: Even the standard -size casket is an inch \nwider than it used to be.  \n02:01:22:05  KEITH DAVIS: Most people won't get in one because they're \nafraid to do that.  \n02:01:24:21  It's an omen, bad omen.  \n02:01:31:00  GARRETT: This would actually be quit e nice for the cabin up \nin Alaska in the summer.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n116 \n 02:01:34:13  You - you can close the lid, and you wouldn't get any light, and \nyou could sleep better.  \n02:01:45:19  KEITH DAVIS: Stick your fingers out.  \n02:01:54:16  Most of the people are not taller, but the y're wider and deeper.  \n02:01:58:24  One of the issues we have with oversized, uh - obesity and \noversized people, is that they're very wide, and they're also \nvery much thicker, or deeper.  \n02:02:09:10  So, our caskets have to be designed to accommodate this \nproblem.  \n02:02:12:27  Also, when we're, uh - when they ask for a cremation - and \nmany times they cannot do the cremation because the doors on \nthe retort aren't big enough.  \n02:02:21:26  Also, if they can do that, they have to be very careful of how \nthey pro cess the body in the retort to prevent the retort from \ncatching on fire, because of all the excess body fluids that may \ncatch on fire, and also cause the retort to burn down.  \n02:02:35:04  There have been several incidences where the fluids of the \nbody caug ht on fire and, uh, caused the retort to burn down.  \n02:02:41:21  This happened in Columbus and in Indianapolis.  \n02:02:50:20  STEVE KROSCHEL: With all this cross country travel, we \nhad to stop.  \n02:03:07:12  It was the home of Garrett's maternal grandmother.  \n02:03:13:14  Garrett's mother was killed in a freak accident one year and \neight months ago.  \n02:03:29:15  STEVE KROSCHEL: All living things have a distinctive \nenergy field around them that can be measured, and even \nphotographed.  \n02:03:35:00  Garrett rememb ered before he left on this trip an experiment \nwith an aerospace engineer named Christopher Wodtke.  \n02:03:41:27  In this take, what this engineer demonstrated was a comparison \nbetween a slice of cooked and uncooked organic baby carrot.  \n02:03:49:19  The coo ked carrot is on the left.  \n02:03:51:24  The uncooked is on the right.  \n02:03:54:10  The uncooked carrot has a startling line of strong energy that's \nclearly lacking in this cooked carrot that was steamed for 10 \nminutes.  \n02:04:03:27  What this means is that pasteurized food is dead.  \n02:04:07:19  Garrett held a funeral for the latest victim, the almond.  \n02:04:21:22  STEVE KROSCHEL: We then tried the experiment with a \npiece of inorganic apple and a piece of organic apple.  \n02:04:27:20  The results were more subt le, but the apple piece on the right is \norganic.  \n02:04:33:02  The left inorganic.  \n02:04:49:13  An organic tomato.  \n02:04:56:09  An inorganic tomato.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n117 \n 02:04:58:26  The photographic technique utilizes 50,000 volts and a broad \nrange of frequencies to resonate w ith the test objects, capturing \ntheir patterns for analysis, whether living or nonliving.  \n02:05:11:28  The boy found the results consistent and fascinating, an area of \nstudy that needs a closer look.  \n02:05:26:19  CHRISTOPHER WODTKE: Science is when you can  put \nnumbers to things.  \n02:05:30:12  When you can put a measurement on things, you can create a \nscience around it.  \n02:05:35:19  Kirlian photography is the iridology of the future where we can \nsee markers in the aura that's around people's bodies, and these  \nmarkers indicate where their health is deficient and where their \nhealth is fine.  \n02:05:58:28  STEVE KROSCHEL: All of the homework that Garrett did \nwas finally coming together.  \n02:06:05:14  His study of the Gerson therapy was now close to completion.  \n02:06 :09:26  The Gerson therapy is no secret - never has been - and it \nworks.  \n02:06:13:29  It is simple, but requires compliance and dedication.  \n02:06:17:18  Very basically, it utilizes fresh pressed organic juices, \ndelicious organic meals, and, oh yes, coffee,  as in coffee \nenemas.  \n02:06:32:18  STEVE KROSCHEL: Dr. Gerson gave an example of 50 \nrecovered patients in his original book in the late 1950's that \nwas representative of thousands of recoveries that that time.  \n02:06:42:07  All the patients were diagnosed w ith extremely detailed \nrecords at leading medical centers around the country.  \n02:06:48:11  During and after the treatment, the medical records from \nindependent medical centers bear out the results, and the \nresults bear out a beautiful truth.  \n02:07:02:15  STEVE KROSCHEL: Gerson cured his good friend Dr. Albert \nSchweitzer of adult onset diabetes, and then his wife of lung \ntuberculosis, and then his daughter of a rare skin disease.  \n02:07:11:25  It is something Schweitzer would never forget, and they \nexchanged letters up until Gerson's death in 1959.  \n02:07:20:12  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett thought the only reason that \ncould explain why the general public has never heard about \nthis therapy is because of this.  \n02:07:30:00  The boy is certain that many of the famous a nd talented would  \nhave changed history and culture if they could have only \nknown.  \n02:07:37:03  CHARLOTTE GERSON: Garrett, on the question of what \ndoes the pancreas do, essentially the job of the pancreas is to \ndigest food.  \n02:07:44:26  STEVE KROSCHEL: The pancreas has a key role to play in \nthe Gerson therapy, and in this boy's simple graphic, it is clear \nthe human intestinal track is longer than that of the carnivore.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n118 \n 02:07:54:15  The digestion in a human becomes quite compromised if he \nstarts to eat animal  protein, stressing the pancreas, as well as \nthe digestive tract.  \n02:08:06:08  CHARLOTTE GERSON: But the pancreas has one additional, \nvery important job, and that is to protect the body from, uh, \nmalignant cells.  \n02:08:15:29  The pancreas recognizes malign ant cells if they develop, and \ndigests and kills them, and gets rid of them.  \n02:08:24:16  When you overload the pancreas, as most Americans do, with \nexcess animal protein foods, all the jobs, all the ability of the \npancreas is used up just trying to digest  and get rid of all this \nanimal product, and there's nothing left to protect you from \nthe, uh, malignant cells.  \n02:08:47:06  The immune system is paralyzed.  \n02:08:50:14  STEVE KROSCHEL: Then the question was posed to Howard \nby the Slovenian guest how the c offee enema works.  \n02:08:55:00  SLOVENIAN GUEST: Why?  \n02:08:55:21  HOWARD STRAUS: Well, what happened was that the \ncaffeine in the coffee enema was absorbed by the hemorrhoidal \nvein, which is wrapped around your descending colon.  \n02:09:06:00  That is a vei n; it's a drainage system, not a distribution system, \nlike an artery.  \n02:09:10:29  So that - that's part of the portal venous system, which then \nbrings the caffeine directly to the liver, directly to the liver.  \n02:09:20:09  SLOVENIAN GUEST: Okay.  \n02:09:20: 22  HOWARD STRAUS: Not just the caffeine, but also some of \nthe other - other, uh, elements of coffee: cafestol and kahweol.  \n02:09:27:23  SLOVENIAN GUEST: Okay.  \n02:09:28:15  CHARLOTTE GERSON: And potassium.  \n02:09:29:20  HOWARD STRAUS: And potassium, very im portant, \npotassium.  \n02:09:31:28  SLOVENIAN GUEST: Okay.  \n02:09:32:20  HOWARD STRAUS: So then the, uh, liver is stimulated to \nproduce glutathione S -transferase and bile.  \n02:09:41:12  Now, what glutathione S -transferase does, it's a blood \ncleansing enzyme.  \n02:09:46:23  Uh, of course, pharmaceutical companies have wanted to \nproduce something that would simulate glutathione S -\ntransferase, but they can't patent it.  \n02:09:55:14  SLOVENIAN GUEST: Mmm hmm.  \n02:09:56:13  HOWARD STRAUS: Um, because if they could clean the \nblood, that would be wonderful, but they can't.  \n02:10:01:03  SLOVENIAN GUEST: Okay.  \n02:10:01:22  So we say, \"Coffee enema, coffee enema.\"  \n02:10:04:02  Now, they say, \"Go away, kid, we can't patent that.\"   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n119 \n 02:10:06:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: The coffee enema is prepared with three \ntablespoons fine ground organic coffee, then it is simmered for \n15 minutes.  \n02:10:14:12  It is then poured through a filter into a one quart container.  \n02:10:18:00  Distilled water is also added to restore it to a quart.  \n02:10:21:10  Then it is poured into an enema bucket.  \n02:10:25:26  STEVE KROSCHEL: Once the coffee has drained into the \npatient, the patient lies on his right side, knees drawn up for \napproximately 10 to 13 minutes, and then evacuates.  \n02:10:36:26  But in order for the bo y to truly be impacted on a personal \nlevel, he needed to meet cancer patients to believe it for \nhimself.  \n02:10:44:23  No more pictures, no more books.  \n02:10:47:13  Garrett wanted to go to Mexico.  \n02:11:15:04  STEVE KROSCHEL: The boy was surprised at how pl easant \nthe surroundings were, and how happy the cancer patients \nseemed.  \n02:11:21:11  They were here from all over the world.  \n02:11:23:24  Garrett ate with them and listened to their stories.  \n02:11:26:24  One of the clinic's doctors shared with Garrett a pe rsonal \nexperience about working on a movie set as a crew doctor on \nthe Hollywood movie James Cameron made called Titanic , \nwhich shot in Mexico.  \n02:11:42:04  STEVE KROSCHEL: One of the patients from New Zealand \nwas eager to visit with Garrett.  \n02:11:46:14  GARRETT: So, how long have you been here?  \n02:11:48:13  FEMALE PATIENT: Three weeks today.  \n02:11:50:15  Um, I came here straight from the Mayo clinic in Florida.  \n02:11:54:18  And I've got melanoma in my bones, spine, leg, liver, lungs \nand lumps.  \n02:12:03:07   Since I've been here, inside myself I feel hugely different: \nmuch stronger, physically, and I've lost the nausea.  \n02:12:13:00  I've had, uh - it's a little bit of a roller coaster.  \n02:12:16:04  You get some reactions while you're here.  \n02:12:19:12  Uh, I  haven't been able to check diagnostically, because it's \nonly three weeks, but within myself, I feel 100% better than \nwhen I came.  \n02:12:26:20  Um, Garrett, there was one person when I first came here who \nwasn't doing so well with the therapy.  \n02:12:32:22  And he started off doing 50% of it, um, and by the time he left, \nhe was doing very little.  \n02:12:39:20  I would recommend anyone who wanted to do this to do the \nfull therapy, otherwise it really doesn't work.  \n02:12:44:24  That's doing the juicing, the ene mas, the diet, everything.  \n02:12:48:17  And then it really works.  \n02:12:51:17  FEMALE PATIENT: So, I came here from, uh, the Mayo \nclinic, and I just finished doing radiation.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n120 \n 02:12:57:04  They told me that I had four to six months to live if I didn't do \nchemo.  \n02:13:01:15  And if I did chemo, I'd have six to eight months to live, with \nwhat I had.  \n02:13:05:22  If I had really good chemo - that's like top of the line - and I \nresponded, I might have a year.  \n02:13:10:16  So, looking at those options, I decided to look elsewhere.  \n02:13:14:10  My sister flew over to meet me, and she was reading Angola's \nbook about his recovery from cancer.  \n02:13:20:19  He had bone cancer, where he was given two weeks to live.  \n02:13:24:17  And after, um, trying the Gerson therapy f or several months \nand then adapting it, um, he's now still alive and is got the \nAngola Foundation in Australia.  \n02:13:35:09  I trust it, actually, with my life; that's why I'm here.  \n02:13:37:21  DOCTOR: In talking to Mrs. Gerson and talking...  \n02:13:39:09  STEVE KROSCHEL: And then Howard and Garrett spoke \nwith one of the clinic's doctors.  \n02:13:42:20  DOCTOR: ...both cases that we have -- \n02:13:43:28  HOWARD STRAUS: And what do you see?  \n02:13:45:00  What do you see in the first few days?  \n02:13:47:01  DOCTOR:  In the first few days, with doing the coffee enemas, \nI started notice changes.  \n02:13:51:24  Their pain starts to diminish, their energy's increasing.  \n02:13:54:21  Patients that come here, the first that went, blood pressure.  \n02:13:57:06  Blood pressure in  the first week disappears.  \n02:13:59:15  Good -bye taking blood pressure medications.  \n02:14:02:13  And the patients aren't realizing, you know, there's something \nmore here than just a coffee enema, and detox, and organic \ndiet, and juices.  \n02:14:08:06  They start to see the changes, and as I start to believe in what \nthey hope they're (words unclear).  \n02:14:13:18  And I tell them, \"It's more than hope; it's a reality.\"  \n02:14:16:13  HOWARD STRAUS: Reality.  \n02:14:17:00  DOCTOR: And it starts changing their way o f life.  \n02:14:18:23  HOWARD STRAUS: And you, as a physician, must get \nphenomenal satisfaction.  \n02:14:22:24  DOCTOR: It excites me.  \n02:14:23:27  Unbelievable to see changes in the blood work, in the X -rays.  \n02:14:27:28  Something that I can actually touch, feel, because I see these \npatients every day.  \n02:14:33:20  STEVE KROSCHEL: From Tijuana, Garrett travels south to \nmeet a cancer patient that was recovering against all odds, at \nhome with the Gerson therapy.  \n02:14:43:00  In the mountains outside San Cristob al de las Casas, Howard \nStraus guided Garrett to meet this patient, who is the same age \nas Garrett.  \n02:14:52:05  Her name is Lupita.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n121 \n 02:15:12:02  STEVE KROSCHEL: Lu pita overcame a rare form of female \ncancer that has astounded her physician, utilizing the Gerson \ntherapy under extremely difficult conditions, proved to Garrett \nthat anything is possible if one simply has faith.  \n02:15:35:23  STEVE KROSCHEL: For Lupita, fresh organic vegetables and \nfruits are not difficult to find.  \n02:15:42:12  Ironically, truly  organic produce in the United States is harder \nto come by.  \n02:16:03:11  STEVE KROSCHEL: The laboratory tests on the patients are \nextensive and carefully watched.  \n02:16:07:08  Most patients only stay at the clinic one to three weeks, and \nthen go home to re cover.  \n02:16:11:26  One study on the Gerson therapy found a 100% success rate \nwith melanoma, stage one and two.  \n02:16:18:19  Stage three, 80%, and stage four, 39% success rate.  \n02:16:23:28  For terminal patients of any cancer that orthodox medicine had \ngiven up on, 39% still recover, and that includes pancreas \ncancer, which has less than a 1% survival rate by conventional \nmedicine.  \n02:16:37:23  STEVE KROSCHEL: The Gerson institute in San Diego has \nextensive files of case histories for anyone to see.  \n02:16:4 5:12  ISSA KHALAF: At 12 months after, uh, the diagnosis of \nprostate cancer, I was cancer -free within 12 months.  \n02:16:52:10  And, uh, that was proven by the MRI and other imaging tests \nthat I had, and which found, amazingly, that the cancer was \ncompletely  gone.  \n02:17:02:20  From my sacrum, from my pelvis, from my liver and from the \nprostate.  \n02:17:08:18  32 months after diagnosis, I did yet another MRI, a second \nMRI, and that reconfirmed that the cancer was completely \ngone from my body, in all areas of my body.  \n02:17:20:24  ISSA KHALAF: And if anyone doubts this, uh, I have all the \nmedical records to prove it.  \n02:17:25:03  I brought all the medical records with me, from the doctor's \nreports to the scans to the imagings, and they prove it without, \nwithout, b eyond a doubt.  \n02:17:34:29  It's just an amazing thing.  \n02:17:36:07  STEVE KROSCHEL: The pathology reports speak for \nthemselves.  \n02:17:52:00  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett found recovered patients \neverywhere, with proof from their doctors.  \n02:17:56:27  WOMAN: Th e Gerson Therapy cured my fibromyalgia.  \n02:18:00:18  STEVE KROSCHEL: But then I showed Garrett footage I had \ntaken almost five years ago of a patient that was given a death \nsentence by conventional medicine.  \n02:18:08:26  She had extra ovarian primary perit oneal carcinoma, stage \nfour.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n122 \n 02:18:15:10  No one had ever recovered from such a cancer using orthodox \nmedicine.  \n02:18:21:14  So, here she was, using the Gerson therapy in a last ditch \neffort.  \n02:18:28:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: And now, five years later, Garrett was \nlooking at the results.  \n02:18:35:14  Was he reading her obituary?  \n02:18:38:19  This was her story.  \n02:18:43:06  WOMAN: He leaves the room and goes, you know, down the \nhall for a minute.  \n02:18:48:12  And he comes back in the door, and he crosses his han ds \nacross his chest, and just in astonishment, he looks at me and \nhe says, \"You're the only patient we have seen that has \nsurvived this diagnosis.\"  \n02:19:02:15  He said, \"This is unheard of.\"  \n02:19:05:08  And, um, so I told him that if he ever got sick to give me a call.  \n02:19:13:06  And I would help him.  \n02:19:14:25  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett wanted to push this further, and \nso he asked this patient to go back to the Mayo clinic to get a \nstatement from her diagnostic doctor that the Gerson therapy \ncured her.  \n02:19:26:05  The Mayo clinic went into a panic mode, because the doctor \ndid want to appear on camera, but he was cut off.  \n02:19:33:03  It became a waiting game.  \n02:19:34:29  WOMAN: He would have much appreciated it.  \n02:19:36:14  He'd be making a big diffe rence for the treatment of cancer and \nthe environment.  \n02:19:40:26  STEVE KROSCHEL: As a result, the doctor is quitting the \nMayo clinic to work without such restrictive boundaries.  \n02:19:46:12  But there are many others.  \n02:19:48:20  SECOND WOMAN: In 1986,  I was diagnosed with pancreas \ncancer, which has spread to my liver, gall bladder and spleen.  \n02:19:56:21  The doctors told me I had three months to live, to go home, get \nmy finances in order, and prepare to die.  \n02:20:08:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: She did the Ge rson therapy over 20 \nyears ago.  \n02:20:12:01  Garrett remembered where he started with his home school \nlesson.  \n02:20:14:29  It all came back to him quite quickly.  \n02:20:26:06  DR. DEAN EDELL: No, I don't think there's any evidence that \nanybody's ever been c ured by, uh, Gerson therapy.  \n02:20:31:07  DR. WALLACE SAMPSON: It's not right from any aspect at \nall. \n02:20:34:09  STEVE KROSCHEL: Well, has the Gerson therapy ever cured \na cancer patient?  \n02:20:37:21  DR. WALLACE SAMPSON: No, 'course not, they won't even \nrelease their records.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n123 \n 02:20:39:24  DR. STEPHEN BARRETT: I don't believe that there's any \nproof that the Gerson therapy works.  \n02:20:44:22  In other words, Charlotte Gerson was lying.  \n02:20:51:24  CHARLOTTE GERSON: There are laws against healing \ncancer.  \n02:20:54:03  The doctor is not allowed to try anything else.  \n02:20:56:28  He must use only those treatments that have already proven to \nbe failures.  \n02:21:02:14  Imagine what we could do if this could be accepted.  \n02:21:07:01  BOB: What I'd like to see is so me proof, some good scientific \nproof.  \n02:21:10:07  Scientific proof.  \n02:21:11:10  Scientific proof.  \n02:21:12:07  Scientific proof. Proof.  \n02:21:18:23  STEVE KROSCHEL: And yet, the cancer industry thrives and \ncontinues to persuade people that we are still searching for a \ncure.  \n02:21:26:00  The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer \nInstitute wouldn't even return our calls.  \n02:21:32:12  STEVE KROSCHEL: Before Garrett returned to Alaska, there \nwas one more person he wanted to meet.  \n02:21:37:11  His na me is Jay Kordich.  \n02:21:39:17  Known by millions as The Juiceman, Jay is responsible for \nselling close to $1 billion of juicers throughout the world.  \n02:21:48:23  JAY KORDICH: Well, Garrett, you know I've been doing this \nnow since 1948, ever since I had c ancer of the urinary bladder.  \n02:21:54:22  You know, uh, when I think back, I just finished playing \nfootball for the University of Southern California, and, uh, I \nwas drafted by Curly Lambeau and the Green Bay Packers.  \n02:22:05:09  And then this urinary pr oblem started.  \n02:22:07:16  I started to pass blood, and I found out it was - I had a tumor in \nmy urinary bladder, and I had remembered a class that I had on \none of my physiology classes - human anatomy classes - and I \nhad inadvertently read about Dr. Max Gerson treating Dr. \nAlbert Schweitzer, you know.  \n02:22:25:22  And I figured, my God, after I found out I had cancer of the \nbladder, I figured if this treatment was good enough for Dr. \nAlbert Schweitzer, it's gotta be good enough for me.  \n02:22:37:17  JAY KO RDICH: Never believe that much juice would come \nout of this.  \n02:22:41:10  JAY KORDICH: This - this is the juice that saved my life \nwhen I had cancer of the bladder.  \n02:22:49:03  The Gerson treatment: carrot and apple.  \n02:22:54:22  JAY KORDICH: Because of t hat, I'm here.  \n02:22:57:06  All the drinks that I made and I continue even today, and this \nhas been how long?  \n02:23:03:02  Wow. 1948.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n124 \n 02:23:05:12  My words of advice to you, bring the power of plants into your \nbody.  \n02:23:10:18  There's nothing like freshl y-made juices to nurture your 100 \ntrillion cells.  \n02:23:58:08  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett was now six miles from home.  \n02:24:01:03  His home school lesson was officially over.  \n02:24:04:03  The memories of the trip still glowed red hot in his mind.  \n02:24:08:06   Specifically, how could he possibly forget a woman who \ncarries on her father's work relentlessly, against all opposition, \nwho carries the torch of a way of life that is health care, not \nsome government agency's plan, hatched with a collection of \ndrug com panies?  \n02:24:48:02  STEVE KROSCHEL: The boy does believe in hope.  \n02:24:50:09  He believes he has a future.  \n02:24:52:19  He believes that environmental issues that confront humanity \nwill dissolve into collective solutions.  \n02:24:58:20  After all, this is our only home, and we are rational human \nbeings.  \n02:25:45:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett couldn't wait to bring this fresh -\npressed carrot juice to his neighbor, John.  \n02:26:54:02  BOB: I'd like to see some scientific proof.  \n02:26:56:13  STEVE KROSCHEL: Our ot her neighbor, Bob, the one that \nmilks the goats and was quite skeptical, was really liking what \nhe was hearing.  \n02:27:03:06  And so was his wife, up until...  \n02:27:05:06  GARRETT: Okay, so here you want to add three tablespoons \nof coffee into your boiling water.  \n02:27:11:00  Then you want to let it simmer after, for 12 minutes.  \n02:27:14:27  And, uh, pour it in a quart jar and add water so it, um, ends up \nbeing a quart.  \n02:27:20:28  Um, then you connect the tube to your arse, and then you let \nthe coffee drai n into your arse.  \n02:27:28:27  Then, uh, you let it sit for 12 minutes, and then you release it \ninto the bathroom toilet.  \n02:28:07:09  STEVE KROSCHEL: For each of us, eventually, whether \nwe're ready or not, someday it will come to an end.  \n02:28:15:09  Ther e will be no more sunrises, no minutes, hours or days.  \n02:28:20:20  All the things you collected, whether treasured or forgotten, \nwill pass to someone else.  \n02:28:27:06  Your wealth, fame and temporal power will shrivel to \nirrelevance.  \n02:28:32:25  It will  not matter what you owned or owed.  \n02:28:36:22  Your grudges, resentments, frustrations and jealousies will \nfinally disappear.  \n02:28:44:01  So, too, your hopes, ambitions, plans and to do lists will \nexpire.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n125 \n 02:28:51:15  The wins and losses that once seeme d so important will fade \naway.  \n02:28:56:18  It won't matter where you came from, or on what side of the \ntracks you lived at the end.  \n02:29:02:18  It won't matter if you're beautiful or brilliant.  \n02:29:05:23  Even your gender and skin color will be irrelev ant. \n02:29:09:29  So, what will matter?  \n02:29:11:27  How will the value of your days be measured?  \n02:29:15:03  What will matter is not what you bought but what you built, \nnot what you got but what you gave.  \n02:29:22:16  What will matter is not your success  but your significance.  \n02:29:27:10  What will matter is not what you learned but what you taught.  \n02:29:31:24  What will matter is every act of integrity, compassion, courage \nor sacrifice that enriched, empowered or encouraged others to \nemulate your examp le. \n02:29:42:19  What will matter is not your competence but your character.  \n02:29:47:03  What will matter is not how many people you knew, but how \nmany will feel a lasting loss when you're gone.  \n02:29:54:04  What will matter is not your memories but the m emories that \nlive in those who loved you.  \n02:30:05:08  A life lived that matters is not of circumstance but of choice.  \n02:31:38:20  CREDITS  \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n126 \n  \n \nAppe ndix II  \n \n  \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n127 \n THE BEAUTIFUL TRUTH - TRANSLATION INTO SPANISH  \n \n01:00:00:00  INICIO DEL PROGRAMA  \n01:00:03:04  STEVE KROSCHEL: La m\u00e1s densa oscuridad puede ser \ntraspasada por penetrantes rayos de luz .  \n01:00:09:02  Y a trav\u00e9s de una delicada arteria, se dan paso las finitas \nextensiones del milagro llamado \"vida\".  \n01:00:18:21  La Tierra: Ha existido por mucho tiempo.  \n01:00:24:10  La luz ha ba\u00f1ado gentilmente esta hermosa y compleja \nmembrana fielmente.  \n01:00:31:27  STEVE KROSCHEL: La humanidad es la \u00fanica forma de vida \nque se detiene a observar detenidamente nuestro \u00fanico hogar.  \n01:00:39:20  Nuestra inteligencia nos ha l levado hasta aqu\u00ed.  \n01:00:42:08  Y tambi\u00e9n nos ha llevado m\u00e1s cerca de otro mundo... dentro de \nnosotros.  \n01:00:47:00  Y dentro de este universo, ir\u00f3nicamente, est\u00e1 el plan para \nnuestro futuro.  \n01:00:53:01  STEVE KROSCHEL: C\u00e1ncer: Es un bio -c\u00f3digo con fallas . \n01:00:56:20  Se deleita con lo que hacemos para alimentarlo.  \n01:00:59:21  El men\u00fa que servimos a estas criaturas se vuelve cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s \nextenso.  \n01:01:05:08  Excepto que un ser humano encontr\u00f3 la forma de cerrar las \npuertas de la despensa hace mucho tiem po, en 1928.  \n01:01:16:19  Esta es su historia.  \n01:01:25:09  El famoso naturalista John Muir escribi\u00f3 una vez: \"Si uno hala \nde una simple hebra de la naturaleza, descubrir\u00e1s que est\u00e1 \nconectada con todo lo dem\u00e1s\".  \n01:01:33:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: Este joven de 1 5 a\u00f1os llamado Garrett \ncontinuamente redescubre ese hecho desde diferentes puntos \nde vista.  \n01:01:40:01  El vive con su padre en una regi\u00f3n remota de Alaska, donde \nviajar en avioneta es algo casi rutinario.  \n01:01:46:04  Desde estas alturas, se puede observ ar f\u00e1cilmente la salud de \nlos bosques, la vida silvestre e incluso el deshielo glaciar.  \n01:02:10:16  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett posee una aguda sensibilidad \nhacia la naturaleza.  \n01:02:13:20  Sus ojos ya han visto la crudeza de la naturaleza, teniendo as\u00ed \nlas respuestas a muchas preguntas incluso antes de poder leer \nsobre ellas en libros.  \n01:02:32:21  STEVE KROSCHEL: Desde que \u00e9l ten\u00eda uso de raz\u00f3n, su \nfamilia ha trabajado con animales salvajes hu\u00e9rfanos, por lo \nque su conocimiento sobre biolog\u00eda era pr\u00e1ctico en eso \ntambi\u00e9n.  \n01:02:42:06  Gracias en parte a un libro especial escrito por un Dr. Max \nGerson.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n128 \n 01:02:47:15  \u00c9l entendi\u00f3 la importancia de alimentar a un cachorro, como es \nel caso de este puercoesp\u00edn, con la mezcla exacta de alimentos, \no esa criatura mori r\u00eda r\u00e1pidamente, sobre todo en sus primeros \nd\u00edas de vida.  \n01:03:10:17  STEVE KROSCHEL: Con visitas regulares a nuestro vecino, \nBob, conseguimos esta leche de cabra sin pasteurizar.  \n01:03:15:22  Ninguna tienda podr\u00eda venderla legalmente.  \n01:03:18:22  La esp osa de Bob, Margaret, se recupera de un c\u00e1ncer de \nmama.  \n01:03:25:08  Pero recientemente ella escuch\u00f3 a Garrett hablar sobre el Dr. \nGerson, y enseguida se corri\u00f3 la voz en la comunidad sobre \nesta terapia Gerson.  \n01:03:33:22  Entre las personas que quedaron profunda y positivamente \nimpactadas estuvieron el alcalde, el electricista local, el \nbanquero, el hombre del Museo Hammer.  \n01:03:48:14  Tambi\u00e9n se sum\u00f3 el apicultor quien observ\u00f3 v\u00ednculos de la \nterapia Gerson con la salud y productividad de sus abejas.  \n01:03:56:13  Adem\u00e1s estaban el artista, los empleados de la tienda org\u00e1nica, \ny luego se obtuvo un video de Gerson.  \n01:04:06:01  CHARLOTTE GERSON: Existen leyes en contra de la \ncuraci\u00f3n del c\u00e1ncer.  \n01:04:08:09  A los m\u00e9dicos no se les permite que intenten nada m\u00e1s. \n01:04:11:05  Ellos deben aplicar s\u00f3lo esos tratamientos que se ha \ndemostrado que no funcionan.  \n01:04:16:20  Imag\u00ednense lo que podr\u00edamos hacer si esto pudiera ser \naceptado.  \n01:04:20:07  Pero hay leyes en contra de esto; no te permiten curarte.  \n01:04:23 :01  Es que hay mucho dinero por ganarse con la venta de \nf\u00e1rmacos.  \n01:04:25:14  STEVE KROSCHEL: Para el vecino diab\u00e9tico de Garrett, \nJohn, este mensaje lleg\u00f3 demasiado tarde para salvar sus \npiernas.  \n01:04:30:20  Pero quiz\u00e1s Bob, el lechero, tiene el mejor comentario sobre la \nterapia de Gerson.  \n01:04:35:27  BOB: Lo que me gustar\u00eda es ver pruebas, buenas pruebas \ncient\u00edficas.  \n01:04:41:00  STEVE KROSCHEL: Cuando un crucero arrib\u00f3 al pueblo, \nmuchos turistas quer\u00edan aprender sobre la vida animal que \npreocupaba a Garrett.  \n01:04:46:14  A \u00e9l le sorprend\u00eda lo poco que la mayor\u00eda de la gente sab\u00eda \nacerca de los animales salvajes y sus necesidades.  \n01:05:04:03  STEVE KROSCHEL: Cuando la hija del Dr. Gerson, \nCharlotte, se enter\u00f3 de esta situaci\u00f3n, ella le envi\u00f3 un peque\u00f1 o \nobsequio a Garrett.  \n01:05:21:09  Era un nuevo libro escrito por Charlotte que detallaba c\u00f3mo \nfuncionaba la terapia del Dr. Gerson.  \n01:05:27:06  Contiene argumentos f\u00e1ciles de entender sobre el c\u00e1ncer.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n129 \n 01:05:30:17  El texto ser\u00eda buena lectura, incluso pa ra un chico de 15 a\u00f1os.  \n01:05:34:12  Los cap\u00edtulos eran profundos y parec\u00edan demasiado buenos \npara ser verdad.  \n01:05:38:02  Se presentaban argumentos que despertaban la curiosidad por \naprender m\u00e1s.  \n01:05:47:26  STEVE KROSCHEL: Este momento estaba a punto d e \nconvertirse en un nuevo cap\u00edtulo en la vida de Garrett.  \n01:05:51:25  Hasta el momento, leer un libro de principio a fin era algo \ninusual para \u00e9l.  \n01:05:55:26  Pero en este caso era diferente, debido en parte a lo que se \ntrataba en el libro; era lo que \u00e9l  observaba a diario, incluso al \nhacer las tareas m\u00e1s rutinarias.  \n01:06:05:23  Algo de lo que Garrett no se hab\u00eda dado cuenta completamente \nera de las implicaciones de la potencia y poder contenidos en \nla vegetaci\u00f3n.  \n01:06:29:29  STEVE KROSCHEL: Lo que pare c\u00eda un simple refrigerio \nextra\u00eddo del huerto, tendr\u00eda tremendas implicaciones a nivel \nmundial.  \n01:06:36:03  Si la terapia de Gerson fuera aceptada e implementada, podr\u00eda \nayudar a cambiar la historia de la agricultura moderna de la \nhumanidad, el suministro de alimentos, los sistemas de salud, \nla econom\u00eda, y por supuesto, el medio ambiente.  \n01:06:48:21  Luego Garrett aprendi\u00f3 una lecci\u00f3n sobre no ser apreciado \ncuando un d\u00eda su padre limpiaba la casa y arroj\u00f3 a la basura \nuna pieza art\u00edstica hecha por el mismo Garrett.  \n01:06:56:28  Debido a su dise\u00f1o inusual, el recolector de basura la cogi\u00f3 \ncon mucho cuidado y se la dio a la polic\u00eda local, quien la \nidentific\u00f3 como una bomba, sin duda, un duro golpe a la \ncreatividad de Garrett.  \n01:07:05:21  Luego otras situacion es golpearon al joven Garrett, por lo que \nsus notas sobresalientes bajaron.  \n01:07:11:07  Su padre decidi\u00f3 que Garrett ten\u00eda que continuar con su \neducaci\u00f3n en casa.  \n01:07:13:23  Su primera lecci\u00f3n de educaci\u00f3n en casa fue acerca del Dr. \nGerson y...  \n01:07:17 :10  BOB: Me gustar\u00eda ver alguna prueba cient\u00edfica.  \n01:07:20:13  STEVE KROSCHEL: El chico no estaba seguro de c\u00f3mo \nlograr eso, pero para empezar, dedujo una analog\u00eda entre las \nminas de oro y la naturaleza humana.  \n01:07:32:04  Decidi\u00f3 que el mejor lugar par a empezar su investigaci\u00f3n era \nla biblioteca p\u00fablica.  \n01:07:36:15  No le tom\u00f3 mucho tiempo para encontrar varias fuentes \nindependientes que confirmaban puntos importantes \nmencionados en el libro original cl\u00e1sico del Dr. Gerson.  \n01:07:46:11  En base a aquel las importantes pautas, los dudosos personajes \nque crearon la historia sobre el uso del fluoruro, fascinaron al \nchico.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n130 \n 01:07:53:21  Busc\u00f3 m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n y as\u00ed aparecieron m\u00e1s irregularidades.  \n01:07:58:08  Luego Garrett comenz\u00f3 a armar un bosquejo general de lo que \nse necesitaba para confirmar exitosamente el Protocolo de \nGerson.  \n01:08:06:07  Fue cuando las palabras sobre esperanza se escribieron que \nped\u00ed que me involucraran para ayudar a documentar la \nintegridad de la Terapia Gerson.  \n01:08:15:22  GARRETT: Primero fue Gerald Cox, quien trabaj\u00f3 para el \nInstituto Mellon de Investigaci\u00f3n Industrial.  \n01:08:20:23  El Instituto Mellon, por cierto, fue el principal defensor de la \nindustria del asbesto.  \n01:08:25:26  Gerald Cox se interes\u00f3 en el fluoruro por  recomen daci\u00f3n de \nFrancis Frary, director de los laboratorios de aluminio de \nAlcoa.  \n01:08:35:02  Y luego vino un destacado cient\u00edfico en toxicolog\u00eda, el Dr. \nHodge Harold.  \n01:08:39:22  Harold Hodge fue quien supervis\u00f3 las inyecciones de plutonio \ny de uranio en huma nos. \n01:08:45:29  STEVE KROSCHEL: Harold Hodge estudi\u00f3 la cuestionada \nseguridad del fluoruro, pero debido a la presi\u00f3n conjunta de la \nComisi\u00f3n At\u00f3mica y de la industria del aluminio, tuvo que \ndecir que su uso era seguro.  \n01:08:55:12  GARRETT: Harold Hodge,  junto con un grupo de cient\u00edficos, \nayud\u00f3 a desarrollar la bomba at\u00f3mica.  \n01:08:59:25  Tambi\u00e9n estuvo el Dr. Robert Kehoe, quien trabaj\u00f3 para el \nLaboratorio Kettering.  \n01:09:04:24  All\u00e1 por los a\u00f1os 50, el Sr. Kehoe era promotor industrial de la \nCorporaci\u00f3 n Ethyl y en aquel tiempo afirmaba que el plomo en \nla gasolina era seguro.  \n01:09:14:20  Frank L. Seamans era el abogado de Alcoa y el jefe del Comit\u00e9 \nde Abogados del Fl\u00faor.  \n01:09:21:02  Y entonces hubo un experimento con perros de raza beagle, en \nel cual es tos perros ten\u00edan que respirar aire fluorado seis d\u00edas a \nla semana.  \n01:09:27:08  Como resultado, los perros sufrieron da\u00f1os terribles en sus \npulmones y en su sistema linf\u00e1tico.  \n01:09:32:04  Esta informaci\u00f3n debi\u00f3 haber sido entregada a los m\u00e9dicos y \ncient\u00ed ficos, pero en su lugar fue entregada al Comit\u00e9 de \nAbogados del Fl\u00faor, y fue desaparecida.  \n01:09:39:29  Y luego apareci\u00f3 Edward Bernays, sobrino de Sigmund Freud, \nel mago de las relaciones p\u00fablicas.  \n01:09:45:04  STEVE KROSCHEL: Vender fluoruro para el sumi nistro de \nagua potable fue f\u00e1cil para Bernays.  \n01:09:48:21  \u00c9l usaba el lema \"Conf\u00eda en tu m\u00e9dico\".  \n01:09:51:06  Hasta el d\u00eda de hoy, incluso pastillas de fluoruro son \nsuministradas a ni\u00f1os, gracias en parte a la necesidad  de usar \nfluoruro para construir l a bomba at\u00f3mica.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n131 \n 01:09:58:08  HOMBRE EN TELEVISION: Yo represento una milla de \ndistancia en tu c\u00e1mara.  \n01:10:01:03  La parte superior, dos millas.  \n01:10:02:15  Vamos a cambiar a otra c\u00e1mara.  \n01:10:04:02  Voy a salir de aqu\u00ed.  \n01:10:05:18  VOZ MASCULINA: Tre s, dos, uno, cero.  \n01:10:13:00  La onda expansiva llegar\u00e1 al \u00e1rea del punto de control en \naproximadamente medio minuto.  \n01:10:47:09  STEVE KROSCHEL: En documentos desclasificados del \ngobierno, la Comisi\u00f3n At\u00f3mica, con respecto al uso de \nfluoruro y al regis tro de seguridad cuestionable en la \nconstrucci\u00f3n de la bomba, dijo que la informaci\u00f3n que invitara \no tendiera a alentar reclamos en contra de la Comisi\u00f3n \nAt\u00f3mica o sus contratistas, deb\u00eda ser modificada o borrada en \nlos art\u00edculos a ser publicados.  \n01:11:08 :21  Situaciones similares a las de esta historia se pueden encontrar \nen otras actuales... \u00bftel\u00e9fonos celulares?  \n01:11:13:27  Un fondo de $28 millones fue asignado al Dr. George Carlos \nen los a\u00f1os 90s para probar  la seguridad en el uso de los \ncelulares, pe ro lo que descubri\u00f3 fue lo contrario.  \n01:11:22:02  El no acept\u00f3 remuneraci\u00f3n alguna.  \n01:11:24:05  Las transmisiones de los tel\u00e9fonos celulares son todav\u00eda \nmotivo de preocupaci\u00f3n en cuanto a c\u00f3mo afectan a los \ninsectos.  \n01:11:29:17  GARRETT: \u00bfEnse\u00f1an esto e n las escuelas p\u00fablicas?  \n01:11:33:02  STEVE KROSCHEL: Pero con respecto a la salud dental, la \ndieta y no el fluoruro es la que realmente desempe\u00f1a un papel \ntrascendental.  \n01:11:38:03  Esto se torn\u00f3 evidente para Garrett cuando ayud\u00f3 en una \noperaci\u00f3n sencil la de su lobo domesticado.  \n01:11:43:12  Los dientes perfectos del lobo, libres de caries, confirmaron \ndetalles mencionados en un libro de la biblioteca que \u00e9l reci\u00e9n \nhab\u00eda le\u00eddo.  \n01:11:52:06  Se llamaba Nutrici\u00f3n y Degeneraci\u00f3n F\u00edsica , escrito por un \nrecon ocido dentista, el Dr. Weston Price.  \n01:12:02:21  El Dr. Price viaj\u00f3 por el mundo con su esposa en los a\u00f1os \n1930s y visit\u00f3 culturas nativas que nunca hab\u00edan sido \nexpuestas a la dieta de la civilizaci\u00f3n moderna de harina \nrefinada, alimentos enlatados y az\u00fac ar. \n01:12:13:07  Para su sorpresa, estas personas promediaban menos del 1% de \ncaries dental.  \n01:12:17:16  Y el Dr. Price not\u00f3 algo m\u00e1s.  \n01:12:20:05  Ninguno de los integrantes de estas varias tribus y culturas \npracticaba ning\u00fan tipo de higiene dental.  \n01:12:24:18  Ni uno solo de estos habitantes hab\u00eda utilizado nunca un \ncepillo dental.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n132 \n 01:12:28:11  Pero cuando los alimentos procesados se incluyeron en su \ndieta, aparecieron la caries dental y enfermedades, y ese fue el \nprincipio del final de los que eran rob ustos y fuertes.  \n01:12:41:18  STEVE KROSCHEL: El Dr. Price estudi\u00f3 animales con dietas \ninapropiadas.  \n01:12:44:12  El resultado fue terneros de dos cabezas y gatos deformes.  \n01:12:47:26  Tambi\u00e9n observ\u00f3 una conexi\u00f3n directa entre la formaci\u00f3n del \ncr\u00e1neo hum ano y la dieta.  \n01:12:58:28  STEVE KROSCHEL: Incluso en la actualidad, el tema del \nfluoruro sigue  en discusi\u00f3n.  \n01:13:03:10  En Juneau, capital del estado de Alaska, conoc\u00ed al Director del \n\u00c1rea de Odontolog\u00eda de la ciudad.  \n01:13:09:23  DIRECTOR DEL AREA DE  ODONTOLOGIA: Con respecto \na la posici\u00f3n del estado de Alaska sobre la fluoraci\u00f3n del agua, \nel Ministerio de Salud y Servicios Sociales y la Divisi\u00f3n de \nSalud P\u00fablica apoyan la fluoraci\u00f3n del agua.  \n01:13:17:24  Pero en Alaska es una iniciativa local, y lo que ocurre en \nJuneau es por votaci\u00f3n local para reanudar la fluoraci\u00f3n del \nagua.  \n01:13:24:09  Es decir que aunque el Ministerio lo apoya, es realmente un \nasunto local, y yo tambi\u00e9n estoy involucrado con la Coalici\u00f3n \nde Ciudadanos para la Salud Dental, pero  eso no est\u00e1 en mi \ncapacidad como Director del \u00c1rea de Odontolog\u00eda.  \n01:13:36:05  STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00bfCree usted que el fluoruro en el agua \nayudar\u00e1 a prevenir la caries y dem\u00e1s?  \n01:13:40:24  \u00bfCu\u00e1l es su opini\u00f3n?  \n01:13:41:22  DIRECTOR DEL AREA DE ODONTOLOGIA: C reo que hay \nclara evidencia de los \u00faltimos 60 a\u00f1os de que el fluoruro s\u00ed \nreduce la caries dental.  \n01:13:47:06  STEVE KROSCHEL: Pero los \u00fanicos efectos del fluoruro en \nla caries dental que se han medido derivan de su aplicaci\u00f3n \nt\u00f3pica y no de beberlo.  \n01:13 :53:05  Garrett necesitaba ver los dos  lados de la medicina.  \n01:13:56:02  \u00c9l despu\u00e9s vio convincentes escenas de los videos sobre \nGerson que yo ya hab\u00eda recopilado.  \n01:14:00:14  DR. DEAN EDELL: B\u00e1sicamente, si te pones a pensar en lo \nque consiste la terapi a de Gerson, en realidad no esperar\u00edas que \ncure el c\u00e1ncer.  \n01:14:06:04  As\u00ed es que no, no creo que haya ninguna evidencia de que \nalguien alguna vez haya sido curado con la terapia de Gerson.  \n01:14:11:12  DR. WALLACE SAMPSON: No es buena de ninguna manera.  \n01:14:14:16  STEVE KROSCHEL: Bueno, \u00bfAlguna vez la terapia de \nGerson ha curado alg\u00fan enfermo de c\u00e1ncer?  \n01:14:18:02  DR. WALLACE SAMPSON: Claro que no.  \n01:14:18:18  Ellos ni siquiera muestran sus archivos.  \n01:14:20:09  DR. STEPHEN BARRETT: No hay absolutam ente ninguna \nevidencia cient\u00edfica de que \u00e9l haya curado a alguien.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n133 \n 01:14:25:00  Nunca he entrevistado a ning\u00fan paciente de Gerson.  \n01:14:28:07  Realmente no tiene sentido hacerlo.  \n01:14:29:21  STEVE KROSCHEL: Pero yo s\u00ed he entrevistado pacientes, a \nm\u00e1s de un par.  \n01:14:32:16  Estos pacientes se hab\u00edan recuperado de todo tipo de c\u00e1ncer.  \n01:14:35:21  Y, en muchos de ellos, era terminal.  \n01:14:37:18  La medicina ortodoxa los hab\u00eda abandonado y enviado a casa a \nmorir.  \n01:14:41:18  Algunos de ellos han publicado  libros sobre su recuperaci\u00f3n.  \n01:14:44:04  Viaj\u00e9 por todo el mundo, desde Holanda a Jap\u00f3n, y siempre el \nresultado era el mismo: recuperaci\u00f3n.  \n01:14:59:00  STEVE KROSCHEL: Incluso las arterias del coraz\u00f3n se \npueden recuperar.  \n01:15:08:07  STEVE KROSCHEL: C uando el pr\u00edncipe Carlos habl\u00f3 \np\u00fablicamente a favor de la terapia de Gerson, despu\u00e9s de \nobservar su eficacia, fue ridiculizado por la comunidad m\u00e9dica.  \n01:15:18:12  Sin embargo, yo ya hab\u00eda notado su firme simpat\u00eda en una \ncarta que fue enviada al Instituto  Gerson.  \n01:15:28:15  STEVE KROSCHEL: Charlotte Gerson habitualmente dicta \ncharlas sobre la famosa terapia de su padre, alrededor del \nmundo.  \n01:15:34:07  CHARLOTTE GERSON: El Dr. Gerson dijo \"Dos cosas \nclaves son la toxicidad y la deficiencia\".  \n01:15:40:27   STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett estaba  en el camino correcto \ncon su programa de educaci\u00f3n en casa, y lo que acababa de ver \nlo involucraba m\u00e1s profundamente.  \n01:15:47:25  Ahora, el mundo empezaba a parecer un poquito m\u00e1s \ncomplicado para \u00e9l.  \n01:15:52:01  Mientras estudiaba varios art\u00edculos de revistas sobre la \ncreciente incidencia del c\u00e1ncer, busc\u00f3 curiosa y \ncuidadosamente cualquier referencia sobre la terapia del Dr. \nGerson en los medios de difusi\u00f3n popular.  \n01:16:14:19  STEVE KROSCHEL: En su lugar, lo que descubr i\u00f3 en las \np\u00e1ginas de los art\u00edculos sobre c\u00e1ncer o enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas \nfue un enfoque distinto a la crisis, lo cual lo hizo sospechar.  \n01:16:26:21  Garrett quer\u00eda aprender m\u00e1s, y para su deleite, la familia de \nGerson le envi\u00f3 algunos rollos de viejas pel\u00ed culas.  \n01:16:32:25  La imagen del Dr. Gerson con su familia, cobr\u00f3 vida.  \n01:16:44:04  STEVE KROSCHEL: Descubri\u00f3 una filmaci\u00f3n de una joven \nCharlotte Gerson en sus veintes que transport\u00f3 su imaginaci\u00f3n \na las referencias hist\u00f3ricas del d\u00f3nde, por qu\u00e9 y c\u00f3mo esta \nfamilia de Alemania finalmente termin\u00f3 en los Estados \nUnidos.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n134 \n 01:17:11:21  STEVE KROSCHEL: Cuando era un joven doctor en \nAlemania, Max Gerson se inspir\u00f3 en el m\u00e9dico investigador \nh\u00fangaro, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, quien descubri\u00f3 que si los \ndoctores simpl emente se lavaban las manos entre parto y parto, \nlas mujeres ya no mor\u00edan por infecciones.  \n01:17:26:25  STEVE KROSCHEL: El fue fuertemente ridiculizado por esa \nsugerencia.  \n01:17:29:23  Gerson tambi\u00e9n fue ridiculizado despu\u00e9s de descubrir que \ncambiando la di eta pod\u00eda curar sus migra\u00f1as y luego la \ntuberculosis.  \n01:17:37:13  Un experimento cl\u00ednico se llev\u00f3 a cabo con 450 pacientes con \ntuberculosis de piel incurable.  \n01:17:43:14  Ninguno de ellos se recuper\u00f3 al principio, y Gerson estaba \ndevastado.  \n01:17:47:00  Pero se descubri\u00f3 que una enfermera hab\u00eda estado d\u00e1ndole a \nescondidas, dulces, cerveza y salchichas a los pacientes.  \n01:17:53:23  Despu\u00e9s de eso, la dieta Gerson fue estrictamente \nadministrada, logrando la recuperaci\u00f3n de 446 de los 450 \npacientes.  \n01:18:03 :12  Luego \u00e9l descubri\u00f3 que la dieta curaba el c\u00e1ncer.  \n01:18:08:09  STEVE KROSCHEL: Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, \nGerson pudo escapar de la persecuci\u00f3n Nazi hacia los Estados \nUnidos con su familia.  \n01:18:14:21  \u00c9l continu\u00f3 curando no s\u00f3lo el c\u00e1ncer, s ino tambi\u00e9n otras \nenfermedades cr\u00f3nicas.  \n01:18:18:14  Y cuando su buen amigo, el Dr. Albert Schweitzer, se enferm\u00f3 \nde diabetes, \u00e9l tambi\u00e9n lo cur\u00f3, lo que hizo que Schweitzer \ndeclarara que Gerson era: \"El genio m\u00e1s importante en la \nhistoria m\u00e9dica.\"  \n01:18: 29:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: En julio de 1946, el Senador Claude \nPepper llev\u00f3 a cabo audiencias de subcomit\u00e9 de Senado sobre \nla terapia contra el c\u00e1ncer del Dr. Gerson.  \n01:18:37:21  El sorprendente testimonio fue reportado r\u00e1pidamente por el \ncomentarista de Noti cias ABC, Raymond Graham Swing, por \nRadio ABC.  \n01:18:45:04  La reacci\u00f3n del p\u00fablico fue inmediata y favorable.  \n01:18:47:19  Pero el reportaje result\u00f3 en el despido de Raymond Graham \nSwing dos semanas m\u00e1s tarde, debido a la fuerte presi\u00f3n de las \nFarmac\u00e9utic as y el Gremio M\u00e9dico Estadounidense.  \n01:18:57:13  VOZ DEL DR. MAX GERSON: Fui investigado en cinco \nocasiones.  \n01:19:01:12  VOZ DEL REPORTERO: \u00bfQu\u00e9 quiere decir con ser \ninvestigado?  \n01:19:03:03  VOZ DEL DR. MAX GERSON: Por el Gremio M\u00e9dico.  \n01:19:04:12  VOZ DEL PERIODISTA: \u00bfEllos lo investigaron?  \n01:19:05:13  VOZ DEL DR. MAX GERSON: Si, cinco veces.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n135 \n 01:19:07:19  Cada vez que ven\u00edan, yo les mostraba los pacientes que hab\u00edan \nsido enviados a casa a morir, ya curados.  \n01:19:15:03  Todos los pacientes enviados a  casa a morir, curados.  \n01:19:19:07  El siguiente paciente enviado a casa a morir, curado.  \n01:19:23:07  STEVE KROSCHEL: Y realmente los cur\u00f3, incluidas personas \ncon distrofia muscular, como esta ni\u00f1a.  \n01:19:31:05  STEVE KROSCHEL: Las conferencias p\u00fablicas del Dr. \nGerson sobre su terapia no eran populares entre sus colegas.  \n01:19:36:10  Por ejemplo, Gerson hab\u00eda empezado a hablar p\u00fablicamente en \ncontra del tabaco desde 1920.  \n01:19:40:24  PRESENTADOR DE TELEVISI\u00d3N: Un receso para muchos \nm\u00e9dicos es usualmente s\u00f3lo el tiempo empleado en disfrutar de \nun cigarrillo.  \n01:19:46:11  Y como ellos saben lo placentero que es fumarse un cigarrillo \nsuave, de buen sabor, son muy cuidadosos al escoger la marca.  \n01:19:54:25  En una encuesta nacional repetida se les pregunt\u00f3 a   m\u00e9dicos \nde todas las ramas de la medicina en todo el pa\u00eds: \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 clase \nde cigarrillo fuma usted , doctor?\"  \n01:20:05:10  Una vez m\u00e1s, la marca m\u00e1s nombrada fue Camel.  \n01:20:08:21  S\u00ed, de acuerdo a esta encuesta nacional repetida, m\u00e1s m\u00e9dicos \nfumaban Camels  que ning\u00fan otro cigarrillo.  \n01:20:16:04  \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no cambiarse a Camel durante los siguientes 30 d\u00edas \ny ver la diferencia que \u00e9ste produce en el placer de fumar.  \n01:20:23:04  Note como los Camels le agradan a su garganta.  \n01:20:25:23  Note cuan suave y de  buen sabor puede ser un cigarrillo.  \n01:20:29:26  STEVE KROSCHEL: Y a medida que m\u00e1s detalles de la \nterapia eran revelados y entendidos, se hac\u00eda m\u00e1s evidente para \nGarrett la raz\u00f3n de tanta oposici\u00f3n a la terapia de Gerson, la \ncual se preocupa por la salud , a diferencia de la usual frase \n\u201cAsistencia M\u00e9dica\u201d.  \n01:20:41:04  Quiz\u00e1s otras prioridades estaban en juego aqu\u00ed.  \n01:20:43:27  El chico record\u00f3 la gran efectividad de un remedio que su \npadre hab\u00eda usado en su pie.  \n01:20:48:24  Los f\u00e1rmacos costosos y t\u00f3xi cos no hab\u00edan funcionado.  \n01:20:52:06  Pero con una simple mezcla de ajo picado y miel org\u00e1nica, el \nproblema de su pie desapareci\u00f3.  \n01:21:01:04  La miel org\u00e1nica tambi\u00e9n desinfect\u00f3 y aceler\u00f3 la recuperaci\u00f3n \nde heridas y raspaduras.  \n01:21:07:23  STEVE KROSC HEL: Otro producto saludable, barato y no \nt\u00f3xico que se usaba, era el per\u00f3xido de hidr\u00f3geno.  \n01:21:13:18  Se lo usaba como limpiador en el hogar e incluso \ncosm\u00e9ticamente era \u00fatil para aclarar el cabello.  \n01:21:19:14  Garrett descubri\u00f3 que aplic\u00e1ndose per\u00f3x ido de hidr\u00f3geno al \n3% en los o\u00eddos durante un tiempo, le ayudaba incluso a \nprevenir los refriados.  \n01:21:28:28  STEVE KROSCHEL: Hay muchos libros sobre remedios y \ntratamientos naturales.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n136 \n 01:21:32:26  El conocimiento es poder.  \n01:21:35:14  Garrett le dio a  su cachorro hu\u00e9rfano de alce llamado Frannie, \nsu \u00faltima botella de leche de cabra.  \n01:21:43:05  Y as\u00ed, las lecciones de educaci\u00f3n en casa de Garrett pasaron a \nuna nueva etapa.  \n01:21:46:22  Era el momento de llevar su tarea consigo en su jornada y de \nponer  todo a una prueba final.  \n01:22:03:23  STEVE KROSCHEL: Todo el soporte para el estudio y \nan\u00e1lisis cient\u00edfico de Garrett sobre la terapia de Gerson surgi\u00f3 \ndurante un desayuno con Charlotte Gerson en San Diego.  \n01:22:12:19  El hijo de Charlotte Gerson, Howar d Strauss, y un invitado \nespecial que acababa de llegar de Eslovenia, tambi\u00e9n se uni\u00f3 a \nnosotros.  \n01:22:19:24  Fue aqu\u00ed donde Garrett comparar\u00eda sus notas sobre las \ndeclaraciones del Dr. Gerson, con fuentes independientes \nexternas para comprobar si coincid \u00edan. \n01:22:29:24  HOWARD STRAUS: La amalgama dental, y su - por cierto, \nlos dentistas prefieren llamarla \"aleaci\u00f3n\", porque as\u00ed suena \nmucho m\u00e1s estable.  \n01:22:37:00  Pero la amalgama dental es la mayor y peor exposici\u00f3n al \nmercurio que la mayor\u00eda de los es tadounidenses tienen en sus \nvidas.  \n01:22:45:01  STEVE KROSCHEL: Si eso es verdad, entonces, millones de \npersonas han sufrido innecesariamente una gran cantidad de \nmales por m\u00e1s de un siglo, sin darse cuenta que la verdadera \ncausa estaba en sus cabezas.  \n01:22:55:17  Yo estaba a punto de filmar una demostraci\u00f3n que probar\u00eda \nesto sin dejar ninguna duda.  \n01:23:01:03  El Dr. Roger Eichman y el Dr. David Kennedy instalaron una \npantalla fosforescente y una luz sensible a los vapores de \nmercurio que, de existir, sa ldr\u00edan de los dientes al m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo  \nest\u00edmulo.  \n01:23:13:24  Ten\u00edamos dientes con empastes de amalgama que se colocar\u00edan \nen agua a temperatura ambiente simulando la saliva en la boca.  \n01:23:20:26  En realidad no cre\u00eda que vapores de mercurio saldr\u00edan de los \ndientes, ni que si eso ocurr\u00eda, la c\u00e1mara los podr\u00eda filmar.  \n01:23:27:01  Yo ten\u00eda tambi\u00e9n una c\u00e1mara de video a la mano para grabar el \nevento.  \n01:23:36:22  STEVE KROSCHEL: Para mi sorpresa y horror, y, como \npueden ver, la c\u00e1mara de 35 mm si grab\u00f3 los vapo res de \nmercurio que sal\u00edan de los dientes.  \n01:23:50:11  Esta era la primera vez en la historia que esto hab\u00eda sido \ncaptado por una c\u00e1mara de video.  \n01:24:01:29  STEVE KROSCHEL: Para asegurar que lo que est\u00e1n viendo es \nmercurio, ten\u00edamos a la mano un instru mento especial llamado \nDetector de Mercurio Jerome para medir los niveles.  \n01:24:12:14  DR. DAVID KENNEDY: 191.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n137 \n 01:24:14:00  STEVE KROSCHEL: 190. Mu\u00e9stramelo, por favor.  \n01:24:16:17  191. Es eso alto?  \n01:24:18:20  DR. DAVID KENNEDY: Mm, con 100 ya cerrar\u00eda n la f\u00e1brica \ny evacuar\u00edan.  \n01:24:22:02  STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00a1Vaya! Dios m\u00edo. Bueno.  \n01:24:25:09  DR. ROGER EICHMAN: Ahora, piensa en esto -- \n01:24:26:11  STEVE KROSCHEL: Apaga la luz.  \n01:24:27:17  DR. ROGER EICHMAN: Esto es a temperatura ambiente, un \ndiente, de  por lo menos 50 a\u00f1os.  \n01:24:32:24  Ha estado liberando gases por a\u00f1os, y, mm, mucha gente tiene \nla boca llena de estos.  \n01:24:41:12  STEVE KROSCHEL: As\u00ed es.  \n01:24:41:26  DR. ROGER EICHMAN: Ahora, s\u00f3lo piensa en lo que \nsuceder\u00eda si tienes media docena de p ersonas en un ascensor, \ntodos soltando vapores como \u00e9ste, y liberando gases 24 horas \nal d\u00eda, los 7 d\u00edas de la semana.  \n01:24:55:00  STEVE KROSCHEL: As\u00ed es.  \n01:24:55:13  DR. ROGER EICHMAN: \u00bfY las normas de la ASSO se basan \nen una semana de 40 horas.  \n01:24:59 :25  STEVE KROSCHEL: A continuaci\u00f3n, el Dr. Kennedy coloc\u00f3 \nen el mostrador un mezclador que los dentistas usan para \nmezclar las c\u00e1psulas de amalgama, las cuales despu\u00e9s de \nmezclarse son abiertas para colocarse como empaste en la boca \nde un paciente.  \n01:25: 16:12  Las c\u00e1psulas de amalgama luego se alinean una por una en una \nbatidora donde se baten por un rato.  \n01:25:23:16  Sin que el paciente tenga idea, las c\u00e1psulas son abiertas, as\u00ed \ncomo cualquier dentista o asistente dental lo hace.  \n01:25:30:13  \u00bfSe libera r\u00e1 vapor de mercurio?  \n01:25:32:12  A estas alturas, yo ya sab\u00eda cu\u00e1l ser\u00eda la respuesta.  \n01:25:36:06  Recuerden que \u00e9ste es un procedimiento usual que sucede \ndiariamente en todo el mundo, en los consultorios dentales \njunto a pacientes inocentes.  \n01:25:55:2 8  STEVE KROSCHEL: Las im\u00e1genes hablan por s\u00ed mismas.  \n01:25:58:02  Ser\u00eda absurdo que la Asociaci\u00f3n Dental Americana contin\u00fae \ninsistiendo que las amalgamas son saludables . \n01:26:05:13  STEVE KROSCHEL: Encienda la luz. \u00bfPodemos ver lo que \nobtuvimos?  \n01:26:09 :11  DR. DAVID KENNEDY: 252.  \n01:26:10:16  STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00a1Caramba!  \n01:26:11:05  \u00bfDebemos salir de aqu\u00ed?  \n01:26:12:05  \u00bfNos estamos envenenando aqu\u00ed?  \n01:26:13:28  DR. DAVID KENNEDY: S\u00ed, la habitaci\u00f3n se ha contaminado.  \n01:26:15:23  STEVE KROSCHEL: As\u00ed es.  \n01:26:16:29  DR. DAVID KENNEDY: Y esto no es peor que trabajar en un \nconsultorio dental.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n138 \n 01:26:19:20  DR. DAVID KENNEDY: Creo que es un crimen lo que est\u00e1n \nhaci\u00e9ndole a sus asistentes, y es que el sistema reproductivo de \nla mujer es mucho m\u00e1s sensible al me rcurio, y como resultado \nse obtiene no solamente infertilidad sino tambi\u00e9n defectos de \nnacimiento.  \n01:26:32:12  Claro que hay quienes lo niegan, pero las publicaciones \ncient\u00edficas est\u00e1n llenas  de estudios que muestran que la \nexposici\u00f3n al mercurio - ya sea  de los dientes o por trabajar en \nun consultorio dental...  \n01:26:44:03  Es obvio, ya viste la demostraci\u00f3n.  \n01:26:45:21  Hay enormes cantidades de mercurio en esos consultorios.  \n01:26:47:14  Ellos no controlan eso ni advierten a los empleados; no les dan \nni m\u00e1scaras ni protecci\u00f3n adecuadas.  \n01:26:54:24  Y como resultado, hay una gran cantidad de infertilidad entre \nlas asistentes dentales.  \n01:26:58:14  Hay un documental sobre eso.  \n01:26:59:24  Es sobre las asistentes dentales noruegas y sus vidas arruinadas \npor su trabajo cuando eran j\u00f3venes.  \n01:27:06:15  Pienso que es un crimen lo que les est\u00e1n haciendo a estas \nj\u00f3venes mujeres.  \n01:27:10:01  DR. ROGER EICHMAN: He tenido pacientes que han venido \nde otros dentistas diciendo \"Dios, lo \u00fanico que me hicieron fue \nuna limpieza dental, y me he sentido terrible por varios d\u00edas \ndespu\u00e9s de eso \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 ser\u00e1?\"  \n01:27:20:16  Bueno, ellos pulen los dientes, haciendo que una enorme  \ncantidad de mercurio se libere por varios d\u00edas hasta que se \nforma una peque\u00f1a cantidad de corro si\u00f3n en la parte superior \nque hace que las emanaciones disminuyan un poco.  \n01:27:34:01  Pero la cantidad liberada de mercurio es realmente fenomenal.  \n01:27:39:00  Y si fueran sensibles al mercurio, ser\u00edan puestos en una \nsituaci\u00f3n de alto riesgo.  \n01:27:42:1 2  Cuando estudiaba odontolog\u00eda escuch\u00e9 que los dentistas en \npromedio, sufr\u00edan de su primer ataque card\u00edaco a los 44 a\u00f1os.  \n01:27:50:02  Nuestra esperanza de vida era de 52 a\u00f1os.  \n01:27:53:25  Personalmente lo relacion\u00e9 con el uso de mercurio y empastes \nde amalgama, porque eso no suced\u00eda ni en ortodoncia ni con \nlos cirujanos.  \n01:28:05:15  STEVE KROSCHEL: Me hab\u00eda asegurado de que Garrett no \nestuviera cerca de esta demostraci\u00f3n, para que \u00e9l no inhale \nnada de los vapores de mercurio.  \n01:28:12:03  Sin embargo, p arece absurdo si se considera que muchas \npersonas andan por ah\u00ed tan tranquilos con amalgamas en sus \nbocas.  \n01:28:18:05  El Dr. Gerson hab\u00eda tenido siempre la raz\u00f3n.  \n01:28:20:13  La salud dental es fundamental para la curaci\u00f3n de las \nenfermedades cr\u00f3nicas.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n139 \n 01:28:27:08  STEVE KROSCHEL: En Colorado Springs, Colorado, hay un \ndistinguido dentista que ha hablado p\u00fablicamente por d\u00e9cadas \nsobre el fluoruro, amalgamas dentales e incluso sobre los \npeligros de los tratamientos de conductos.  \n01:28:37:09  Su nombre es D r. Hal Huggins.  \n01:28:40:02  Pero justo antes de conocerlo, Garrett cay\u00f3 en depresi\u00f3n.  \n01:28:44:22  \u00c9l parec\u00eda no poder superar la perturbadora clase de qu\u00edmica \ndel Dr. Roger Eichman sobre los mortales vapores met\u00edlicos de \nmercurio.  \n01:28:52:11  Esta lecci \u00f3n de educaci\u00f3n en casa realmente lo hab\u00eda \nimpactado.  \n01:28:57:03  Y entonces se supo la causa de su tristeza.  \n01:29:00:03  Sin saberlo, tambi\u00e9n los padres del chico hab\u00edan permitido que \nun dentista le ponga mercurio en su boca.  \n01:29:05:02  Ahora \u00e9l mismo  se ve\u00eda como un riesgo biol\u00f3gico.  \n01:29:07:17  Pero lo bueno era que estaba a punto de conocer al Dr. Hal \nHuggins, quien le dar\u00eda tranquilidad.  \n01:29:13:07  DR. HAL HUGGINS: Bueno, la mayor\u00eda de las personas que \nhe visto, que se est\u00e1n deshaciendo de sus am algamas, tienen \nalguna enfermedad extra\u00f1a.  \n01:29:19:24  \u00bfPero t\u00fa est\u00e1s interesado en prevenci\u00f3n?  \n01:29:22:01  Entonces eres el uno en 100 que va por buen camino, porque \nprevenir es mucho m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil que corregir un problema despu\u00e9s \nde ocurrido.  \n01:29:31:11  STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00c9l le pregunt\u00f3 que cu\u00e1ntos dentistas \ndicen que los empastes de mercurio son seguros.  \n01:29:34:17  DR. HAL HUGGINS: Bueno, creo que ser\u00eda muy cercano al \n100% si quieren seguir siendo dentistas en el futuro.  \n01:29:38:28  Porque la asociaci\u00f3n dental tiene ciertas reglas y normas de \nque si se le pregunta a un dentista \"\u00bfEs el mercurio t\u00f3xico?\" y \nellos contestan afirmativamente - Si ellos responden \"Bueno, \ns\u00ed, es el metal m\u00e1s venenoso en el planeta que no es radiactivo\" \n- mm, perder\u00edan su licenci a y estar\u00edan vendiendo carros usados \nal siguiente d\u00eda.  \n01:29:59:07  Lo que ellos creen y lo que pueden decir son dos cosas \ndiferentes.  \n01:30:03:11  STEVE KROSCHEL: Luego, \u00e9l quiso saber cu\u00e1les dentistas \nsab\u00edan c\u00f3mo quitar las amalgamas apropiadamente.  \n01:30:06:27  DR. HAL HUGGINS: De aquellas personas que se hacen sacar \nsus amalgamas al azar, mm, el 63%  termina con una \nenfermedad auto -inmune dentro de los siguientes seis meses, la \ncual no ten\u00edan antes de sacarse las amalgamas.  \n01:30:21:24  Algo que muy pocas personas saben - Acabo de enterarme de \neso - es que los dentistas tienen seguro contra negligencia \nm\u00e9dica.  \n01:30:29:04  Claro, eso est\u00e1 bien.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n140 \n 01:30:31:09  Pero, cuando el dentista toma el mercurio, polvo de cobre, \nesta\u00f1o, zinc y plata, y los mezcla, se  convierte en un \nfabricante, y los dentistas no tienen seguro de responsabilidad \ncivil de fabricantes de productos.  \n01:30:46:23  El golpe les caer\u00e1 precisamente donde no est\u00e1n asegurados.  \n01:30:50:11  Y es que ellos est\u00e1n poniendo una sustancia venenosa en  la \nboca de la gente y no est\u00e1n asegurados contra eso.  \n01:30:57:24  Los abogados los destruir\u00e1n, en mi opini\u00f3n.  \n01:31:03:22  Mm, si nos proyectamos de 5 a 10 a\u00f1os en el futuro, las \u00fanicas \npersonas que podr\u00e1n sacarte las amalgamas ser\u00e1n los \nabogados.  \n01:31: 09:20  STEVE KROSCHEL: El Dr. Huggins le recomend\u00f3 a Garrett \nun dentista que s\u00ed sab\u00eda c\u00f3mo sacar las amalgamas de forma \nsegura.  \n01:31:14:13  El chico record\u00f3 una pregunta que le hab\u00eda hecho al Dr. \nHuggins sobre las represalias por hablar p\u00fablicamente.  \n01:31:20:07  DR. HAL HUGGINS: S\u00ed, ha habido un sinn\u00famero de casos de \nrepresalias.  \n01:31:23:16  Lo primero que hicieron fue reunir una gran cantidad de dinero \npara suspender mi licencia por negarme a usar amalgamas y \nhacer tratamientos de conductos, y por escri bir un libro que a \nellos no les gustaba.  \n01:31:37:24  Han hecho cosas personales en contra m\u00eda y de mi familia, lo \ncual destruy\u00f3 la familia.  \n01:31:44:11  Tambi\u00e9n me destruyeron el negocio.  \n01:31:46:21  Han destruido todo lo que ten\u00eda, excepto la hipoteca d e mi \ncasa; por alguna raz\u00f3n u otra, no quer\u00edan eso.  \n01:31:56:13  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett se dio cuenta que la vida del Dr. \nHuggins habr\u00eda sido mucho m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil si se hubiera quedado \ncallado como la mayor\u00eda de los m\u00e9dicos.  \n01:32:02:17  Por lo que la surge la  pregunta...  \n01:32:04:14  GARRETT: \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 usted se puso en esta situaci\u00f3n?  \n01:32:08:16  DR. HAL HUGGINS: Si t\u00fa hubieras visto la gente que yo he \nvisto con s\u00f3lo unos pocos minutos, unas pocas horas de vida, y \nves que eso se puede cambiar, y ves a\u00f1os m\u00e1s t arde que esta \ngente ha sobrevivido, esa es mi recompensa.  \n01:32:26:03  Es por eso que sigo haciendo lo que hago.  \n01:32:29:04  STEVE KROSCHEL: Esa manera de pensar tan inspiradora, \nhizo que Garrett recordara al Dr. Gerson.  \n01:32:33:18  Pero a\u00fan as\u00ed es como David contra Goliat.  \n01:32:36:02  En esta situaci\u00f3n, la Asociaci\u00f3n Dental Americana tiene gran \npoder y control sobre la vida de un dentista, y el dentista que \nsac\u00f3 adecuadamente el empaste de amalgama de Garrett ten\u00eda \nmucho miedo de que su identidad fuera revelada en esta \npel\u00edcula.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n141 \n 01:32:49:29  Tuvimos que firmar documentos que me responsabilizaban \ndirectamente por la ruina de su carrera y de sus ingresos si \nfilmaba su rostro.  \n01:33:02:14  STEVE KROSCHEL: Audiencias sobre empastes de mercurio \nse est\u00e1n dando  ahora en Washington, lo que  esperamos ponga \nfin a este desastre con las amalgamas.  \n01:33:10:00  Al momento se estima que hay 1000 toneladas de mercurio en \nlos empastes de los estadounidenses.  \n01:33:15:19  Incre\u00edblemente, la FDA nunca ha realizado una eva luaci\u00f3n \nambiental sobre el uso de amalgamas dentales de mercurio, \nseg\u00fan dicta la ley.  \n01:33:24:29  CHARLOTTE GERSON: Es muy importante para la gente \nortodoxa evitar que los pacientes vengan a tratamientos \nalternativos, porque estos s\u00ed funcionan.  \n01:33:34:1 2  A la gente le han lavado el cerebro por tanto tiempo.  \n01:33:37:17  STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00bfPero qu\u00e9 podr\u00eda ser peor que el tema \nsobre salud dental?  \n01:33:40:15  Ciertamente, los aditivos alimentarios no podr\u00edan ser tan \nmalos.  \n01:33:43:12  HOWARD STRAUS: GMS (G lutamato Monos\u00f3dico) es - es \nun qu\u00edmico tremendamente perjudicial.  \n01:33:48:22  Lo que hace el GMS en realidad - apaga el interruptor en tu \ncerebro que dice \"Ya he comido suficiente\".  \n01:33:56:21  El problema con el GMS, sin embargo, es que es una excito -\ntoxina.  \n01:34:00:19  STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00bfY qu\u00e9 es una excito -toxina?  \n01:34:03:06  Hay miles de estudios y suficientes art\u00edculos sobre el tema \ncomo para llenar una peque\u00f1a biblioteca.  \n01:34:07:16  La evidencia se ha acumulado, y luego se acumul\u00f3 un poco \nm\u00e1s. \n01:34:11:26  Est\u00e1 ah\u00ed para que cualquiera la lea.  \n01:34:13:23  Pero la industria de alimentos procesados espera que los \nmedios de comunicaci\u00f3n y la gente com\u00fan est\u00e9n muy \nocupados, sean vagos o demasiado ingenuos como para \nentender las sutilezas del tema ci ent\u00edfico en discusi\u00f3n.  \n01:34:29:09  STEVE KROSCHEL: Pero en caso de que la gente com\u00fan \nmuestre un poco de curiosidad sobre los riesgos de \nsaborizantes como el GMS, la industria alimenticia sabiamente \nha impreso volantes y folletos para nosotros, y asi defe nder su \nfr\u00e1gil posici\u00f3n.  \n01:34:44:05  Garrett se reuni\u00f3 con los expertos en alimentos, Jack y \nAdrienne Samuels, de la compa\u00f1\u00eda \"Truth in Labeling\" \n(Veracidad en las Etiquetas).  \n01:34:49:19  JACK SAMUELS: El tema del \u00e1cido glut\u00e1mico es muy, muy \ncomplejo.  \n01:34:55:00  Y, en consecuencia, muchos trucos se pueden usar para \nconvencer a la gente de que es seguro.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n142 \n 01:35:03:17  Ellos quitaron \"glutamato monos\u00f3dico\" de muchos de sus \nproductos y lo reemplazaron con nombres de otros ingredientes \nque no dec\u00edan nada al consumidor sobre la presencia del \ncomponente reactivo del glutamato monos\u00f3dico.  \n01:35:18:25  Despu\u00e9s de que mi m\u00e9dico - quien vi\u00f3 una de mis reacciones al \nGMS - me dijera que pronto morir\u00eda por exposici\u00f3n al GMS, si \nno aprend\u00eda a evitarlo, Adrienne us\u00f3 su experiencia en \ninvestigaci\u00f3n y fue a la biblioteca, invirtiendo unas 4.000 horas \npara leer todo lo que pudo encontrar sobre GMS.  \n01:35:42:04  Para su sorpresa, se encontr\u00f3 con estudios que indicaban que el \nGMS era seguro, pero todos eran patrocinados por l a industria \ndel glutamato o por sus agentes, y ten\u00edan tantos errores hasta el \npunto de ser inservibles.  \n01:35:58:23  Y, al mismo tiempo, hab\u00edan muchos otros estudios que \ndemostraban claramente que el glutamato monos\u00f3dico era \nt\u00f3xico y peligroso.  \n01:36:06:08   STEVE KROSCHEL: Jack y Adrienne Samuels tienen una \nidea muy clara sobre las investigaciones acerca del GMS desde \nque la verdadera investigaci\u00f3n empezara sobre este aditivo.  \n01:36:14:24  Garrett todav\u00eda quer\u00eda hacer de abogado del diablo, e indag\u00f3 en \nla investigaci\u00f3n, porque ahora se estaba volviendo m\u00e1s claro \npara \u00e9l durante esta clase de educaci\u00f3n en casa que cada lado \nde un tema tiene razones para adoptar una posici\u00f3n.  \n01:36:26:21  El reto es determinar la fuerza impulsora detr\u00e1s de cualquier \nestudio ci ent\u00edfico.  \n01:36:32:11  Es el dinero o la moral?  \n01:36:35:26  Pero lo que el muchacho descubri\u00f3 - al igual que Jack y \nAdrienne Samuels - es que no hay persona, instituci\u00f3n u \norganismo alguno que haya afirmado que el GMS es seguro, \nque no tenga estrechos v\u00edn culos con las industrias de alimentos \ny/o medicamentos o que no haya sido remunerado por ellos.  \n01:36:54:22  STEVE KROSCHEL: El neurocient\u00edfico Dr. John Olney, ha \nestudiado el GMS por d\u00e9cadas.  \n01:36:59:01  \u00c9l rara vez da entrevistas debido a la atenci\u00f3n no  deseada que \nincita.  \n01:37:04:04  DR. JOHN OLNEY: Mi experiencia es en neuropatolog\u00eda \nexperimental.  \n01:37:08:01  Dirig\u00ed un estudio sobre el glutamato monos\u00f3dico y su potencial \ntoxicidad en animales beb\u00e9s.  \n01:37:20:23  Y descubr\u00ed que el glutamato destruye l as c\u00e9lulas nerviosas en \nlos cerebros en desarrollo de los animales beb\u00e9s.  \n01:37:31:15  STEVE KROSCHEL: Yo pod\u00eda entender su timidez ante las \nc\u00e1maras porque \u00e9l hab\u00eda sido una pieza importante en la \nevidencia incriminatoria contra la industria alimenticia po r \nvarios a\u00f1os.  \n01:37:40:27  Sus resultados impactan a la gente, especialmente a los padres \nde ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n143 \n 01:37:46:12  Pero cuando viajas lejos de casa, la pregunta entonces es para \nGarrett, \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 comes?\"  \n01:37:51:05  En su casa en Alaska o al visitar a la familia Gerson, su dieta \nera pr\u00e1cticamente libre de cualquier alimento procesado.  \n01:37:57:13  Toma un esfuerzo extra el conseguir productos org\u00e1nicos \ndeliciosos y/o restaurantes.  \n01:38:05:16  STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00a1Alto!  \n01:38:07:08  Despu\u00e9s de todo esto, no pens\u00e9 - ya es demasiado tarde.  \n01:38:11:17  Los qu\u00edmicos de esta comida r\u00e1pida ya surt\u00edan su efecto \nm\u00e1gico en el chico.  \n01:38:15:11  Se comi\u00f3 esta comida - en realidad, dos comidas - como si \nestuviera pose\u00eddo.  \n01:38:19:02  Para m\u00ed, fue decepcionante, pe ro forzar la situaci\u00f3n \nprobablemente ser\u00eda contraproducente.  \n01:38:23:16  \u00c9l era libre de tomar sus propias decisiones.  \n01:38:37:23  STEVE KROSCHEL: Tres horas m\u00e1s tarde, en un avi\u00f3n \nrumbo a Jackson, Mississippi, los resultados eran evidentes.  \n01:38:51:14  STEVE KROSCHEL: En Jackson, Mississippi, el chico se \nreuni\u00f3 con una incre\u00edble familia de fot\u00f3grafos, los Blaylock.  \n01:38:59:07  El Dr. Russell Blaylock es un prestigioso neurocirujano \ncertificado, autor de varios libros sobre c\u00e1ncer, excito -toxinas \ny salu d. \n01:39:08:25  Es un l\u00edder en la campa\u00f1a para advertir al p\u00fablico sobre esta \natrocidad en contra de la salud.  \n01:39:13:21  Quiz\u00e1s \"atrocidad\" sea una palabra muy fuerte.  \n01:39:17:08  Si lo que \u00e9l dice es cierto, es dif\u00edcil pensar en alguna otra.  \n01:39:22: 10  Es aqu\u00ed donde Garrett escoge ahora un refrigerio saludable.  \n01:39:26:15  Pero sin que el joven lo sepa, yo ten\u00eda planeado un peque\u00f1o \ntest. \n01:39:29:27  DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: El consumo masivo de esta \nsustancia excito -t\u00f3xica en los alimentos interfiere con las \nhabilidades de la gente de pensar, recordar y usar el lenguaje y \nas\u00ed nuestros ni\u00f1os ya no tienen la misma capacidad que ten\u00edan \nsus padres.  \n01:39:43:14  Y creo que esto se est\u00e1 agravando, porque cada vez hay m\u00e1s \nalimentos con diferentes tipos de est as excito -toxinas: cuatro, \ncinco, seis en el mismo alimento.  \n01:39:53:01  Hay ni\u00f1os - los peque\u00f1os en particular - que est\u00e1n \nconsumiendo grandes cantidades, lo que interfiere con el \ndesarrollo del cerebro, as\u00ed como destruye las conexiones entre \nlas neurona s. \n01:40:04:15  Y eso interfiere con el funcionamiento del cerebro.  \n01:40:06:10  Y eso es lo que estamos viendo en todo el pa\u00eds, y de hecho, a \nnivel mundial en los pa\u00edses industrializados.  \n01:40:11:25  DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: La raz\u00f3n por la que los \nfabrican tes de alimentos le dicen al p\u00fablico que es seguro, es \nque ellos est\u00e1n lucrando de eso.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n144 \n 01:40:18:01  Y es dif\u00edcil competir con los otros fabricantes si no se usa el \nGMS, porque es un saborizante muy poderoso.  \n01:40:26:15  As\u00ed simplemente tienden a ignorar todas las investigaciones, \naunque literalmente son miles de estudios.  \n01:40:32:06  Y siguen apareciendo m\u00e1s estudios que prueban sin lugar a \nduda que esto est\u00e1 da\u00f1ando los cerebros de la gente.  \n01:40:39:23  Adem\u00e1s est\u00e1 causando obesidad m\u00f3rbida, s\u00edndrome \nmetab\u00f3lico, diabetes, diabetes infantil, arteriosclerosis; un gran \nn\u00famero de enfermedades han sido ahora asociadas con la \nexposici\u00f3n al GMS.  \n01:40:52:14  STEVE KROSCHEL: En la mesa colocaron chips de tortilla \nque conten\u00edan GMS.  \n01:40:56:01  \u00bfHab\u00eda Garrett h echo su tarea?  \n01:40:57:13  DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: Algo que la gente no entiende \nes que esto podr\u00eda ser una toxicidad silenciosa.  \n01:41:02:09  Es decir, ellos ni siquiera saben que esto est\u00e1 ocurriendo.  \n01:41:04:22  Mucha gente me dice \"Bueno, yo no tengo n inguna reacci\u00f3n.  \n01:41:06:28  No tengo s\u00edntomas como n\u00e1useas, v\u00f3mitos o jaquecas\".  \n01:41:10:11  Bueno, muchas personas expuestas al GMS no presentan \ns\u00edntomas, pero son igualmente afectadas.  \n01:41:16:25  Y esto ocurre durante un largo per\u00edodo de tiempo: d\u00e9c adas.  \n01:41:20:16  Las neuronas est\u00e1n siendo destruidas, y mientras no pierdan \nsuficientes, no se dar\u00e1n cuenta que est\u00e1n siendo afectados por \nesta toxicidad.  \n01:41:29:13  En neurolog\u00eda, se sabe que se debe perder aproximadamente un \n90% de neuronas en un \u00e1r ea espec\u00edfica del cerebro para \ndesarrollar s\u00edntomas.  \n01:41:38:01  Entonces, cuando ya aparecen s\u00edntomas como demencia o \nenfermedad de Parkinson, etc., ya hemos perdido el 90% de \nnuestras neuronas en esa parte del cerebro y eso es muy \nimportante.  \n01:41:48:1 7  DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: Otro nuevo e importante \ndescubrimiento es que el GMS est\u00e1 fuertemente relacionado \ncon el desarrollo de c\u00e1ncer.  \n01:41:54:16  Y sabemos que aumentando la cantidad de glutamato en la \ndieta de una persona, hace que el c\u00e1ncer crezca muy  \nr\u00e1pidamente y se torne altamente invasivo.  \n01:42:03:00  Eso significa que se propaga por todo el cuerpo.  \n01:42:05:05  El problema es que nadie les dice a los pacientes con c\u00e1ncer \nque deben tener mucho cuidado con el consumo de estos \naditivos alimenticios.  \n01:42:11:28  Porque hace que el c\u00e1ncer crezca mucho m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido y se \nvuelva m\u00e1s invasivo, lo que hace menos probable que \nsobrevivan al c\u00e1ncer.  \n01:42:20:18  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett nunca comi\u00f3 esos chips de \ntortilla.  \n01:42:22:27  \u00c9l quiere mantener todas su s neuronas.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n145 \n 01:42:25:03  El n\u00famero de productos alimenticios que contienen GMS sin \nindicarlo en sus etiquetas, es casi infinito.  \n01:42:31:10  La \u00fanica manera de evitarlo es comprando productos org\u00e1nicos \ny no procesados.  \n01:42:35:17  Lo que el chico tambi\u00e9n  descubri\u00f3 es que esto era otra \nconfirmaci\u00f3n de los descubrimientos de Gerson de hace 80 \na\u00f1os.  \n01:42:41:25  Con el fin de producir un informe imparcial sobre el tema de \nalimentos procesados, el chico vol\u00f3 de Jackson, Mississippi a \nOmaha, Nebraska, a ver si  pod\u00eda entrevistar alg\u00fan relacionista \np\u00fablico de la compa\u00f1\u00eda de Alimentos ConAgra.  \n01:42:55:03  Despu\u00e9s de varias llamadas telef\u00f3nicas y un mensaje enviado \npor fax, el chico pens\u00f3 que estaba logrando algo.  \n01:43:00:12  Pero estaba equivocado.  \n01:43:01:28  Nadie de ese enorme edificio quiso hablar.  \n01:43:05:04  Esto confundi\u00f3 y alter\u00f3 al chico temporalmente.  \n01:43:13:18  STEVE KROSCHEL: En mi opini\u00f3n, tanta seguridad y la \nrenuencia a hablar demostraba arrogancia suprema, \nespecialmente si se considera que ell os nos est\u00e1n alimentando - \no al menos a algunos de nosotros - diariamente.  \n01:43:23:19  Me record\u00f3 a las instalaciones en Alaska del proyecto militar \nHAARP que investiga el clima, y a mis experiencias tratando \nde conseguir entrevistas con empresas petroler as las que me \nrechazaron rotundamente.  \n01:43:40:01  La gente nativa del norte y sus preocupaciones no son \nprioritarias.  \n01:43:43:22  El chico trat\u00f3 de contactar a ConAgra dos veces m\u00e1s, pero sin \n\u00e9xito.  \n01:43:50:19  STEVE KROSCHEL: Sin embargo, no todo esta ba perdido.  \n01:43:52:14  Fuimos al Parque Mayberry de Omaha, donde Garrett encontr\u00f3 \ngran regocijo una vez m\u00e1s.  \n01:44:06:22  HOWARD STRAUS: Tenemos que volver a Hip\u00f3crates.  \n01:44:09:00  \u00c9l dijo, lo primero es \"no hacer da\u00f1o\".  \n01:44:10:27  Bueno, todo f\u00e1rmac o produce da\u00f1o.  \n01:44:14:20  Tambi\u00e9n dijo \"Deja que el alimento sea tu medicina y que la \nmedicina sea tu alimento\".  \n01:44:20:16  Eso es muy importante, porque la comida te alimenta y te sana.  \n01:44:26:00  Son elementos naturales que tu cuerpo sabe c\u00f3mo uti lizar.  \n01:44:29:24  Tu cuerpo ha evolucionado por millones de a\u00f1os para usarlos, \nmientras que estas grandes e incre\u00edblemente lucrativas \ncompa\u00f1\u00edas en todo el mundo causan da\u00f1o, son t\u00f3xicas al \nh\u00edgado, y causan enfermedades.  \n01:44:42:24  Entonces, \u00bfc\u00f3mo puede n considerarse medicina, si lo que est\u00e1n \ncausando son enfermedades?  \n01:44:47:18  STEVE KROSCHEL: Si no pudimos hablar con ning\u00fan \nfabricante de alimentos, tal vez podr\u00edamos hablar con un \ningeniero de alimentos.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n146 \n 01:44:54:00  Conozcan a Carol Hoernlein.  \n01:44: 55:13  La conocimos en el aeropuerto de St. Louis, Missouri, y la \nestamos llevando a una entrevista de radio.  \n01:45:00:06  A lo largo del camino, tuvimos tiempo suficiente para hacer \nturismo.  \n01:45:03:09  Garrett, en particular, tuvo tiempo para asimilar m ucha \ninformaci\u00f3n.  \n01:45:07:21  Escuch\u00f3 gran parte de la conversaci\u00f3n que proven\u00eda del asiento \ndelantero acerca de otro aditivo alimentario que lo hizo \nrecordar.  \n01:45:13:26  DR. JOHN OLNEY: En 1974, hice una petici\u00f3n al \ncomisionado de la FDA con respecto a cierta evidencia que \nencontr\u00e9 sobre que el aspartame podr\u00eda causar, mm, lesiones \ncerebrales.  \n01:45:27:22  STEVE KROSCHEL:  Pero a pesar de las advertencias, el ex -\ndirector de la empresa G.D. Searle, Donald Rumsfeld, \nintrodujo el producto al mercado de to dos modos.  \n01:45:34:01  Siendo una ingeniera en alimentos bien remunerada y \nrespetada, Carol era la persona adecuada para trabajar con esta \nsustancia peligrosa.  \n01:45:39:26  No pas\u00f3 mucho tiempo y empez\u00f3 a llenarse de tumores desde \nla gl\u00e1ndula pituitaria  hasta sus ovarios.  \n01:45:44:20  Aument\u00f3 mucho de peso y sigue teniendo problemas de salud.  \n01:45:47:25  Carol nunca volver\u00e1 a ser la misma.  \n01:45:49:29  Ya no quiere volver a trabajar como ingeniera de alimentos \nporque, dice, \"No puedo trabajar en un l ugar donde s\u00e9 que \nestoy envenenando a la gente\".  \n01:45:58:13  CAROL HOERNLEIN: En realidad esta historia es peor que la \ndel tabaco, porque al menos uno puede optar por no fumar.  \n01:46:04:15  Con la comida, no hay elecci\u00f3n.  \n01:46:07:21  STEVE KROSCHEL: Ahor a ya est\u00e1bamos en la estaci\u00f3n de \nradio donde Carol tendr\u00eda la oportunidad de contarle al mundo \nsu historia, y lo que los aditivos alimentarios como el GMS y \nel aspartame le hacen a cualquier desafortunado organismo que \nentre en contacto con ellos.  \n01:46:20 :03  Este programa de radio \u201cThe Power Hour\u201d se puede escuchar \nen todo el mundo por radio de onda corta o Internet todos los \nd\u00edas, en vivo o en retransmisiones.  \n01:46:28:15  LOCUTOR  DE RADIO: Enfurecidos hasta el punto de \nlevantarse, salir y volverse activ istas; est\u00e1n protestando en las \ncalles y escribiendo cartas.  \n01:46:34:21  VOZ MASCULINA: Si.  \n01:46:35:07  JOYCE RILEY: Bueno, Carol Hoernlein es experta en GMS y \nha estado reuniendo informaci\u00f3n sorprendente e incre\u00edble para \nustedes.  \n01:46:45:19  Es MSGTr uth.org.  \n01:46:48:13  Ese es su sitio web.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n147 \n 01:46:49:07  Ella se lastim\u00f3 por usar GMS, aunque en realidad no lo usaba, \nse lo causaron a ella.  \n01:46:55:24  Y lo utilizabas en grandes cantidades, \u00bfverdad?  \n01:46:58:05  CAROL HOERNLEIN: B\u00e1sicamente yo sacaba  el aspartame \nde los barriles con palas.  \n01:47:00:22  JOYCE RILEY: \u00a1Vaya! \u00bfPueden creer eso radioyentes \u00bfsacar \nel espartame de los barriles con pala?  \n01:47:04:26  CAROL HOERNLEIN: He tenido much\u00edsimos problemas \ndurante a\u00f1os.  \n01:47:07:12  JOYCE RILEY: \u00bfY qu \u00e9 hay de aquellas tiritas?  \n01:47:08:12  Ya sabes, aquellas tiritas con el qu\u00edmico?  \n01:47:09:09  CAROL HOERNLEIN: Si, bueno, las tiritas de disoluci\u00f3n \nr\u00e1pida, como las l\u00e1minas de Listerine?  \n01:47:12:12  JOYCE RILEY: S\u00ed, esas de disoluci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida.  \n01:47:13:1 0  CAROL HOERNLEIN: Listerine, las l\u00e1minas de disoluci\u00f3n \nr\u00e1pida de Listerine tambi\u00e9n contienen aspartame.  \n01:47:17:10  JOYCE RILEY: Guau. As\u00ed que, si tienen alguna duda, pueden \nvisitar el sitio web mencionado anteriormente.  \n01:47:20:27  Nosotros publicamos  algo sobre esto en nuestro sitio web hace \na\u00f1os, y ahora tengo el placer de conocerte aqu\u00ed mismo en \nnuestros estudios, esto es realmente genial.  \n01:47:29:14  Es estupendo.  \n01:47:30:07  CAROL HOERNLEIN: Claro que s\u00ed, les agradezco mucho.  \n01:47:31:23  Cuando  vi aquello en la web, estaba tan emocionada que \nustedes lo hab\u00edan publicado, y...  \n01:47:36:19  JOYCE RILEY: Se\u00f1oras y se\u00f1ores, me gustar\u00eda presentarles \nhoy a nuestra delegada, Carol Hoernlein.  \n01:47:42:28  Muchas gracias, Carol, por estar con nosotros en \u201cThe Power \nHour\u201d el d\u00eda de hoy.  \n01:47:45:17  CAROL HOERNLEIN: Oh. Muchas gracias.  \n01:47:46:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: Si el programa \u201cThe Power Hour\u201d \npermite que personas como Carol puedan hablar sobre estos \ntemas, deben ser creativos cuando est\u00e1n al aire.  \n01:47: 53:15  Los anunciantes apoyan a los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n porque \npueden patrocinar productos farmac\u00e9uticos, alimentos \nprocesados y qu\u00edmicos letales.  \n01:48:01:03  Pero no aqu\u00ed.  \n01:48:02:03  \u201cThe Power Hour\u201d vende productos naturales, saborizantes de \nalimen tos, libros y DVD\u2019s.  \n01:48:09:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: Despu\u00e9s del programa, vi al co -\npresentador Dave vonKleist tomando un descanso con Garrett \nen el jard\u00edn delantero.  \n01:48:18:14  DAVE VONKLEIST: Est\u00e1 bien.  \n01:48:24:26  Bueno.  \n01:48:26:27  STEVE KROSCHEL: La presentadora Joyce Riley conoc\u00eda a \nCharlotte Gerson as\u00ed como a la terapia Gerson.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n148 \n 01:48:31:15  Joyce trabaj\u00f3 como enfermera en el ej\u00e9rcito, y la Guerra del \nGolfo la afect\u00f3 con el \"S\u00edndrome de la Guerra del Golfo\", una \nenfermedad.  \n01:48:38:03  Luego produjo  una alarmante pel\u00edcula llamada \u201cBeyond \nTreason\u201d, que  documentaba el grave impacto ambiental \ncausado por las municiones de EEUU revestidas con uranio \nempobrecido, vacunas experimentales, y m\u00e1s.  \n01:48:49:23  Las consecuencias de estas actividades son terri bles. \n01:48:52:28  El uranio empobrecido radioactivo, por ejemplo, tiene una vida \nmedia de 4.500 millones de a\u00f1os, habiendo contaminado las \nregiones del Medio Oriente para siempre.  \n01:49:30:25  STEVE KROSCHEL: Joyce explic\u00f3 el S\u00edndrome de la Guerra \ndel Gol fo que afect\u00f3 al personal militar.  \n01:49:35:03  JOYCE RILEY: La enfermedad de la Guerra del Golfo es \ncomo una combinaci\u00f3n de muchas toxinas, y yo no pod\u00eda \nentender por qu\u00e9 estaba enferma si tan s\u00f3lo volaba de Alaska a \nCuba mientras era enfermera de vuelo.  \n01:49:45:16  Pero me enferm\u00e9.  \n01:49:46:21  Pero s\u00ed fui vacunada.  \n01:49:48:05  Muchos soldados estuvieron expuestos al fuego de los pozos \npetroleros, a sustancias qu\u00edmicas, biol\u00f3gicas, vacunas, y todo \nlo dem\u00e1s.  \n01:49:54:22  Lo que ahora sabemos es que ellos  estaban llenos de toxinas.  \n01:49:58:24  Fui enfermera durante 35 a\u00f1os, y durante ese tiempo hice de \ntodo, desde terapia electroconvulsiva o de electroshock, ...  \n01:50:07:07  Hab\u00eda sido enfermera de quimio, y fu\u00ed directora de enfermer\u00eda.  \n01:50:10:18  Fui e nfermera en una unidad de trasplante de coraz\u00f3n, pulm\u00f3n, \nh\u00edgado y ri\u00f1\u00f3n, y nunca apreci\u00e9 la importancia de la \nalimentaci\u00f3n.  \n01:50:14:28  Nunca entend\u00ed su prop\u00f3sito.  \n01:50:16:29  Y justo me enfermo despu\u00e9s de la Guerra del Golfo, y no pod\u00eda \ncreer que nada d e la medicina tradicional pod\u00eda sanarme, nada.  \n01:50:24:11  Por eso tuve que considerar las medicinas alternativa e \nintegrativa.  \n01:50:28:16  Los veteranos de la Guerra del Golfo se enfermaban justo \ndespu\u00e9s de la guerra.  \n01:50:31:17  Miles, miles de ellos  se iban enfermando.  \n01:50:34:13  Y no sab\u00edamos a qui\u00e9n recurrir.  \n01:50:37:03  Nos enteramos de que algunos veteranos de la Guerra del \nGolfo se hab\u00edan  mejorado consumiendo alimentos crudos, \nvegetales, frutas, y jugos.  \n01:50:43:29  Y yo aprend\u00ed de eso.  \n01:50:46:10  Pero no fue sino hasta despu\u00e9s que me di cuenta de que \nrealmente ha sido un hecho crucial en mi vida el ir al Centro de \nRestauraci\u00f3n de Charlotte Gerson en San Diego.  \n01:50:56:10  Y eso fue lo que en realidad me hizo entender la importancia \nde lo  que comemos y bebemos.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n149 \n 01:51:00:17  STEVE KROSCHEL: Cuando surgi\u00f3 el tema de las vacunas, \nGarrett comparti\u00f3 su opini\u00f3n sobre las vacunas administradas a \nbeb\u00e9s y ni\u00f1os de edad escolar.  \n01:51:08:04  Hubo una disminuci\u00f3n del 90% de las enfermedades antes de \nque existieran las vacunas, como lo muestran claramente los \ngr\u00e1ficos.  \n01:51:14:24  Fue una mejor nutrici\u00f3n lo que caus\u00f3 esa diminuci\u00f3n, no las \nvacunas.  \n01:51:19:08  Las vacunas son neurot\u00f3xicas.  \n01:51:21:24  Y por esa raz\u00f3n y conocimiento, el chico tiene u na firme \nopini\u00f3n al respecto.  \n01:51:37:29  HOWARD STRAUS: Los alimentos gen\u00e9ticamente \nmodificados son literalmente letales.  \n01:51:42:06  STEVE KROSCHEL: Fue aqu\u00ed en San Francisco donde el \nchico tuvo la suerte de conocer al Director Ejecutivo del \nCentro par a la Seguridad Alimentaria, Andrew Kimbrell.  \n01:51:51:26  El Centro para la Seguridad Alimentaria es una organizaci\u00f3n \nnacional sin fines de lucro dedicada a proteger a los \nconsumidores y al medio ambiente de los peligros de las \nda\u00f1inas tecnolog\u00edas de produ cci\u00f3n de alimentos, y a promover \nla agricultura org\u00e1nica y de otras formas sostenibles.  \n01:52:07:08  ANDREW KIMBRELL: Una de las creencias m\u00e1s err\u00f3neas \nque tenemos sobre los alimentos transg\u00e9nicos es que son como \nuna caja de pandora.  \n01:52:11:19  Escuchamo s todo el tiempo que el 60% o 70% de los alimentos \ncontienen ingredientes gen\u00e9ticamente modificados.  \n01:52:17:09  Eso no es verdad; es el 60% de los alimentos procesados que \ncontiene ingredientes gen\u00e9ticamente modificados.  \n01:52:22:18  En realidad, casi ni ng\u00fan alimento no procesado est\u00e1 \ngen\u00e9ticamente modificado.  \n01:52:25:21  Ninguna fruta, ning\u00fan vegetal, ni la carne, ni el pescado, ni la \nmayor\u00eda de los derivados l\u00e1cteos contienen ingredientes \ngen\u00e9ticamente modificados.  \n01:52:32:22  De hecho, hay solamente cuatro cultivos que son \ngen\u00e9ticamente modificados: ma\u00edz, algod\u00f3n, canola y soya.  \n01:52:37:29  Nosotros hemos frenado totalmente al trigo, arroz y pescado \ngen\u00e9ticamente modificados y hemos puesto un alto a las bio -\nfarmac\u00e9uticas.  \n01:52:44:27  Estamos viendo que, en realidad, los alimentos transg\u00e9nicos \nson uno de los mayores fracasos de la agricultura moderna que \nhan sido rechazados alrededor del mundo, y no solamente \npodemos detenerlos, los estamos deteniendo.  \n01:52:54:18  ANDREW KIMBRELL: Hay cinco empresas que fabrican \nOMGs (Organismos Gen\u00e9ticamente Modificados).  \n01:52:57:00  Tenemos a Monsanto, Dupont, Behr, Segenta y Dow.  \n01:53:03:04  Esas son las cinco grandes empresas que producen alimentos \ntransg\u00e9nicos.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n150 \n 01:53:06:04  Y todas tienen algo en com\u00fan: no son empresas agr\u00edcolas, son \nempresas qu\u00edmicas.  \n01:53:11:22  Y hay una raz\u00f3n para eso.  \n01:53:13:09  La ingenier\u00eda gen\u00e9tica hoy en d\u00eda significa una sola cosa \u2013 no \neso que promocionan, los mitos sobre abundancia,  alimentos \nm\u00e1s nutritivos y de mejor sabor \u2013 todo eso es disparate de \nciencia ficci\u00f3n.  \n01:53:22:00  Estas empresas qu\u00edmicas han manipulado gen\u00e9ticamente estos \ncultivos para que sean m\u00e1s resistentes a sus herbicidas y \npesticidas.  \n01:53:27:19  Y con eso venden otros cientos de millones de toneladas m\u00e1s \nde sus qu\u00edmicos.  \n01:53:31:00  Ese es su prop\u00f3sito.  \n01:53:32:02  ANDREW KIMBRELL: No me sorprende que Monsanto no \nhaya dado una entrevista para esta pel\u00edcula.  \n01:53:35:29  Monsanto ha desarrollado la tecnolog\u00eda con el \u00fanico prop\u00f3sito \nde vender m\u00e1s de sus prop ios herbicidas.  \n01:53:44:02  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett hab\u00eda completado su tarea sobre \neste tema, que le pareci\u00f3 muy importante e inquietante.  \n01:54:09:23  STEVE KROSCHEL: \"Monsanto no deber\u00eda tener que \ngarantizar la seguridad de los alimentos transg\u00e9nicos, nuestro \ninter\u00e9s es vender tanto como sea posible. Garantizar su \nseguridad es el trabajo de la FDA.\"  \n01:54:20:13  Pero a Garrett le pareci\u00f3 \u00e9sto inquietante y confuso.  \n01:54:23:02  En un libro recientemente publicado, el chico ley\u00f3 otro \nargumento.  \n01:54:26: 27  GARRETT: \"A fin de cuentas, es el productor de los alimentos \nquien debe garantizar la seguridad\".  \n01:54:31:24  BETH HARRISON: En realidad depende de la buena voluntad \nde las compa\u00f1\u00edas biotecnol\u00f3gicas el entregar estudios al \ngobierno.  \n01:54:39:23  Pero en su mayor\u00eda, \u00e9sta es una industria no regulada, y de ah\u00ed \nnos alimentamos.  \n01:54:44:04  ANDREW KIMBRELL: Una de las m\u00e1s grandes preguntas de \nla gente es: \"\u00bfLos alimentos gen\u00e9ticamente modificados son \nletales? \u00bfSon t\u00f3xicos?\"  \n01:54:48:29  Y la FDA nos dio u na respuesta.  \n01:54:51:15  La Agencia de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA) nos ha dado \nla respuesta.  \n01:54:53:10  En los a\u00f1os 80 y 90, examinaron estos alimentos y dijeron: \"S\u00ed, \nel proceso de ingenier\u00eda gen\u00e9tica puede hacer que un alimento \nno t\u00f3xico se vuelva  t\u00f3xico\".  \n01:55:00:27  Este proceso puede crear nuevos al\u00e9rgenos.  \n01:55:02:24  Puede disminuir los nutrientes en los alimentos.  \n01:55:04:09  Puede disminuir nuestra respuesta inmune.  \n01:55:06:15  Y en ciertos casos, incluso hemos visto que estos alimentos \ntienen el potencial de causar c\u00e1ncer ... esta tecnolog\u00eda.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n151 \n 01:55:12:05  As\u00ed que ya tenemos la respuesta sobre si los alimentos \ntransg\u00e9nicos son letales o t\u00f3xicos.  \n01:55:16:21  S\u00ed, el mismo proceso puede crear un alimento saludable y \nconvertirlo en t\u00f3xico y potencialmente letal.  \n01:55:22:25  ANDREW KIMBRELL: El objetivo de Monsanto es evidente.  \n01:55:24:20  Monsanto se ha convertido en el mayor productor de semillas \nen el mundo.  \n01:55:28:07  Monsanto est\u00e1 tratando de comprar todas las semillas del \nmundo para despu\u00e9s patentarlas y controlarlas, de modo que \nlos agricultores no puedan conservar semilla alguna.  \n01:55:37:16  Y cuando ellos modifiquen gen\u00e9ticamente esas semillas, lo que \nquieren es ponerles algo llamado \"tecnolog\u00eda exterminadora\".  \n01:55:42:23  Esto h ace que las semillas se \"suiciden\" despu\u00e9s de una \ntemporada de cultivo y as\u00ed los agricultores no puedan \nconservarlas.  \n01:55:48:18  Entonces, lo que Monsanto quiere hacer es controlar todas las \nsemillas del mundo, y asegurarse de que ning\u00fan agricultor \npueda  conservarlas.  \n01:55:57:11  Esto es algo extremadamente importante porque el 80% de los \nagricultores del mundo dependen de la conservaci\u00f3n de \nsemillas para sobrevivir.  \n01:56:06:00  Si Monsanto - ya sea con patentes o usando su tecnolog\u00eda \nexterminadora - logra destruir la capacidad de los agricultores \nde conservar semillas, el resultado ser\u00eda una hambruna masiva.  \n01:56:16:05  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett se sorprendi\u00f3 al enterarse de que \nel control de plagas y el uso de qu\u00edmicos por otros motivos, \nincluyendo fert ilizantes artificiales, son cosas completamente \ninnecesarias.  \n01:56:24:28  S\u00f3lo en los Estados Unidos, hay docenas de instituciones \ntratando de dar a conocer los beneficios de la agricultura \nsostenible.  \n01:56:31:28  STEVE KROSCHEL: El Dr. Paul Hepperly nos  demostr\u00f3, a \ntrav\u00e9s de estudios y experimentos con semillas, la asombrosa \nforma como las plantas sobreviven y superan a los cultivos \nqu\u00edmico -dependientes.  \n01:56:42:12  En muchos casos, las cosechas superan ampliamente a las de \nlas granjas donde se utilizan  qu\u00edmicos.  \n01:56:46:26  Los estudios son numerosos, repetitivos e inspiradores para \ncualquiera que aprecie la buena salud.  \n01:56:53:03  Seg\u00fan Dr. Gerson, la tierra es nuestro metabolismo externo.  \n01:56:57:08  \u00c9sta debe estar libre de aerosoles y venenos pa ra que el cuerpo \npueda sanarse.  \n01:57:11:16  STEVE KROSCHEL: Debido a la agricultura qu\u00edmica, el agua \nque sale del grifo puede contener mucho m\u00e1s que s\u00f3lo fl\u00faor y \ncloro.  \n01:57:21:05  STEVE KROSCHEL: Y existe otro proceso aplicado a los \nalimentos que podr\u00eda  ser peligroso para la salud.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n152 \n 01:57:26:01  ANDREW KIMBRELL: Hemos descubierto que la irradiaci\u00f3n \nde alimentos no s\u00f3lo mata las bacterias, raz\u00f3n por la cual se la \nutiliza, sino que tambi\u00e9n cambia los alimentos a nivel \nmolecular.  \n01:57:35:04  En los alimento s se crea algo llamado \"radicales libres\".  \n01:57:38:02  Son elementos moleculares nuevos en los alimentos que nunca \nantes hab\u00edan estado ah\u00ed.  \n01:57:42:03  Por ejemplo, en alimentos t\u00edpicos hemos visto que se produce \nbenceno, un conocido carcin\u00f3geno.  \n01:57:4 8:27  Hemos visto muchos otros elementos t\u00f3xicos en los alimentos \nproducidos por la irradiaci\u00f3n, ya que \u00e9sta altera esos alimentos \nen su esencia.  \n01:57:56:07  ANDREW KIMBRELL: Lo que, yo creo, ahora entendemos \nsobre nuestra crisis alimentaria, es que no s\u00f3 lo se trata de una \ncrisis donde desaparecen granjas, no es s\u00f3lo una crisis \nambiental.  \n01:58:03:23  No es s\u00f3lo una crisis nutricional.  \n01:58:05:14  Es tambi\u00e9n una crisis \u00e9tica.  \n01:58:07:08  Cada decisi\u00f3n que tomamos sobre los alimentos que \ncompramos, comemos  y cultivamos, cambia nuestro sistema \nagr\u00edcola y el destino de los 10.000 millones de animales \nutilizados y cruelmente tratados cada a\u00f1o en nuestro sistema \nalimentario.  \n01:58:20:28  Por eso, tenemos la responsabilidad moral de comer \nsaludablemente.  \n01:58:2 4:22  ANDREW KIMBRELL: La hermosa verdad es que la gente \nalrededor del mundo esta diciendo \"No\" a los alimentos \ngen\u00e9ticamente modificados y \"No\" a la irradiaci\u00f3n.  \n01:58:29:15  Est\u00e1n diciendo \"No\" a los aditivos alimentarios y \"S\u00ed\" a los \nalimentos org\u00e1nicos  y m\u00e1s que org\u00e1nicos.  \n01:58:34:10  Est\u00e1n diciendo \"S\u00ed\" a los alimentos producidos localmente a \nuna escala apropiada, que es m\u00e1s humana, biodiversa y \nsocialmente justa.  \n01:58:41:11  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett pens\u00f3 que una forma de en algo \nparar esto es con el  voto, asumiendo que se puede confiar en \nlas m\u00e1quinas de votar.  \n01:58:58:19  STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00bfC\u00f3mo es posible que un hombre que \ncuraba el c\u00e1ncer y enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas hace m\u00e1s de 80 a\u00f1os \nfuera tan incomprendido?  \n01:59:04:19  Esto que ahora incluso para u n chico de 15 a\u00f1os resultaba f\u00e1cil \nde entender.  \n01:59:08:27  \u00bfSer\u00e1 ahora una carrera contra reloj para valorar el regalo que \nGerson le ofreci\u00f3 al mundo hace mucho tiempo, antes de que \nsea demasiado tarde desde el punto de vista meramente \nambiental?  \n01:59:2 7:00  STEVE KROSCHEL: En el transcurso de nuestro viaje, \nGarrett encontr\u00f3 un art\u00edculo en el peri\u00f3dico sobre la obesidad.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n153 \n 01:59:32:03  Despu\u00e9s de lo que hab\u00eda aprendido, no fue nada sorprendente.  \n01:59:35:11  Con todos estos qu\u00edmicos y las ansias por m\u00e1s qu \u00edmicos, \nalimentos refinados y az\u00facar, estamos destinados a ser obesos \ny a morir as\u00ed.  \n02:00:00:09  STEVE KROSCHEL: El valle de Ohio es la capital mundial en \nla fabricaci\u00f3n ata\u00fades.  \n02:00:03:28  L\u00f3gicamente, el chico se hab\u00eda preguntado qu\u00e9 pasa cuando el \ncad\u00e1ver es de gran tama\u00f1o.  \n02:00:08:28  La compa\u00f1ia de ata\u00fades Goliath, un negocio familiar, esta \nteniendo mucho \u00e9xito, el cual Garrett atribuye a las \nfarmac\u00e9uticas, al GMS, aspartame, vacunas, irradiaci\u00f3n de \nalimentos, alimentos gen\u00e9ticamente modificados, am algamas \ndentales, fl\u00faor en el agua, tratamiento de conductos, entre \notros.  \n02:00:27:15  STEVE KROSCHEL: Incluso el ata\u00fad de tama\u00f1o est\u00e1ndar es \n2,5 cm m\u00e1s ancho de lo que sol\u00eda ser.  \n02:01:22:05  KEITH DAVIS: La mayor\u00eda de la gente no entrar\u00eda en uno \nporque les da miedo.  \n02:01:24:21  Es un mal augurio.  \n02:01:31:00  GARRETT: En realidad, esto ser\u00eda excelente para la caba\u00f1a en \nAlaska en el verano.  \n02:01:34:13  Podr\u00edas cerrar el ata\u00fad, no entrar\u00eda nada de luz y dormir\u00edas \nmejor.  \n02:01:45:19  KEITH DAVIS: Saca los  dedos.  \n02:01:54:16  La mayor\u00eda de las personas no son m\u00e1s altas sino m\u00e1s anchas y \ngruesas.  \n02:01:58:24  Uno de los problemas que tenemos con las personas que sufren \nde sobrepeso, es que son muy anchas, y tambi\u00e9n mucho m\u00e1s \ngruesas.  \n02:02:09:10  Nuestros at a\u00fades tienen que ser dise\u00f1ados para ajustarse a este \nproblema.  \n02:02:12:27  Adem\u00e1s, cuando piden una cremaci\u00f3n, en muchas ocasiones no \npueden hacerla porque las puertas de los crematorios no son \ntan grandes.  \n02:02:21:26  Y cuando pueden hacerlo, tienen que  tener mucho cuidado al \nprocesar el cuerpo en el crematorio para evitar un incendio; \ndebido al exceso de fluidos corporales combustibles que \npueden hacer que el el crematorio tambi\u00e9n se queme.  \n02:02:35:04  Han habido varios accidentes en que los fluidos co rporales se \nhan encendido y han hecho que el crematorio se incendie.  \n02:02:41:21  Esto sucedi\u00f3 en Columbus y en Indian\u00e1polis.  \n02:02:50:20  STEVE KROSCHEL: Despues de tanto viajar, ya era hora de \nparar.  \n02:03:07:12  Fuimos a la casa de la abuela materna de Garrett.  \n02:03:13:14  La madre de Garrett muri\u00f3 hace un a\u00f1o y ocho meses en un \nextra\u00f1o accidente.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n154 \n 02:03:29:15  STEVE KROSCHEL: Todos los seres vivos tienen un campo \npropio de energ\u00eda que los rodea que puede ser medido e \nincluso fotografiado.  \n02:03:35:00  Garrett record\u00f3 un experimento con un ingeniero aeroespacial \nllamado Christopher Wodtke antes de empezar este viaje.  \n02:03:41:27  En esta toma, este ingeniero demuestra una comparaci\u00f3n entre \nuna rebanada de zanahoria org\u00e1nica cocida y otra cruda.  \n02:03:49:19   La zanahoria cocida est\u00e1 a la izquierda.  \n02:03:51:24  Y la cruda a la derecha.  \n02:03:54:10  La zanahoria cruda tiene una deslumbrante l\u00ednea de fuerte \nenerg\u00eda que no muestra la zanahoria que fue cocida al vapor \ndurante 10 minutos.  \n02:04:03:27  \u00c9sto signif ica que los alimentos pasteurizados est\u00e1n muertos.  \n02:04:07:19  Garrett le hizo un funeral a la \u00faltima v\u00edctima, la almendra.  \n02:04:21:22  STEVE KROSCHEL: Nosotros repetimos el experimento con \nun trozo de manzana inorg\u00e1nica y otro de manzana org\u00e1nica.  \n02:04 :27:20  Los resultados fueron menos notorios, pero el trozo de \nmanzana de la derecha es org\u00e1nico.  \n02:04:33:02  El de la izquierda inorg\u00e1nico.  \n02:04:49:13  Un tomate org\u00e1nico.  \n02:04:56:09  Un tomate inorg\u00e1nico.  \n02:04:58:26  Esta t\u00e9cnica fotogr\u00e1fica usa 50.0 00 voltios y un amplio rango \nde frecuencias que resuenan con los objetos de prueba, \ncapturando sus patrones para an\u00e1lisis, est\u00e9n vivos o no.  \n02:05:11:28  Los resultados fueron consistentes y fascinantes para el chico; \nun \u00e1rea de estudio que necesita un an\u00e1 lisis detallado.  \n02:05:26:19  CHRISTOPHER WODTKE: Hacer ciencia significa analizar \nlas cosas usando n\u00fameros.  \n02:05:30:12  Cuando se puede poner medidas a las cosas, se puede crear \nciencia.  \n02:05:35:19  La fotograf\u00eda \u201cKirlian\u201d es la iridolog\u00eda del futuro co n la que se \npuede ver marcas en el aura que rodea al cuerpo humano, y \nestas marcas indican donde hay problemas de salud y donde la \nsalud esta bien.  \n02:05:58:28  STEVE KROSCHEL: Todo el trabajo que Garrett hab\u00eda hecho \nfinalmente estaba tomando forma.  \n02:06: 05:14  Su estudio sobre la terapia Gerson estaba por completarse.  \n02:06:09:26  La terapia Gerson no es un secreto - nunca lo ha sido - y s\u00ed \nfunciona.  \n02:06:13:29  Es sencilla, pero requiere obediencia y dedicaci\u00f3n.  \n02:06:17:18  B\u00e1sicamente, consiste en con sumir jugos org\u00e1nicos reci\u00e9n \nexprimidos, deliciosas comidas org\u00e1nicas y claro, caf\u00e9, pero en \nenemas.  \n02:06:32:18  STEVE KROSCHEL: Dr. Gerson dio el ejemplo de 50 \npacientes recuperados en su libro original a finales de la \nd\u00e9cada de1950, representativos de m iles de pacientes \nrecuperados en ese tiempo.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n155 \n 02:06:42:07  Todos los pacientes fueron diagnosticados en base a \nminuciosos registros m\u00e9dicos en los principales centros \nm\u00e9dicos de todo el pa\u00eds.  \n02:06:48:11  Durante y despu\u00e9s del tratamiento, las historias cl\u00ed nicas de \ncentros m\u00e9dicos independientes confirman los resultados, y \n\u00e9stos a su vez confirman una hermosa verdad.  \n02:07:02:15  STEVE KROSCHEL: Gerson cur\u00f3 a su buen amigo, el Dr. \nAlbert Schweitzer de la diabetes de adulto, y despu\u00e9s a su \nesposa de tuberculo sis pulmonar, y despu\u00e9s a su hija de una \nrara enfermedad de la piel.  \n02:07:11:25  Es algo que Schweitzer nunca olvidar\u00eda, y ellos intercambiaron \ncartas hasta la muerte de Gerson en 1959.  \n02:07:20:12  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett pens\u00f3 que la \u00fanica raz\u00f3n que \npod\u00eda explicar por qu\u00e9 el p\u00fablico en general nunca ha o\u00eddo \nhablar de esta terapia es esto: (informaci\u00f3n detallada en forma \nescrita en el video).  \n02:07:30:00  El chico est\u00e1 seguro de que muchas personas famosas y \ntalentosas habr\u00edan cambiado la historia y cultu ra si tan s\u00f3lo \nhubieran sabido.  \n02:07:37:03  CHARLOTTE GERSON: Garrett, en cuanto a la pregunta \nsobre la funci\u00f3n del p\u00e1ncreas, b\u00e1sicamente lo que hace es \ndigerir los alimentos.  \n02:07:44:26  STEVE KROSCHEL: El p\u00e1ncreas desempe\u00f1a un papel muy \nimportante en l a terapia Gerson; est\u00e1 claro que el tracto \nintestinal humano es m\u00e1s largo que el de los carn\u00edvoros.  \n02:07:54:15  La digesti\u00f3n en los humanos se ve muy afectada cuando se \ncome prote\u00edna animal, sobrecargando al p\u00e1ncreas y al tracto \ndigestivo.  \n02:08:06:08  CHARLOTTE GERSON: Pero el p\u00e1ncreas tiene otro trabajo \nmuy importante, que es proteger al cuerpo contra c\u00e9lulas \nmalignas.  \n02:08:15:29  El p\u00e1ncreas detecta las c\u00e9lulas malignas si aparecen, las \ndigiere, las mata, y se deshace de ellas.  \n02:08:24:16  Cuando se s obrecarga al p\u00e1ncreas, como lo hacen la mayor\u00eda \nde los norteamericanos con el exceso de alimentos con \nprote\u00edna animal, toda la capacidad del p\u00e1ncreas se usa tratando \nde digerir y deshacerse de este producto de origen animal, y no \nqueda nada para protegerno s de las c\u00e9lulas malignas.  \n02:08:47:06  El sistema inmunol\u00f3gico se paraliza.  \n02:08:50:14  STEVE KROSCHEL: Luego el invitado esloveno le pregunt\u00f3 \na Howard c\u00f3mo funciona el enema de caf\u00e9.  \n02:08:55:00  INVITADO ESLOVENO: \u00bfPor qu\u00e9?  \n02:08:55:21  HOWARD STRAUS: Bueno, lo que pasa es que la cafe\u00edna en \nel enema de caf\u00e9 es absorbida por la vena hemorroidal, que \nest\u00e1 envuelta alrededor del colon descendente.  \n02:09:06:00  Es una vena; es un sistema de drenaje, no un sistema de \ndistribuci\u00f3n como es una arteria.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n156 \n 02:09:1 0:29  Es parte del sistema venoso portal que entonces lleva la cafe\u00edna \ndirectamente al h\u00edgado.  \n02:09:20:09  INVITADO ESLOVENO: Bien.  \n02:09:20:22  HOWARD STRAUS: No s\u00f3lo la cafe\u00edna, sino tambi\u00e9n otros \nelementos del caf\u00e9: cafestol y kahweol.  \n02:09:27:23  INVITADO ESLOVENO: Bien.  \n02:09:28:15  CHARLOTTE GERSON: Y potasio.  \n02:09:29:20  HOWARD STRAUS: Y potasio, muy importante, potasio.  \n02:09:31:28  INVITADO ESLOVENO: Bien.  \n02:09:32:20  HOWARD STRAUS: Entonces, el h\u00edgado es estimulado para \nproducir glutati\u00f3n S -transferasa y bilis.  \n02:09:41:12  La glutati\u00f3n S -transferasa es una enzima que limpia la sangre.  \n02:09:46:23  Y por supuesto, las compa\u00f1\u00edas farmac\u00e9uticas han querido \nproducir algo que estimule la glutati\u00f3n S -transferasa, pero no \npueden patentarla.  \n02:09:55:1 4  INVITADO ESLOVENO: Mmm.  \n02:09:56:13  HOWARD STRAUS: Porque si ellos pudieran purificar la \nsangre, ser\u00eda maravilloso, pero no pueden.  \n02:10:01:03  INVITADO ESLOVENO: Bien.  \n02:10:01:22  Entonces nosotros decimos: \"Enema de caf\u00e9, enema de caf\u00e9.\"  \n02:10:04:0 2  Y ellos nos dicen, \"Vete chico, que no podemos patentar eso\".  \n02:10:06:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: El enema de caf\u00e9 se prepara con tres \ncucharadas de caf\u00e9 org\u00e1nico molido que luego es hervido a \nfuego lento por 15 minutos.  \n02:10:14:12  Despu\u00e9s se lo vierte a tra v\u00e9s de un filtro en una jarra de un \nlitro.  \n02:10:18:00  Luego se le a\u00f1ade agua destilada hasta completar el litro.  \n02:10:21:10  Y despu\u00e9s se lo vierte en una cubeta para enemas.  \n02:10:25:26  STEVE KROSCHEL: Una vez que el caf\u00e9 ha sido introducido \nen el pac iente, \u00e9ste se recuesta sobre su lado derecho con las \nrodillas dobladas por 10 a 13 minutos aproximadamente, y \nfinalmente evacua.  \n02:10:36:26  Pero para realmente impresionar a Garrett a un nivel personal, \nel chico ten\u00eda que conocer a pacientes con c\u00e1ncer y asi \nconvencerse.  \n02:10:44:23  No m\u00e1s fotos, ni libros.  \n02:10:47:13  Garrett quer\u00eda ir a M\u00e9xico.  \n02:11:15:04  STEVE KROSCHEL: El chico se sorprendi\u00f3 con lo agradable \ndel entorno, y lo felices que parec\u00edan los pacientes con c\u00e1ncer.  \n02:11:21:11  Hab\u00eda pacie ntes de todas partes del mundo.  \n02:11:23:24  Garrett comi\u00f3 con ellos y escuch\u00f3 sus historias.  \n02:11:26:24  Uno de los m\u00e9dicos de la cl\u00ednica comparti\u00f3 una experiencia \npersonal con Garrett sobre su trabajo como m\u00e9dico del equipo \nde grabaci\u00f3n de la pel\u00edcula T itanic de James Cameron rodada \nen M\u00e9xico.  \n02:11:42:04  STEVE KROSCHEL: Una paciente de Nueva Zelanda estaba \nansiosa por conversar con Garrett.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n157 \n 02:11:46:14  GARRETT: \u00bfCu\u00e1nto tiempo llevas aqu\u00ed?  \n02:11:48:13  PACIENTE FEMENINO: Tres semanas.  \n02:11:50:15  Vine  directamente de la Cl\u00ednica Mayo de Florida.  \n02:11:54:18  Tengo melanoma en mis huesos, columna vertebral, pierna, \nh\u00edgado, pulmones y n\u00f3dulos.  \n02:12:03:07  Desde que estoy aqu\u00ed, me siento muy diferente por dentro, \nmucho m\u00e1s fuerte f\u00edsicamente, y ya no teng o nauseas.  \n02:12:13:00  He tenido algunos altibajos.  \n02:12:16:04  Se tienen ciertas reacciones mientras se est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed.  \n02:12:19:12  No he podido ser diagnosticada, ya que s\u00f3lo han pasado tres \nsemanas, pero internamente me siento 100% mejor que cuando \nllegu\u00e9 . \n02:12:26:20  Por cierto Garrett, cuando reci\u00e9n llegu\u00e9 aqu\u00ed hab\u00eda una persona \na la que no le iba muy bien en la terapia.  \n02:12:32:22  Empez\u00f3 haciendo el 50% de \u00e9sta, y antes de irse ya hac\u00eda muy \npoco.  \n02:12:39:20  Yo le recomendar\u00eda a quien quiera hacer e sto, que complete el \ntratamiento, de lo contrario no funciona.  \n02:12:44:24  Eso incluye los jugos, los enemas, la dieta, todo.  \n02:12:48:17  As\u00ed es como en realidad funciona.  \n02:12:51:17  PACIENTE FEMENINO: Vine aqu\u00ed desde la cl\u00ednica Mayo \ndonde me acababan de hacer radiaci\u00f3n.  \n02:12:57:04  Me dijeron que ten\u00eda de cuatro a seis meses de vida si no hac\u00eda \nla quimio.  \n02:13:01:15  Y si hac\u00eda la quimio, tendr\u00eda de seis a ocho meses de vida, con \nlo que ten\u00eda.  \n02:13:05:22  Si la quimio era de la mejor, y si yo respon d\u00eda bien, tal vez \nvivir\u00eda un a\u00f1o.  \n02:13:10:16  Entonces, analizando esas opciones, mejor decid\u00ed buscar algo \nm\u00e1s. \n02:13:14:10  Mi hermana viaj\u00f3 para verme y estaba leyendo el libro de \nAngola sobre de su recuperaci\u00f3n del c\u00e1ncer.  \n02:13:20:19  Angola era un ho mbre con c\u00e1ncer de huesos, y le dieron dos \nsemanas de vida.  \n02:13:24:17  Y despu\u00e9s de seguir la terapia Gerson por varios meses y luego \nadaptarla, \u00e9l sigue con vida y ahora tiene la fundaci\u00f3n Angola \nen Australia.  \n02:13:35:09  Conf\u00edo en la terapia con mi vi da, por eso estoy aqu\u00ed.  \n02:13:37:21  M\u00c9DICO: Al hablar con la se\u00f1ora Gerson y hablar...  \n02:13:39:09  STEVE KROSCHEL: Luego Howard y Garrett hablaron con \nuno de los m\u00e9dicos de la cl\u00ednica.  \n02:13:42:20  M\u00c9DICO: ... ambos casos que tenemos.  \n02:13:43:28  HOWARD STRAUS: \u00bfY qu\u00e9 es lo que ve?  \n02:13:45:00  \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que ve en los primeros d\u00edas?  \n02:13:47:01  M\u00c9DICO: En los primeros d\u00edas, usando los enemas de caf\u00e9, \nempec\u00e9 a notar cambios.  \n02:13:51:24  Su dolor empieza a disminuir y su energ\u00eda aumenta.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n158 \n 02:13:54:21  A los pacientes que vienen aqu\u00ed, lo primero que les disminuye \nes la presi\u00f3n sangu\u00ednea.  \n02:13:57:06  La presi\u00f3n alta desaparece en la primera semana.  \n02:13:59:15  Adi\u00f3s a las medicinas para la presi\u00f3n alta.  \n02:14:02:13  Y los pacientes no se dan cuenta de que a qu\u00ed hay algo m\u00e1s que \ns\u00f3lo enemas de caf\u00e9, desintoxicaci\u00f3n, dieta org\u00e1nica y jugos.  \n02:14:08:06  Ellos empiezan a ver los cambios, tal como yo empiezo a creer \nen lo que ellos esperan (palabras ilegibles).  \n02:14:13:18  Y yo les digo: \"Es algo m\u00e1s que esperan za; es una realidad\".  \n02:14:16:13  HOWARD STRAUS: Realidad.  \n02:14:17:00  M\u00c9DICO: Y empieza a cambiar su manera de vivir.  \n02:14:18:23  HOWARD STRAUS: Y usted, como m\u00e9dico, debe sentir una \ngran satisfacci\u00f3n.  \n02:14:22:24  M\u00c9DICO: Es fant\u00e1stico.  \n02:14:23:27  Es incre\u00edble ver cambios en los ex\u00e1menes de sangre y rayos X.  \n02:14:27:28  Algo que puedo tocar, sentir, porque veo a estos pacientes \ntodos los d\u00edas.  \n02:14:33:20  STEVE KROSCHEL: Desde Tijuana, Garrett viaj\u00f3 hacia el sur \na visitar a una paciente de c\u00e1ncer qu e se estaba recuperando \ncontra todo pron\u00f3stico con la terapia Gerson en su casa.  \n02:14:43:00  En las monta\u00f1as, en las afueras de San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas, \nHoward Straus llev\u00f3 a Garrett a conocer a esta paciente quien \nten\u00eda la misma edad que Garrett.  \n02:14:52:05  Su nombre era Lupita.  \n02:15:12:02  STEVE KROSCHEL: Lupita super\u00f3 un raro tipo de c\u00e1ncer \nfemenino usando la terapia Gerson en condiciones \nextremadamente dif\u00edciles asombrando a su m\u00e9dico y \ndemostrando a Garrett que todo es posible cuando se tiene fe.  \n02:15:35:23  STEVE KROSCHEL: Para Lupita, no es dif\u00edcil encontrar \nverduras y frutas org\u00e1nicas frescas.  \n02:15:42:12  Ir\u00f3nicamente, en los Estados Unidos es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil conseguir \nproductos org\u00e1nicos.  \n02:16:03:11  STEVE KROSCHEL: Las pruebas de laboratorio de  los \npacientes son exhaustivas y supervisadas cuidadosamente.  \n02:16:07:08  La mayor\u00eda de los pacientes s\u00f3lo permanecen en la cl\u00ednica de \nuna a tres semanas, y luego van a casa a recuperarse.  \n02:16:11:26  Un estudio sobre la terapia Gerson encontr\u00f3 que es 10 0% \nexitosa con el melanoma en la etapa uno y dos.  \n02:16:18:19  80% en la etapa tres y 39% en la etapa cuatro.  \n02:16:23:28  De los pacientes con cualquier tipo de c\u00e1ncer en etapa \nterminal, desahuciados por la medicina ortodoxa, el 39% a\u00fan \nse recupera, inclu yendo los que tienen c\u00e1ncer de p\u00e1ncreas, el \ncual tiene menos del 1% de tasa de supervivencia usando la \nmedicina convencional.  \n02:16:37:23  STEVE KROSCHEL: El Instituto Gerson de San Diego cuenta \ncon extensos archivos de casos que son de acceso p\u00fablico.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n159 \n 02:16:45:12  ISSA KHALAF: 12 meses despu\u00e9s de que me diagnosticaron \nc\u00e1ncer de pr\u00f3stata, qued\u00e9 completamente curado, en 12 meses.  \n02:16:52:10  Eso se comprob\u00f3 con IRM (imagen de resonancia magn\u00e9tica) \ny otras pruebas de im\u00e1genes que me hicieron y que mostraban \nque el c\u00e1ncer hab\u00eda desaparecido completamente.  \n02:17:02:20  De mi hueso sacro, pelvis, h\u00edgado y pr\u00f3stata.  \n02:17:08:18  32 meses despu\u00e9s del diagn\u00f3stico, me hice una segunda IRM, \nla que re -confirm\u00f3 que el c\u00e1ncer hab\u00eda desaparecido \ncompletamente de todas la s partes de mi cuerpo.  \n02:17:20:24  ISSA KHALAF: Y si alguien lo duda, tengo toda mi historia \ncl\u00ednica que lo demuestra.  \n02:17:25:03  Traje la historia cl\u00ednica conmigo, desde los reportes m\u00e9dicos \nde los escaneos hasta las im\u00e1genes para demostrar sin ninguna \nduda.  \n02:17:34:29  Es simplemente algo incre\u00edble.  \n02:17:36:07  STEVE KROSCHEL: Los informes de patolog\u00eda hablan por s\u00ed \nmismos.  \n02:17:52:00  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett encontr\u00f3 pacientes curados por \ntodas partes, con pruebas de sus doctores.  \n02:17:56:27  MUJER : La terapia Gerson cur\u00f3 mi fibromialgia.  \n02:18:00:18  STEVE KROSCHEL: Entonces le mostr\u00e9 a Garrett un video \nde hace casi cinco a\u00f1os de una paciente deshauciada por la \nmedicina convencional.  \n02:18:08:26  Ella ten\u00eda carcinoma peritoneal primario extraov\u00e1ric o, etapa \ncuatro.  \n02:18:15:10  Nunca nadie se hab\u00eda recuperado de \u00e9ste tipo de c\u00e1ncer con \nmedicina ortodoxa.  \n02:18:21:14  All\u00ed estaba ella, usando la terapia Gerson como su \u00faltima \nopci\u00f3n.  \n02:18:28:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: Y ahora, cinco a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, Garrett \nestaba viendo los resultados.  \n02:18:35:14  \u00bfAcaso estaba leyendo el obituario de la mujer?  \n02:18:38:19  Su historia es la siguiente.  \n02:18:43:06  MUJER: El doctor sali\u00f3 del cuarto y se fue al final del pasillo \npor un rato.  \n02:18:48:12  Luego regres\u00f3, cruz\u00f3 su s manos frente a su pecho, y con \nasombro me mir\u00f3 y me dijo: \"T\u00fa eres la \u00fanica paciente que \nhemos visto que ha sobrevivido a este diagn\u00f3stico.\"  \n02:19:02:15  Dijo: \"Esto es inaudito\".  \n02:19:05:08  As\u00ed que le dije que si alguna vez se llegara a enfermar, me \nllame.  \n02:19:13:06  Y yo lo ayudar\u00eda.  \n02:19:14:25  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett quer\u00eda m\u00e1s pruebas, por lo que \nle pidi\u00f3 a la paciente que vaya a la Cl\u00ednica Mayo y obtenga un \ncertificado del doctor que la diagnostic\u00f3 donde diga que fue la \nterapia Gerson la que la  cur\u00f3.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n160 \n 02:19:26:05  La Cl\u00ednica Mayo entr\u00f3 en p\u00e1nico, ya que el m\u00e9dico quer\u00eda dar \nla entrevista filmada, pero le prohibieron hacerlo.  \n02:19:33:03  Se convirti\u00f3 en un juego de espera.  \n02:19:34:29  MUJER: Al doctor le habr\u00eda gustado.  \n02:19:36:14  Habr\u00eda hecho  un gran beneficio en el tratamiento del c\u00e1ncer y \nal medio ambiente.  \n02:19:40:26  STEVE KROSCHEL: Como consecuencia, el doctor renunci\u00f3 \nde la Cl\u00ednica Mayo para as\u00ed poder trabajar sin tantas \nrestricciones.  \n02:19:46:12  Pero hay muchos otros casos.  \n02:19:48: 20  SEGUNDA MUJER: En 1986, me diagnosticaron c\u00e1ncer de \np\u00e1ncreas, el cual se ha propagado a mi h\u00edgado, ves\u00edcula y bazo.  \n02:19:56:21  Los m\u00e9dicos me dijeron que ten\u00eda tres meses de vida, que vaya \na mi casa, ponga mis finanzas en orden y me prepare para \nmori r. \n02:20:08:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: Ella decidi\u00f3 usar la terapia Gerson hace \n20 a\u00f1os.  \n02:20:12:01  Garrett record\u00f3 cuando comenz\u00f3 con su educaci\u00f3n en casa.  \n02:20:14:29  De repente todo volvi\u00f3 a su mente.  \n02:20:26:06  DR. DEAN EDELL: No, no creo que exista evid encia alguna \nde que alguien haya sido curado con la terapia Gerson.  \n02:20:31:07  DR. WALLACE SAMPSON: No est\u00e1 bien desde ning\u00fan punto \nde vista.  \n02:20:34:09  STEVE KROSCHEL: Veamos entonces \u00bfha curado la terapia \nGerson a alg\u00fan enfermo de c\u00e1ncer?  \n02:20:37:21   DR. WALLACE SAMPSON: No, claro que no, ni siquiera \nrevelan sus historias cl\u00ednicas.  \n02:20:39:24  DR. STEPHEN BARRETT: No creo que exista prueba alguna \nde que la terapia Gerson funciona.  \n02:20:44:22  En otras palabras, Charlotte Gerson ment\u00eda.  \n02:20:51:24  CHARLOTTE GERSON: Hay leyes que se oponen a la cura \ndel c\u00e1ncer.  \n02:20:54:03  Al m\u00e9dico no se le permite intentar nada m\u00e1s.  \n02:20:56:28  Debe usar s\u00f3lo esos tratamientos que ya sabemos que no \nfuncionan.  \n02:21:02:14  Imag\u00ednense lo que podr\u00edamos hacer si se aceptara \u00e9sto.  \n02:21:07:01  BOB: Lo que me gustar\u00eda ver es alguna prueba, alguna prueba \ncient\u00edfica v\u00e1lida.  \n02:21:10:07  Prueba cient\u00edfica.  \n02:21:11:10  Prueba cient\u00edfica.  \n02:21:12:07  Prueba cient\u00edfica. Prueba.  \n02:21:18:23  STEVE KROSCHEL: Y sin embargo, la industria del c\u00e1ncer \nsigue creciendo y convenciendo a la gente de que todav\u00eda est\u00e1n \nen busca de una cura.  \n02:21:26:00  La Sociedad Americana contra el C\u00e1ncer y el Instituto \nNacional del C\u00e1ncer ni siquiera han devuelto nuestras \nllamadas.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n161 \n 02:21:32:12  STEVE KROSCHEL: Antes de volver a Alaska, Garrett quer\u00eda \nconocer a una \u00faltima persona.  \n02:21:37:11  Su nombre es Jay Kordich.  \n02:21:39:17  Conocido por millones como el \u201chombre del jugo\u201d, Jay ha \nvendido cerca de 1.000 millones de d\u00f3lares en extractores de \njugo e n todo el mundo.  \n02:21:48:23  JAY KORDICH: Bueno Garrett, tu sabes, he estado haciendo \nesto desde 1948, desde que tuve c\u00e1ncer de vejiga.  \n02:21:54:22  Recuerdo que despu\u00e9s de jugar f\u00fatbol para la Universidad del \nSur de California, fui reclutado por Curly La mbeau y su \nequipo\u201cGreen BayPackers\u201d  \n02:22:05:09  Y entonces mi problema urinario empez\u00f3.  \n02:22:07:16  Empec\u00e9 a orinar sangre, y me enter\u00e9 que ten\u00eda un tumor en la \nvejiga, y record\u00e9 de una de las clases que tuve en fisiolog\u00eda, \nsobre anatom\u00eda humana, cuando le\u00ed algo sobre el tratamiento \nque el Dr. Max Gerson le hab\u00eda hecho al Dr. Albert \nSchweitzer.  \n02:22:25:22  Y dije Dios m\u00edo, despu\u00e9s de enterarme de que ten\u00eda c\u00e1ncer de \nvejiga, si este tratamiento funcion\u00f3 para el Dr. Albert \nSchweitzer, seguro que funcionar\u00ed a para m\u00ed.  \n02:22:37:17  JAY KORDICH: Nunca pens\u00e9 que tanto saldr\u00eda de esto.  \n02:22:41:10  JAY KORDICH: \u00c9ste, \u00e9ste es el jugo que salv\u00f3 mi vida \ncuando tuve c\u00e1ncer de vejiga.  \n02:22:49:03  El tratamiento Gerson: zanahoria y manzana.  \n02:22:54:22  JAY KORDICH: G racias a eso, estoy aqu\u00ed.  \n02:22:57:06  Todas las bebidas que hice y a\u00fan sigo haciendo, \u00bfy desde \ncu\u00e1ndo?

 \n02:24:48:02  STEVE KROSCHEL: El chico a\u00fan cree que hay esperanza.  \n02:24:50:09  Cree que tiene un futuro.  \n02:24:52:19  Cree que los problemas ambientales que la humanidad enfrenta \nse convertir\u00e1n  en soluciones colectivas.  \n02:24:58:20  Despu\u00e9s de todo, este es nuestro \u00fanico hogar y somos seres \nhumanos racionales.   \nThe Beautiful Truth  \n162 \n 02:25:45:24  STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett no ve\u00eda la hora de brindarle un \njugo fresco de zanahoria a su vecino John.  \n02:26:54:02  BOB: Me gust ar\u00eda ver alguna prueba cient\u00edfica.  \n02:26:56:13  STEVE KROSCHEL: A nuestro otro vecino, Bob, el que \norde\u00f1a las cabras y que era esc\u00e9ptico, le gustaba mucho lo que \nestaba oyendo.  \n02:27:03:06  Y a su esposa tambi\u00e9n, hasta que\u2026  \n02:27:05:06  GARRETT: Bueno, pon  tres cucharadas de caf\u00e9 en agua \nhirviendo.  \n02:27:11:00  Luego d\u00e9jalo hervir a fuego lento por 12 minutos.  \n02:27:14:27  Y ponlo en una jarra de un litro y a\u00f1\u00e1dele agua hasta completar \nel litro.  \n02:27:20:28  Luego, se debe conectar el tubo al ano y dejar q ue el caf\u00e9 entre \npor \u00e9ste.  \n02:27:28:27  Despu\u00e9s, esperas por 12 minutos, y finalmente vas al ba\u00f1o a \nevacuar.  \n02:28:07:09  STEVE KROSCHEL: A cada uno de nosotros, estemos listos o \nno, alg\u00fan d\u00eda nos llegar\u00e1 la hora de partir.  \n02:28:15:09  No habr\u00e1n m\u00e1s amane ceres, ni minutos, ni horas, ni dias.  \n02:28:20:20  Todas las cosas que reuniste, ya sean valiosas o sin \nimportancia, pasar\u00e1n a manos de otra persona.  \n02:28:27:06  Tu riqueza, fama y poder temporal se volver\u00e1n irrelevantes.  \n02:28:32:25  No importar\u00e1 lo que t en\u00edas o lo que deb\u00edas.  \n02:28:36:22  Tus rencores, resentimientos, frustraciones y celos finalmente \ndesaparecer\u00e1n.  \n02:28:44:01  Al igual que tus esperanzas, ambiciones, planes y tareas por \nhacer.  \n02:28:51:15  Las victorias y fracasos que antes parec\u00edan ser tan importantes \nse desvanecer\u00e1n.  \n02:28:56:18  Al final, no importar\u00e1 de donde viniste o la forma en que \nviviste.  \n02:29:02:18  No importar\u00e1 si eres hermoso o brillante.  \n02:29:05:23  Incluso tu g\u00e9nero y color de piel ser\u00e1n irrelevantes.  \n02:29:09:29  Entonces , \u00bfqu\u00e9 importar\u00e1?
