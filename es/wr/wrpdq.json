Soil from the surroundings of the mine El Bote in Zacatecas, Mexico, was analyzed, and the zeolite was characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and nitrogen physisorption. An ammonium-exchange method for the zeolite was employed. Leaching experiments using packed columns with polluted soil and zeolite mixtures were carried out and the effect of the pH of the carrier solutions was studied. Incorporation of zeolite in the soil achieved a beneficial increase in pH, from 5.03 to 6.95. The concentration of Cd and Mn was reduced when zeolite was present in the column and the ammonium-modified zeolite with ammonia also enhanced the concentration reduction of metallic species in leachates in a range of 28 to 68%. The first-order model best fits the experimental data, suggesting that the leaching rate is controlled by concentration difference between the liquid and the soil matrix. These results demonstrate the potential for using natural zeolite clinoptilolite to reduce the leaching rate of potentially toxic elements in soil from mine tailings.\nAB - The use of natural zeolite clinoptilolite to reduce the leaching rate of potentially toxic elements such as Cd, Pb, and Mn in soil from mine tailings was studied.
