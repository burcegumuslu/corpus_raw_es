Students should know that scientific theories, unlike hypotheses, are well-established and highly re liable, but they may still be subject to change \nas new information and technologies are developed. Students should be able to distinguish between scientific decision-making methods an d ethical/social decisions that involve the \napplication of scientific information. \n(3) \tGrade 6 science is interdisciplinary in natu re; however, much of the content focus is on \nphysical science. National standards in science are organized as multi-grade blocks such as \nGrades 5-8 rather than individual grade levels. In order to follow the grade level format used in Texas, the various national standa rds are found among Grades 6, 7, and 8. \nRecurring themes are pervasive in sciences, mathematics, and technology. These ideas transcend disciplinary boundaries and include change and constancy, patterns, cycles, systems, models, and scale. \n(4) \tThe strands for Grade 6 include: \n(A) \t Scientific investigations and reasoning. \n(i) \t To develop a rich knowledge of science and the natural world, students must \nbecome familiar with different modes of scientific inquiry, rules of evidence, \nways of formulating questions, ways of proposing explanations, and the diverse ways scientists study the natural world and propose explanations based on evidence derived from their work. \n(ii) \t Scientific investigations are conducte d for different reasons. All investigations \nrequire a research question, careful observations, data gathering, and analysis of the data to identify the patterns that  will explain the findings. Descriptive \ninvestigations are used to explore new phenomena such as conducting surveys of organisms or measuring the abiotic com ponents in a given habitat. Descriptive \nstatistics include frequency, range, mean, median, and mode. A hypothesis is not required in a descriptive investigation. On the other hand, when conditions can be controlled in order to focus on a single variable, experimental research design is used to determine causation. Stud ents should experience both types of \ninvestigations and understand that differe nt scientific research questions require \ndifferent research designs. \n(iii) \t Scientific investigations are used to  learn about the natural world. Students \nshould understand that certain types of questions can be answered by \nProclamation 2014\t Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills 35  \n    \n investigations, and the methods, mode ls, and conclusions built from these \ninvestigations change as new observations are made. Models of objects and \nevents are tools for understanding the natural world and can show how systems work. Models have limitations and based on new discoveries are constantly being modified to more closely reflect the natural world. \n(B) \t Matter and energy. \n(i) \t Matter can be classified as elements, compounds, or mixtures. Students have \nalready had experience with mixtures in Grade 5, so Grade 6 will concentrate on \ndeveloping an understanding of elements  and compounds. It is important that \nstudents learn the differences between elements and compounds based on observations, description of physical properties, and chemical reactions. Elements are represented by chemical symbols, while compounds are represented by chemical formulas. Subsequent grades will learn about the differences at the molecular and atomic level. \n(ii) \t Elements are classified as metals, nonmetals, and metalloids based on their \nphysical properties. The elements are divi ded into three groups on the Periodic \nTable. Each different substance usually has a different density, so density can be \nused as an identifying property. Therefore,  calculating density aids classification \nof substances. \n(iii) \t Energy resources are available on a ren ewable, nonrenewable, or indefinite basis. \nUnderstanding the origins and uses of these resources enables informed decision making. Students should consider the et hical/social issues surrounding Earth's \nnatural energy resources, while looking at the advantages and disadvantages of their long-term uses. \n(C) \t Force, motion, and energy. Energy occurs in two types, potential and kinetic, and \ncan take several forms. Thermal energy  can be transferred by conduction, \nconvection, or radiation. It can also be changed from one form to another. Students will investigate the relationship between fo rce and motion using a variety of means, \nincluding calculations and measurements. \n(D) \t Earth and space. The focus of this strand is on introducing Earth's processes. \nStudents should develop an understanding of Earth as part of our solar system. The topics include organization of our solar system, the role of gravity, and space \nexploration. \n(E) \t Organisms and environments. Students w ill gain an understanding of the broadest \ntaxonomic classifications of organisms and how characteristics determine their \nclassification.

Science, Grade 7, Beginning with School Year 2010-2011. \n(a) \tIntroduction. \n(1) \tScience, as defined by the National Academ y of Sciences, is the \"use of evidence to \nconstruct testable explanations and predicti ons of natural phenomena, as well as the \nknowledge generated through this process.\" This vast body of changing and increasing \nknowledge is described by physical, mathematical, and conceptual models. Students should know that some questions are outside the realm of science because they deal with \nphenomena that are not scientifically testable. \n(2) \tScientific hypotheses are tentative and testabl e statements that must be capable of being \nsupported or not supported by observational evidence. Hypotheses of durable explanatory power that have been tested over a wide variety of conditions become theories. Scientific theories are based on natural and physical phe nomena and are capable of being tested by \nmultiple, independent researchers. Students should know that scientific theories, unlike hypotheses, are well-established and highly re liable, but they may still be subject to change \nas new information and technologies are developed. Students should be able to distinguish between scientific decision-making methods an d ethical/social decisions that involve the \napplication of scientific information. \nProclamation 2014\t Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills 39  \n    (3) \tGrade 7 science is interdisciplinary in natu re; however, much of the content focus is on \norganisms and the environment. National standards in science are organized as a multi\u00ad\ngrade blocks such as Grades 5-8 rather than individual grade levels. In order to follow the grade level format used in Texas, the various national standards are found among Grades 6, 7, and 8.

Descriptive \ninvestigations are used to explore new phenomena such as conducting surveys of organisms or measuring the abiotic com ponents in a given habitat. Descriptive \nstatistics include frequency, range, mean, median, and mode. A hypothesis is not required in a descriptive investigation. On the other hand, when conditions can be controlled in order to focus on a single variable, experimental research design is used to determine causation. Stud ents should experience both types of \ninvestigations and understand that differe nt scientific research questions require \ndifferent research designs. \n(iii) \t Scientific investigations are used to  learn about the natural world. Students \nshould understand that certain types of questions can be answered by investigations, and the methods, mode ls, and conclusions built from these \ninvestigations change as new observations are made. Models of objects and events are tools for understanding the natural world and can show how systems work. Models have limitations and based on new discoveries are constantly being modified to more closely reflect the natural world. \n(B) \t Matter and energy. Matter and energy are conserved throughout living systems. \nRadiant energy from the Sun drives much of the flow of energy throughout living systems due to the process of photosynthesis  in organisms described as producers. \nMost consumers then depend on producers to meet their energy needs. Decomposers play an important role in recycling matter. Organic compounds are composed of carbon and other elements th at are recycled due to chemical changes \nthat rearrange the elements for the particular needs of that living system. Large molecules such as carbohydrates are composed of chains of smaller units such as sugars, similar to a train being composed of multiple box cars. Subsequent grade levels will learn about the differences at the molecular and atomic level. \n(C) \t Force, motion, and energy. Force, motion,  and energy are observed in living systems \nand the environment in several ways. In teractions between muscular and skeletal \nsystems allow the body to apply forces and transform energy both internally and externally. Force and motion can also describe the direction and growth of seedlings, turgor pressure, and geotropism. Catastr ophic events of weather systems such as \nTexas Essential Knowledge and Skills\t Proclamation 2014 40  \n    \n hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes can shape and restructure the environment \nthrough the force and motion evident in them. Weathering, erosion, and deposition occur in environments due to the forces of gravity, wind, ice, and water. \n(D) \t Earth and space. Earth and space phenomena can be observed in a variety of \nsettings. Both natural events and human a ctivities can impact Earth systems. There \nare characteristics of Earth and relationships to objects in our solar system that allow life to exist. \n(E) \t Organisms and environments. \n(i) \t Students will understand the relationship between living organisms and their \nenvironment. Different environments support different living organisms that are adapted to that region of Earth. Organisms are living systems that maintain a steady state with that environment an d whose balance may be disrupted by \ninternal and external stimuli. External stimuli include human activity or the \nenvironment. Successful organisms can r eestablish a balance through different \nprocesses such as a feedback mechanism. Ecological succession can be seen on a \nbroad or small scale. \n(ii) \t Students learn that all organisms obtain energy, get rid of wastes, grow, and \nreproduce. During both sexual and asexual reproduction, traits are passed onto the next generation. These traits are contained in genetic material that is found on genes within a chromosome from the parent. Changes in traits sometimes occur in a population over many generations. One of the ways a change can occur is through the process of natural selection. Students extend their understanding of structures in living systems from a previous focus on external structures to an understanding of internal structures and functions within living things. \n(iii) \t All living organisms are made up of sm aller units called cells. All cells use energy, \nget rid of wastes, and contain genetic ma terial. Students will compare plant and \nanimal cells and understand the internal structures within them that allow them to obtain energy, get rid of wastes, grow, and reproduce in different ways. Cells can organize into tissues, tissues into organs, and organs into organ systems. Students will learn the major functions of human body systems such as the ability of the integumentary system to protect against infection, injury, and ultraviolet \n(UV) radiation; regulate body temperature; and remove waste. \n(b) Knowledge and skills. \n(1) \tScientific investigation and reasoning.

ESS is a caps tone course designed to build on students' \nprior scientific and academic knowledge and skills to develop understanding of Earth's \nsystem in space and time. \n(2) \tNature of science. Science, as defined by th e National Academy of Sciences, is the \"use of \nevidence to construct testable explanations an d predictions of natural phenomena, as well \nas the knowledge generated through this process.\" This vast body of changing and \nincreasing knowledge is described by physi cal, mathematical, and conceptual models. \nStudents should know that some questions are outside the realm of science because they deal with phenomena that are not scientifically testable. \n(3) \tScientific inquiry. Scientific inquiry is the planned and deliberate investigation of the \nnatural world. Scientific methods of investig ation can be experimental, descriptive, or \ncomparative. The method chosen should be appropriate to the question being asked. \n(4) \tScience and social ethics. Scientific decisi on making is a way of answering questions about \nthe natural world. Students should be able to distinguish between scientific decision-making methods and ethical and social decisions that involve the application of scientific information. \n(5) \tESS themes. An Earth systems approach to the themes of Earth in space and time, solid \nEarth, and fluid Earth defined the selection an d development of the concepts described in \nthis paragraph. \n(A) \t Earth in space and time. Earth has a long, complex, and dynamic history. Advances \nin technologies continue to further our understanding of the origin, evolution, and properties of Earth and planetary system s within a chronological framework. The \norigin and distribution of resources that sustain life on Earth are the result of interactions among Earth's subsystems over billions of years. \n(B) \t Solid Earth. The geosphere is a collection of complex, interacting, dynamic \nsubsystems linking Earth's interior to its surface. The geosphere is composed of materials that move between subsystems at various rates driven by the uneven distribution of thermal energy. These dy namic processes are responsible for the \norigin and distribution of resources as well as geologic hazards that impact society. \nTexas Essential Knowledge and Skills\t Proclamation 2014 66  \n    \n (C) \t Fluid Earth. The fluid Earth consists of the hydrosphere, cryosphere, and \natmosphere subsystems. These subsystems interact with the biosphere and \ngeosphere resulting in complex biogeochemical and geochemical cycles. The global ocean is the thermal energy reservoir for surface processes and, through interactions \nwith the atmosphere, influences climate. Understanding these interactions and cycles over time has implications for life on Earth. \n(6) \tEarth and space science strands. ESS has three strands used throughout each of the three \nthemes: systems, energy, and relevance. \n(A) \t Systems. A system is a collection of inter acting physical, chemical, and biological \nprocesses that involves the flow of matter and energy on different temporal and spatial scales. Earth's system is composed of interdependent and interacting subsystems of the geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere \nwithin a larger planetary and stellar sys tem. Change and constancy occur in Earth's \nsystem and can be observed, measured as patterns and cycles, and described or presented in models used to predict ho w Earth's system changes over time. \n(B) \t Energy. The uneven distribution of Eart h's internal and external thermal energy is \nthe driving force for complex, dynamic, and continuous interactions and cycles in Earth's subsystems. These interactions are responsible for the movement of matter within and between the subsystems resulting  in, for example, plate motions and \nocean-atmosphere circulation. \n(C) \t Relevance. The interacting components of  Earth's system change by both natural \nand human-influenced processes. Natural processes include hazards such as flooding, earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricane s, meteorite impacts, and climate change. \nSome human-influenced processes such as pollution and nonsustainable use of Earth's natural resources may damage Earth's system. Examples include climate change, soil erosion, air and water pollution,  and biodiversity loss. The time scale of \nthese changes and their impact on human society must be understood to make wise decisions concerning the use of the land, water, air, and natural resources. Proper stewardship of Earth will prevent unnecessary degradation and destruction of Earth's subsystems and diminish detrimental impacts to individuals and society. \n(c) \tKnowledge and skills. \n(1) \tScientific processes.

Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for \nCareeer and Technical Education  \nSubchapter A. Agriculture, Food, and Natural Resources \n\u00a7130.7. Advanced Animal Science. \n(a) \tGeneral requirements. This course is recommended for students in Grade 12. Recommended \nprerequisite: a minimum of one credit from the courses in the Agriculture, Food, and Natural \nResources cluster. To receive credit in scien ce, students must meet the 40% laboratory and \nfieldwork requirement identified in \u00a774.3(b)(2)(C ) of this title (relatin g to Description of a \nRequired Secondary Curriculum). \n(b) Introduction. \n(1) \tAdvanced Animal Science. To be prepared for careers in the field of animal science, \nstudents need to attain academic skills and knowledge, acquire knowledge and skills related \nto animal systems, and develop knowledge an d skills regarding career opportunities, entry \nrequirements, and industry standards. To prepare for success, students need opportunities \nto learn, reinforce, apply, and transfer their knowledge and skills in a variety of settings. This course examines the interrelatedness of human, scientific, and technological dimensions of livestock production. Instruction is designed to allow for the application of scientific and technological aspects of an imal science through field and laboratory \nexperiences. \n(2) \tNature of science. Science, as defined by th e National Academy of Sciences, is the \"use of \nevidence to construct testable explanations an d predictions of natural phenomena, as well \nas the knowledge generated through this process.\" This vast body of changing and increasing knowledge is described by physi cal, mathematical, and conceptual models. \nStudents should know that some questions are outside the realm of science because they deal with phenomena that are not scientifically testable. \n(3) \tScientific inquiry. Scientific inquiry is the planned and deliberate investigation of the \nnatural world. Scientific methods of invest igation are experimental, descriptive, or \ncomparative. The method chosen should be appropriate to the question being asked. \n(4) \tScience and social ethics. Scientific decisi on making is a way of answering questions about \nthe natural world. Students should be able to distinguish between scientific decision-making methods (scientific methods) and ethical  and social decisions that involve science \n(the application of scientific information). \n(5) \tScience, systems, and models. A system is a collection of cycles, structures, and processes \nthat interact. All systems have basic properties that can be described in space, time, energy, \nand matter. Change and constancy occur in systems as patterns and can be observed, measured, and modeled. These patterns help to make predictions that can be scientifically \ntested. Students should analyze a system in terms of its components and how these \ncomponents relate to each other, to the whole, and to the external environment. \n(c) \tKnowledge and skills. \n(1) \tThe student, for at least 40% of inst ructional time, conducts field and laboratory \ninvestigations using safe, environmentally  appropriate, and ethical practices.

English Language Proficiency Standards. \n(a) \tIntroduction. \n(1) \tThe English language proficiency standard s in this section outline English language \nproficiency level descriptors and student ex pectations for English language learners \n(ELLs). School districts shall implement this section as an integral part of each subject in \nthe required curriculum. The English language proficiency standards are to be published \nalong with the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) for each subject in the required curriculum. \n(2) \tIn order for ELLs to be successful, they m ust acquire both social and academic language \nproficiency in English. Social language prof iciency in English consists of the English \nneeded for daily social interactions. Academic language proficiency consists of the English needed to think critically, understand and learn new concepts, process complex academic \nmaterial, and interact and communicate in English academic settings. \n(3) \tClassroom instruction that effectively integrates second language acquisition with quality \ncontent area instruction ensures that ELLs  acquire social and academic language \nproficiency in English, learn the knowledge and skills in the TEKS, and reach their full academic potential. \n(4) \tEffective instruction in second language acquisition involves giving ELLs opportunities to \nlisten, speak, read, and write at their current levels of English development while gradually \nincreasing the linguistic complexity of the En glish they read and hear, and are expected to \nspeak and write. \n(5) \tThe cross-curricular second language acquisition skills in subsection (c) of this section \napply to ELLs in Kindergarten-Grade 12. \n(6) \tThe English language proficiency levels  of beginning, intermediate, advanced, and \nadvanced high are not grade-specific. ELLs ma y exhibit different proficiency levels within \nthe language domains of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The proficiency level \ndescriptors outlined in subsection (d) of th is section show the progression of second \nlanguage acquisition from one proficiency level to  the next and serve as a road map to help \ncontent area teachers instruct ELLs commen surate with students' linguistic needs. \n(b) School district responsibilities. In fulfilling th e requirements of this section, school districts \nshall: \n(1) \tidentify the student's English language pr oficiency levels in the domains of listening, \nspeaking, reading, and writing in accordance wi th the proficiency level descriptors for the \nbeginning, intermediate, advanced, and advanced high levels delineated in subsection (d) of \nthis section; \n(2) \tprovide instruction in the knowledge an d skills of the foundation and enrichment \ncurriculum in a manner that is linguistically accommodated (communicated, sequenced, \nand scaffolded) commensurate with the student's levels of English language proficiency to \nensure that the student learns the knowledge and skills in the required curriculum; \nProclamation 2014\t English Language Proficiency Standards 277  \n    \n \n \n (3) \tprovide content-based instruction including the cross-curricular second language \nacquisition essential knowledge and skills in subsection (c) of this section in a manner that \nis linguistically accommodated to help the st udent acquire English language proficiency; \nand \n(4) \tprovide intensive and ongoing foundational second language acquisition instruction to \nELLs in Grade 3 or higher who are at the beginning or intermediate level of English \nlanguage proficiency in listening, speaking, reading, and/or writing as determined by the \nstate's English language proficiency assessm ent system.

In order for the ELL to meet grade-level \nlearning expectations across foundation and enrichment curriculum, all instruction delivered in English must be linguistically accommodated (communicated, sequenced, and scaffolded) commensurate with the student's le vel of English language proficiency. For \nKindergarten and Grade 1, certain of these student expectations do not apply until the \nstudent has reached the stage of generating or iginal written text using a standard writing \nsystem. The student is expected to: \n(A) \t learn relationships between sounds and l etters of the English language to represent \nsounds when writing in English; \n(B) \t write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and content-based grade-level \nvocabulary; \n(C) \t spell familiar English words with increasing accuracy, and employ English spelling \npatterns and rules with increasing a ccuracy as more English is acquired; \n(D) \t edit writing for standard grammar an d usage, including subject-verb agreement, \npronoun agreement, and appropriate verb tenses commensurate with grade-level \nexpectations as more English is acquired; \n(E) \t employ increasingly complex grammatical structures in content area writing \ncommensurate with grade-level expectations, such as: \n(i) \t using correct verbs, tenses, and pronouns/antecedents; \n(ii) \t using possessive case (apostrophe s) correctly; and \n(iii) \t using negatives and contractions correctly; \n(F) \t write using a variety of grade-appropriate sentence lengths, patt erns, and connecting \nwords to combine phrases, clauses, and sentences in increasingly accurate ways as more English is acquired; and \n(G) \t narrate, describe, and explain with increasi ng specificity and detail to fulfill content \narea writing needs as more English is acquired. \n(d) \tProficiency level descriptors. \n(1) \tListening, Kindergarten-Grade 12. ELLs may be at the beginning, intermediate, advanced, \nor advanced high stage of English language acquisition in listening. The following proficiency level descriptors for listening are sufficient to describe the overall English \nlanguage proficiency levels of ELLs in this  language domain in order to linguistically \naccommodate their instruction. \n(A) \t Beginning. Beginning ELLs have little or no ability to understand spoken English in \nacademic and social settings. These students: \n(i) \t struggle to understand simple conversations and simple discussions even when \nthe topics are familiar and the speaker uses linguistic supports such as visuals, slower speech and other verbal cues, and gestures; \nProclamation 2014\t English Language Proficiency Standards 281  \n    \n \n   \n \n \n  (ii) \t struggle to identify and distinguish in dividual words and phrases during social \nand instructional interactions that have not been intentionally modified for \nELLs; and \n(iii) \t may not seek clarification in English when failing to comprehend the English \nthey hear; frequently remain silent, watching others for cues. \n(B) \t Intermediate.

These \nstudents: \n(i) \t usually understand simple or routine directions, as well as short, simple \nconversations and short, simple discussi ons on familiar topics; when topics are \nunfamiliar, require extensive linguistic supports and adaptations such as visuals, slower speech and other verbal cues, simplified language, gestures, and \npreteaching to preview or build topic-related vocabulary; \n(ii) \t often identify and distinguish key words and phrases necessary to understand the \ngeneral meaning during social and basic instructional interactions that have not been intentionally modified for ELLs; and \n(iii) \t have the ability to seek clarification in English when failing to comprehend the \nEnglish they hear by requiring/requesting the speaker to repeat, slow down, or \nrephrase speech. \n(C) \t Advanced. Advanced ELLs have the ability to understand, with second language \nacquisition support, grade-appropriate spoken  English used in academic and social \nsettings. These students: \n(i) \t usually understand longer, more elaborated directions, conversations, and \ndiscussions on familiar and some unfamiliar topics, but sometimes need processing time and sometimes depend on visuals, verbal cues, and gestures to support understanding; \n(ii) \t understand most main points, most  important details, and some implicit \ninformation during social and basic inst ructional interactions that have not been \nintentionally modified for ELLs; and \n(iii) \t occasionally require/request the speake r to repeat, slow down, or rephrase to \nclarify the meaning of the English they hear. \n(D) \t Advanced high. Advanced high ELLs have the ability to understand, with minimal \nsecond language acquisition support, grad e-appropriate spoken English used in \nacademic and social settings. These students: \n(i) \t understand longer, elaborated directions, conversations, and discussions on \nfamiliar and unfamiliar topics with occasi onal need for processing time and with \nlittle dependence on visuals, verbal cues, and gestures; some exceptions when complex academic or highly specialized language is used; \n(ii) \t understand main points, important de tails, and implicit information at a level \nnearly comparable to native English-speaking peers during social and instructional interactions; and \n(iii) \t rarely require/request th e speaker to repeat, slow down, or rephrase to clarify the \nmeaning of the English they hear. \nEnglish Language Proficiency Standards\t Proclamation 2014 282  \n    \n (2) \tSpeaking, Kindergarten-Grade 12.

Printed Instructional Materials \nElectronic Files and Instructiona l Materials Required For Automated \nProduction Of Braille \nUnder sections 712(a)(23)(A) and 674(e)(4) of th e Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, as amended b the Individuals with Disabilities Improvement Act of 2004, the Secretary \nof Education establishes the National Inst ructional Materials Accessibility Standard \n(NIMAS). Under Section 674(e)(4) of the Act, NIMAS files of printed instructional materials are needed to ensure the timely production of braille versions of the materials. \nEvery publisher of print materials adopted under Proclamation 2014 must provide electronic files of their adopted programs to facilitate the production of braille versions. The electronic files must conform to the NIMAS, the purpose of which is to help increase the availability and timely delivery of print instructional mater ials in accessible formats to blind or other \npersons with print disabilities in elementary and secondary schools. The NIMAS 1.1 The Technical Standard (Annotated)  can be found at \nhttp://aim.cast.org/experience/technologies/spec-v1_1 . \nNew publishers should email nimac@aph.org to request a publisher account. The National \nInstructional Materials Access Center (NIMAC) will provide instructions regarding how to set up an account, as well as complete documentation regarding submission procedures and how to prepare metadata correctly. A new pub lisher may be required to provide a sample \nNIMAS file to the NIMAC for review before they establish an account for the publisher. Specific information and resources for publishers, including a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ), can be found at the NIMAC web site: http://www.nimac.us/publishers.html . \nAccessibility Information Proclamation 2014 A-8  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Additionally, publishers of electronic instructional materials adopted under Proclamation 2014 \nare required to offer these programs in an acce ssible format in accordance with the technical \nstandards of the Federal Rehabilitation Act, Sect ion 508.  Additional information is available \non the Section 508 website http://www.Section508.gov . Please refer to Section I. Electronic \nInstructional Materials . The portion of specifications entitled \u201cAccessibility Information \nResources for Publishers of Electronic Instru ctional Materials\u201d has been updated to show \nthe latest versions of publications related to the development of accessible electronic \ninstructional materials. \nComputer files and printed instructional materials are required for all subjects for automated \nbraille instructional materials produced under Proclamation 2014.  However, computer files are not required for Kindergarten instructional ma terials as the content is too pictorial for \nproducing in a braille format. \nEach publisher participating in Proclamation 20 14 is required to provide the name, address, \ntelephone number, fax number and e-mail addr ess of the individual responsible for \nproviding the computerized files, normally the instructional materials production manager, \nby September 13, 2013. Communication between the Division of Instructional Materials \nand Educational Technology and the publisher's representative responsible for providing the \ncomputerized files should begin early in the file production process. Publishers will send a small test file and associated print pages to the Division of Instructional Materials and Educational Technology, Attention: Dist ribution and Accessibility Director by October 4, \n2013. Early detection of any problems in the test file will allow time for publishers and braille \nproducers to remedy these problems before the final delivery deadline. Also, publishers will be requested to submit three copies of the designated print student materials and one copy of the computerized files to be used in production of Braille versions.  Publishers should \nprovide computerized files of blackline ma sters or other materials clearly intended \nfor student use even though they a re included in the teacher component . Printed \nstudent materials and computer files must be  received by the Instructional Materials and \nEducational Technology Division no later than December 6, 2013. \nPublishers are required to submit three pint copies and NIMAS files of student components \nadopted in Proclamation 2014 that incorporate all required corrections. Corrected student components and NIMAS files must be received no later than May 2, 2014 . \nProcedures For Providing Electronic Files And Printed Materials To Braille, Large-Type, and Audio Producers \n(1)\t September 13, 2013: Publishers provide to the Instructional Materials and Educational \nTechnology Division the name, address, an d telephone number of the production \nmanager of each printed textbook or instructional material being prepared for submission. This information should be sent to Ms. Kelly Griffin, at e-mail address: \nkelly.griffin@tea.state.tx.us , fax number (512) 463-8278, or regular address: 1701 North \nCongress Avenue, Room 3-110,  Austin, Texas 78701. \nProclamation 2014 \t Accessibility Information A-9  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  (2)\t October 4, 2013 : Publishers send a small NIMAS test file and associated print pages to \nthe Instructional Materials and Educational Technology Division, Attention: \nDistribution and Accessibility Director. In th e past, this procedure has proven to be \nextremely beneficial to publishers and braille  producers. It has significantly facilitated \ncommunication between publishers and braille  producers. After receipt of the NIMAS \ntest files, braille producers designated by the Agency will need at least two weeks to \nevaluate the files and respond to publisher inquiries about usability.  \n(3)\t Week Following November SBOE Meeting : Publishers of adopted printed \ninstructional materials are informed of the designated braille producers by Instructional Materials and Educational Technology Division. \n(4)\t December 6, 2013 : \n(a) Publishers must provide three print copies of the adopted student materials, \none copy of the digital files and a screen  shot from the publisher\u2019s copy of the \nNIMAC Validation Wizard showing that the file has successfully passed validation with \u201c0 errors, 0 warnings\u201d for both the XML file and OPF file to \nthe designated braille producer. \nPublishers are not required to provide printed copies or computer files of \nmaterials that are designed for use by teachers. If a teacher who is visually impaired requires a braille version during the adoption period, a publisher will be requested to provide the agency with two printed teacher editions, if applicable. Publishers should provide two print copies and computerized \nfiles of blackline masters or other materials clearly intended for student \nuse even though they are incl uded in the teacher component. \n(b) Deliver usable textbook NIMAS files to designated Braille producers in \naccordance with the enclosed NIMAS standards. \n(c) Publishers must provide one print copy of the adopted student materials to the \ndesignated large-print producer; publishe rs must provide one print copy of the \nadopted student materials to the designated audio producer. \n(5)\t May 2, 2014: \n(a) Submit three print copies of the corrected student components and corrected \nNIMAS files to the designated Braille producer.  \n(b) Publishers must submit corrected NIMAS files to the NIMAC.\t  The Texas \nEducation Agency (TEA) and the NIMAC will coordinate to ensure that the \nfile is uploaded to the NIMAC \nA-10\t Accessibility Information Proclamation 2014  \n \n    NIMAS 1.1 Technical Specifications \nThe NIMAS 1.1 technical specification can be found at \nhttp://aim.cast.org/experience/technologies/spec-v1_1 \nProclamation 2014 Accessibility Information A-11 ", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
