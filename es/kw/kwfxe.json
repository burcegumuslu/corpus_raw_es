This formula promotes the genes that favor youthful, healthy cells, and is believed to help balance blood sugar. It contains a stabilized form of oxaloacetic acid, which is the world\u2019s first compound to maximize the Krebs cycle, the process by which the body uses stored energy. benaGene\u2122 is a perfect partner for resveratrol supplementation.\nbenaGene\u2122 increases conversion of the cellular factor of NADH to its oxidized form, NAD. NAD is a niacin-derived coenzyme that is present in all living cells and is critical to the production of ATP, the body\u2019s source of immediate energy. In short, NAD helps increase cellular energy and stimulates beneficial genes; NADH inhibits them. For many adults, a low-calorie diet is the chosen method for weight management, staying fit, and maintaining health. By definition, a low-calorie diet (also known as \u2018caloric restriction\u2019) is when a person limits their daily calorie intake while still getting a sufficient amount of vitamins, minerals and other important nutrients.\nAOR Advantage\nThrough a process similar to intermittent fasting, benaGene\u2122 mimics a low-calorie diet, resulting in up to 98% of the changes in the genetic expression of over 350 genes. By doing so, AOR\u2019s benaGene\u2122 helps support healthy weight management, which promotes vitality and healthy aging.\nbenaGene\u2122 with thermally stablilized oxaloacetate or 3-carboxy-3oxopropanoic acid, is a key intermediate in the Kreb\u2019s Cycle which is involved in cellular energy production.*\nAOR\u2122 guarantees that all ingredients have been declared on the label.
