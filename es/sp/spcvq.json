That never changes, as you may know.\nThis mod is actually a visual rework of a similar mission set in World War I, but it\u2019s really well done. Here you\u2019ll find modern weapons and a battle for an unexploded ballistic missile. You\u2019re going to see the enemy way after you hear them, and that has its own charm\u2026 that\u2019s complemented by the \u201ctoxic atmosphere\u201d of the map.\nFlooded Tunisia by Bazsi37\nAnother effective way to transform the familiar game location. New incarnation of Tunisia is almost completely covered with water, and the battles are for the remaining chunks of land.\nIn this mode you have 5 points set in completely different corners of the huge map. Islands, the upper floors of flooded cities, oil derricks left above the water. Enough boats that the author has located around the respawn zone will help to get to the targets, but it is worth taking care about the construction of rallying points, to avoid being left without transport at some point.\nThe mission is best suited for huge and very long battles.\nBig Battle of Volokolamsk by tommyZZM\nA large and pretty classic battle near Moscow, the author of which we fully appreciate for the support of his creation and original solutions.\nHere within one mission there is both capture points and destroying objects, opening battle zones, and the battle itself is built on a seamless map of the Battle for Moscow. Proper design and good balance.\nLaunch the Missions\nEvery one of you can create your own mission, as well as launch any mission from the portal. Here\u2019s a quick reminder how to launch one of these multiplayer missions.\n- Choose a mission you like on the\n[Enlisted sandbox](https://enlisted-sandbox.gaijin.net/feed/all/)portal and press COPY URL on its page.\n- In the game, open mode selection (above the START button) and choose \u201cCustom matches\u201d.\n- Press \u201cCreate Game\u201d -> \u201cMods\u201d and paste the URL you\u2019ve previously copied.\nNow you only need to customize the options, and you\u2019re good to go \u2014 your server is in the list. Tell your friends to come, wait for other players to join or play by yourself.\n[Discute en el foro](https://forum.enlisted.net/t/mods-digest-10-000-feet-above-the-ground/59117)", "language": null, "image": "https://enlisted.net/i/enl-opengraph.jpg", "pagetype": "website", "links": ["/es/", "/es/news/", "/es/about/", "/es/about/squads/", "/es/about/campaigns/", "/es/about/comics/", "/es/replays/", "https://twitter.com/EnlistedGame", "https://facebook.com/enlistedgame", "https://www.instagram.com/enlistedgame", "https://t.me/enlisted_official", "https://www.youtube.com/c/EnlistedOfficialchannel", "https://discord.gg/E7WhsqF", "https://forum.enlisted.net", "https://sandbox.enlisted.net", "/es/partnership", "/en/news/show/469-enlisted-roadmap-en", "https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=EnlistedSquads&order&partner=News&partner_val=wj5d8xt5", "https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=EnlistedGold&order&partner=News&partner_val=wj5d8xt5", "https://gaijin.merch38.com/collections/enlisted", "https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=Enlisted&partner=News&partner_val=wj5d8xt5", "https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=EnlistedSquads&order&partner=News&partner_val=wj5d8xt5", "https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=EnlistedGold&order&partner=News&partner_val=wj5d8xt5", "https://gaijin.merch38.com/collections/enlisted", "/es/play4free/#!/sign-up", "/es/play4free/#!/sign-up", "/es/", "/es/news/", "https://enlisted-sandbox.gaijin.net/post/71RFJp7vlnIG3HAT/", "https://enlisted-sandbox.gaijin.net/post/jm38crq1mso93S0u/", "https://enlisted-sandbox.gaijin.net/post/lIXaTtfV9x0bZT61/", "https://enlisted-sandbox.gaijin.net/feed/all/", "https://forum.enlisted.net/t/mods-digest-10-000-feet-above-the-ground/59117", "https://legal.gaijin.net/", "https://legal.gaijin.net/termsofservice", "https://legal.gaijin.net/privacypolicy", "/es/support/cookie", "https://support.gaijin.net/hc/en-us", "https://incubator.gaijin.net/", "https://www.facebook.com/darkfklow/"]}
