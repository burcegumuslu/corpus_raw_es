However, these items may contain toxic compounds that have an impact on public health. We will focus on the regulatory aspects and differences of these products marketed in the North American region (USA-Mexico-Canada) from government websites and selected literature. Mexico has an ancestral tradition of using plants for the treatment, improvement, and maintenance of human health as compared with Canada and the USA Currently, the use of herbal products in this region has a regulatory framework. The legal framework in these three countries is related to their history, idiosyncrasies, socio-economic and cultural aspects. Therefore, there are different public policies for herbal products consumed in the region. Mexico has a more specific classification of these products. In Canada, all herbal products are classified as natural health products and the safety and efficacy must be scientifically proven. In the USA, the development of botanical drugs is very recent. In particular, both herbal products classified as food supplements in Mexico and dietary supplements in the USA may have risks in both safety and efficacy.\nAB - Increased life expectancy and high costs of medicines and medical care have led to the use of herbal products.
