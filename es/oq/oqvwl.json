Material and methods A total of 420 samples were collected from the study area as follows: 140 topsoil samples (TS) (0\u201310 cm), 140 subsoil samples (SS) (10\u201320 cm), and 140 deep soil samples (DS) (150 cm). The soils were characterized, and the concentrations of Ba, Co, Cr, Mn, and Ni were analyzed by atomic absorption photospectrometry following aqua regia digestion. Correlations and principal component analysis combined with spatial analysis were implemented in order to distinguish the sources and their classification as geogenic or anthropogenic. Several simple and robust statistical methods were applied to datasets in order to explore their potential in the evaluation of a useful and robust background values. The degree of contamination along with the geoaccumulation index, enrichment factor, and contamination factor were also evaluated. Results and discussion The median concentrations obtained for various elements includes Ba 461 mg kg\u22121, Co 82.7 mg kg\u22121, Cr 134 mg kg\u22121, Mn 311 mg kg\u22121, and Ni 56.1 mg kg\u22121. In general, the concentrations of Ba, Co, Cr, Mn, and Ni decrease with depth. Correlations and principal component analysis suggest that Cr, Mn, and Ni are contributed by external sources. The spatial distribution of Cr, Mn, and Ni in TS displays a spatial pattern extending along industrial environments and emission sources. Conclusions The estimated background values determined with the iterative 2\u03c3-technique includes 536 mg kg\u22121 for Ba, 95.9 mg kg\u22121 for Co, 208 mg kg\u22121 for Cr, 464 mg kg\u22121 for Mn, and 90.5 mg kg\u22121 for Ni. The geochemical index, enrichment factor, and the contamination factor register a moderate to considerable contamination in some soil samples.\nIr a texto completo en Enlace:\n[https://doi.org/10.1007/s11368-017-1750-0](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11368-017-1750-0)", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["/", "/login", "#", "/", "/handle/25022009/5", "/handle/25022009/3175", "#", "/", "/handle/25022009/5", "/handle/25022009/3175", "/bitstream/handle/25022009/1625/Tume%2c%20Gonz%c3%a1lez%2c%20King%2c%20Cuiti%c3%b1o%2c%20Roca%2c%20Bech%20%28Distinguishing%20between...%29.pdf?sequence=6&isAllowed=y", "/handle/25022009/1625?show=full", "http://repositoriodigital.ucsc.cl/handle/25022009/1625", "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11368-017-1750-0", "/handle/25022009/3175", "http://www.sibucsc.cl", "http://www.ucsc.cl/", "/contact", "/feedback", "/htmlmap", null, "/community-list", "/browse?type=dateissued", "/browse?type=author", "/browse?type=title", "/browse?type=subject", null, "/handle/25022009/3175/browse?type=dateissued", "/handle/25022009/3175/browse?type=author", "/handle/25022009/3175/browse?type=title", "/handle/25022009/3175/browse?type=subject", "/login", "/handle/25022009/1625/statistics", "http://www.sibucsc.cl", "http://www.ucsc.cl/", "/contact", "/feedback", "/htmlmap"]}
