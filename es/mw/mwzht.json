Introducci\u00f3n  \nEl sector del envasado representa uno de los principales sectores en la \nindustria del pl\u00e1stico a nivel mundial y ha experimentado en los \u00faltimos \na\u00f1os un continuo crecimiento debido a la diversidad de productos y \naplicaciones que comprende. Los pl\u00e1sticos utilizados en envasado \nalimentario deben contribuir al mantenimiento de la  calidad y seguridad de \nlos alimentos desde su procesado hasta su consumo, incluyendo en este \nciclo el almacenamiento y el transporte. Para ello, los envases alimentarios \ndeben proporcionar protecci\u00f3n mec\u00e1nica, \u00f3ptica y t\u00e9rmica a los alimentos \nenvasados, a dem\u00e1s de preservarlos contra factores o condiciones de \ndegradaci\u00f3n, tales como microorganismos, ox\u00edgeno, humedad, \ncontaminantes qu\u00edmicos, radiaci\u00f3n y elevadas temperaturas.  \nLos pol\u00edmeros convencionales han sido tradicionalmente muy utilizados \nen este secto r, en especial los pol\u00edmeros termopl\u00e1sticos derivados del \npetr\u00f3leo cuya introducci\u00f3n se produjo en las d\u00e9cadas de 1950 y 1960. Su \nuso se extendi\u00f3 r\u00e1pidamente debido a su gran versatilidad que comprende \nun amplio abanico de propiedades que los hace adecuado s para \naplicaciones espec\u00edficas en el \u00e1mbito de la alimentaci\u00f3n. Entre dichas \npropiedades cabe destacar su alta disponibilidad a un coste relativamente \nbajo y su buen comportamiento f\u00edsico -qu\u00edmico en condiciones de tracci\u00f3n \ny resistencia al desgarro ; adem\u00e1 s de la buena barrera al ox\u00edgeno, vapor de \nagua, CO 2 y aromas que ofrecen, as\u00ed como la buena capacidad de \nprocesamiento.  \nSin embargo , estos pol\u00edmeros presentan el doble inconveniente de su \norigen no renovable y su baja capacidad de degradaci\u00f3n en condicion es \nnaturales, por lo que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os son cada vez m\u00e1s las voces que \nabogan por el uso de biopol\u00edmeros en sistemas de envasado, materiales \nResumen  \n~ 4 ~ \n que se caracterizan por su biodegradabilidad y su origen a partir de fuentes \nrenovables. Su desarrollo en las dos \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas los hace merecedores \nde ser considerados una alternativa v\u00e1lida para reducir significativamente \nel impacto medioambiental de los pl\u00e1sticos convencionales, considerando \nla problem\u00e1tica relacionada con su eliminaci\u00f3n, aliviando, a su vez,  la \ndependencia del petr\u00f3leo y otras fuentes no renovables. El uso de estos \nbiopol\u00edmeros, como pueden ser el poli(\u00e1cido l\u00e1ctico) (PLA) o el almid\u00f3n \ntermopl\u00e1stico (TPS), est\u00e1 cada vez m\u00e1s introduci\u00e9ndose en el cada vez \nm\u00e1s competitivo mercado del envase ali mentario.  \nPor otra parte, la idea de mejorar la calidad y ampliar la vida \u00fatil de los \nalimentos, mientras se mantienen sus propiedades organol\u00e9pticas y \nnutritivas , est\u00e1 generando un importante inter\u00e9s en el entorno cient\u00edfico y \nde la industria alimentaria.  De hecho, el concepto tradicional de envase \nalimentario que basa su funci\u00f3n en contener y preservar al alimento sin \nque se produzca ninguna interacci\u00f3n entre \u00e9ste y el material de envase, ha \nevolucionado con el fin de permitir interacciones entre ellos, a s\u00ed como con \nel medioambiente. Este nuevo concepto es el de envase activo, y se basa \nen favorecer el proceso de transferencia de masa e interacci\u00f3n entre los \nmateriales de envase y los alimentos. El objetivo principal de los sistemas \nde envasado activo es a largar la vida \u00fatil de los productos envasados, \nminimizando o suprimiendo los efectos negativos producidos por agentes \ndel entorno que producen los procesos de descomposici\u00f3n del alimento. \nEntre dichos procesos destacan la presencia de microorganismos y la s \noxidaciones de l\u00edpidos, que causan p\u00e9rdidas inaceptables en la calidad del \nalimento, haci\u00e9ndolo inviable para su consumo en un corto tiempo.  \nEl creciente inter\u00e9s por este tipo de envases y la demanda de los \nconsumidores en lo que se refiere a productos n aturales, seguros, frescos y \nde larga vida \u00fatil ha incrementado el estudio del uso de aditivos de origen \nResumen  \n~ 5 ~ \n natural, como extractos de plantas y aceites esenciales, en sistemas de \nenvasado. Estos productos se clasifican como \u201c Generally Recognized as Safe\u201d  \n(GRAS) por la \u201cFood and Drug Administration\u201d  (FDA) de Estados Unidos, \nas\u00ed como por la Legislaci\u00f3n Europea actual para materiales destinados a \nestar en contacto con alimentos.  \nLos aditivos naturales pueden ser obtenidos de diferentes fuentes, \nincluyendo planta s, animales, bacterias, algas u hongos, adem\u00e1s de \nsubproductos generados en la industria alimentaria como pueden ser, por \nejemplo, la c\u00e1scara de la almendra, deshechos de salvia o de cascara de \nnaranja.  \nLos aceites esenciales y sus principales compuestos constituyentes son \nalgunos de los agentes activos m\u00e1s estudiados para ser incorporados como \naditivos activos en formulaciones polim\u00e9ricas , sean estos de origen natural \no sint\u00e9tico, ya que son aditivos nat urales que provienen de fuentes \nrenovables, son f\u00e1ciles de obtener y presentan un elevado car\u00e1cter \nantimicrobiano y/o antioxidante. Entre ellos , destacan el  carvacrol (5 -\nisopropil -2-metilfenol) y timol (2 -isopropil -5-metilfenol, dos \nmonoterpenos fen\u00f3licos que se caracterizan por ser dos de los aditivos \nnaturales m\u00e1s estudiados debido a sus excelentes propiedades \nantioxidantes y antimicrobianas, descritas ampliamente en la literatura \ncient\u00edfica. Estas propiedades, que les confieren un amplio abanico de \nposib ilidades en el \u00e1rea de los materiales para envasado activo, se deben a \nla presencia de grupos hidroxilo, altamente reactivos, en su estructura. \nAmbos compuestos son is\u00f3meros obtenidos a partir de diferentes plantas \narom\u00e1ticas y aceites esenciales de la fam ilia de las Labiatae , incluyendo las \nespecies Origanum, Satureja, Thymbra, Thymus y  Corydothymus . \nPor otra parte, la aplicaci\u00f3n de los conceptos b\u00e1sicos de la nanotecnolog\u00eda \na la ciencia de materiales ha constituido una revoluci\u00f3n en los paradigmas \nResumen  \n~ 6 ~ \n de dich a ciencia, ya que se han desarrollado nuevos nanomateriales con \nresultados novedosos y sorprendentes. En el \u00e1rea del envasado de \nalimentos estos nanomateriales han supuesto un cambio considerable \ndebido a las nuevas propiedades y funciones que aportan, que  han hecho \nque el uso de nanocargas haya ganado importancia como aditivos en \nmateriales de envasado. Investigaciones recientes centradas en el uso de \nnanopart\u00edculas han permitido crear, entender, caracterizar y usar estos \nnanocompuestos debido a su acci\u00f3n en la mejora de algunas de sus \npropiedades clave tales como la resistencia mec\u00e1nica, propiedades de \nbarrera a gases o estabilidad t\u00e9rmica. Asimismo, un aspecto de alta \nrelevancia para este trabajo es que la adici\u00f3n de nanopart\u00edculas con \npropiedades antimic robianas y/o antioxidantes resulta en una \ncombinaci\u00f3n excelente con los aditivos activos para conseguir la m\u00e1xima \nprotecci\u00f3n en los alimentos envasados.  \nEl uso de nanomateriales en combinaci\u00f3n con sistemas de envasado \nactivo ha permitido mejorar la integri dad estructural y las propiedades de \nbarrera de las matrices polim\u00e9ricas debido a la adici\u00f3n de los \nnanomateriales (ya sea nanoarcillas o nanopart\u00edculas met\u00e1licas), as\u00ed como \nla mejora en el comportamiento antimicrobiano y/o antioxidante por la \nacci\u00f3n de lo s aditivos activos, como los aceites esenciales de or\u00e9gano o \nclavo o bien compuestos con actividad intr\u00ednseca como el timol, carvacrol, \ntocoferoles o hidroxitirosol. Las nanopart\u00edculas de cobre, zinc, titanio, oro \ny plata, as\u00ed como algunos de sus \u00f3xidos me t\u00e1licos, tambi\u00e9n han sido \npropuestas como aditivos activos con el fin de extender la vida \u00fatil de los \nalimentos y proporcionar estrategias innovadoras, aceptables y seguras \npara desarrollar nuevos nanocompuestos activos.  \nUna vez desarrollado el nanocompues to activo su efecto sobre el alimento \ndebe ser evaluado ya que depender\u00e1 de la actividad de cada aditivo y de \nResumen  \n~ 7 ~ \n sus propiedades, as\u00ed como del tipo de alimento considerado, su \ncomposici\u00f3n y contenidos en grasa y agua. Se ha indicado que los \nalimentos lip\u00eddico s tienden a oxidarse m\u00e1s f\u00e1cilmente que los acuosos, as\u00ed \ncomo que los alimentos procesados pueden tener una mayor tendencia a \nsufrir una contaminaci\u00f3n cruzada que conlleve al deterioro del producto. \nEn este sentido, el pol\u00edmero desempe\u00f1a el papel m\u00e1s impor tante en la \nacci\u00f3n de liberaci\u00f3n de los aditivos mediante el control de la difusi\u00f3n de \nlos componentes activos en el seno de la matriz polim\u00e9rica y la \ndistribuci\u00f3n homog\u00e9nea de las nanocargas en su estructura.  \nLa aplicaci\u00f3n de los sistemas de envasado acti vo, en especial aquellos que \ncomprenden el uso de nanocompuestos, debe ser evaluada de forma que \nse pueda determinar de forma inequ\u00edvoca la seguridad para el consumidor \nde estos materiales en contacto con alimentos, siempre considerando las \nnormativas inte rnacionales que limitan, proh\u00edben y/o autorizan el uso de \neste tipo de aditivos. En la actualidad , se est\u00e1n desarrollado un n\u00famero \nelevado de investigaciones para evaluar la posibilidad de desarrollo y \nutilizaci\u00f3n de nanocompuestos con propiedades activas mediante la \ncombinaci\u00f3n de diferentes tipos de nanocargas (nanoarcillas, \nnanocelulosas, nanopart\u00edculas de plata, etc.) con aditivos de origen natural \ncon propiedades antimicrobianas y/o antioxidantes en matrices \npolim\u00e9ricas. Los principales esfuerzos en el  desarrollo de estos materiales \nse han centrado en estudiar sus propiedades funcionales mediante el uso \nde m\u00e9todos de determinaci\u00f3n del comportamiento antimicrobiano y \nantioxidante, estudios de desintegraci\u00f3n, toxicol\u00f3gicos y de migraci\u00f3n.  \n \n \n \n \nResumen  \n~ 8 ~ \n 2. Objetivos  \nEl objetivo general de este trabajo es el desarrollo de nuevos sistemas \nactivos de envasado con capacidad de protecci\u00f3n de las caracter\u00edsticas \norganol\u00e9pticas y nutricionales de los alimentos y prolongada vida \u00fatil.  \nPara ello, en el presente trabajo se han de sarrollo dos l\u00edneas b\u00e1sicas de \ninvestigaci\u00f3n: (1) sistemas de envasado activo utilizando polipropileno \n(PP) como pol\u00edmero base en combinaci\u00f3n con timol y/o carvacrol; y (2) \nnanocompuestos activos utilizando PLA como matriz biodegradable en \ncombinaci\u00f3n con timol y dos tipos de nano -refuerzos comerciales, una \nnanoarcilla (Dellite\u00ae43B, D43B) y nanopart\u00edculas de plata (Ag -NPs).  \nPara satisfacer el objetivo principal del presente trabajo se han planteado \nuna serie de objetivos espec\u00edficos que se enumeran a contin uaci\u00f3n:  \ni. Desarrollo y caracterizaci\u00f3n de pel\u00edculas basadas en PP con \ncarvacrol y timol. Se han estudiado diferentes propiedades f\u00edsico -\nqu\u00edmicas de las pel\u00edculas activas obtenidas (morfolog\u00eda, \ncomportamiento mec\u00e1nico, propiedades t\u00e9rmicas y propiedades \nde barrera). La actividad antimicrobiana proporcionada por los \naditivos a estos sistemas de envasado fue evaluada frente a una \nbacteria Gram positiva  (Staphylococcus aureus  y otra Gram  negativa  \n(Escherichia coli) . Tambi\u00e9n se estudi\u00f3 la liberaci\u00f3n de timol y \ncarvacrol desde la matriz polim\u00e9rica hacia distintos simulantes \nalimentarios; incluyendo un estudio cin\u00e9tico para modelar el \ncomportamiento de migraci\u00f3n de estos dos compuestos en \ndiversos medios. Tambi\u00e9n se ha evaluado la actividad \nantioxidante de los extractos obt enidos. Por \u00faltimo, la eficiencia \nde las nuevas pel\u00edculas activas fue evaluada estudiando el aumento \nde la vida \u00fatil de dos muestras de alimentos (fresas y pan de \nmolde) almacenados en diferentes condiciones.  \nResumen  \n~ 9 ~ \n ii. Desarrollo y caracterizaci\u00f3n de nanocompuestos activos en una \nmatriz de PLA y usando timol como aditivo activo. En este \npunto, dos formulaciones diferentes fueron propuestas.  \na. Nanocompuestos activos en base PLA con timol y una \nnanoarcilla comercial org\u00e1nicamente modificada \n(Dellite\u00ae43B, D43B). La caract erizaci\u00f3n de estos \nnanocompuestos se llev\u00f3 a cabo estudiando sus \npropiedades morfol\u00f3gicas, mec\u00e1nicas, t\u00e9rmicas, \u00f3pticas y \nde barrera a gases. Tambi\u00e9n se llev\u00f3 a cabo la evaluaci\u00f3n \nde la velocidad de desintegraci\u00f3n en condiciones de \ncompostaje, as\u00ed como el estudio de la liberaci\u00f3n de los \ncompuestos activos en condiciones controladas \nutilizando un simulante alimentario acuoso y la actividad \nantimicrobiana y antioxidante de las nuevas pel\u00edculas \nactivas.  \nb. Nanocompuestos activos utilizando PLA, timol y \nnanopart\u00edc ulas de plata, procesando dos tipos de \nmorfolog\u00edas: pel\u00edculas y probetas. Se llev\u00f3 a cabo una \ncaracterizaci\u00f3n completa de las nuevas formulaciones, en \nlo referente a sus propiedades morfol\u00f3gicas, mec\u00e1nicas, \nt\u00e9rmicas, \u00f3pticas y de barrera a ox\u00edgeno y vapor de agua. \nLa desintegraci\u00f3n de estos nanocompuestos fue evaluada \nen condiciones de compostaje. Se llevaron a cabo \nestudios de liberaci\u00f3n en un simulante alimentario \nacuoso. Por \u00faltimo , se estudi\u00f3 la actividad antioxidante y \nla actividad antimicrobiana de es tos nanocompuestos \nactivos.  \n \nResumen  \n~ 10 ~ \n 3. Resultados y discusi\u00f3n  \n3.1. Cap\u00edtulo 1  \nEl timol y el carvacrol han sido seleccionados para ser adicionados a las \nnuevas formulaciones activas en base PP debido a sus caracter\u00edsticas \nantimicrobianas y antioxidantes y su origen natura l. Un total de nueve \nformulaciones activas se han obtenido con 4, 6 y 8 % en peso de timol \ny/o carvacrol, que fueron utilizadas para obtener las diferentes pel\u00edculas \nactivas. Una vez obtenidas las pel\u00edculas mediante  mezclado en fundido \nseguido de  moldeo po r compresi\u00f3n se caracterizaron evaluando sus \npropiedades t\u00e9rmicas, morfol\u00f3gicas, mec\u00e1nicas y funcionales.  \nLos resultados obtenidos en este cap\u00edtulo mostraron que la presencia de \nlos aditivos no afect\u00f3 a la estabilidad t\u00e9rmica de la matriz de PP, pero s\u00ed \nque produjo una disminuci\u00f3n significativa de la cristalinidad del material \ndebido a las interacciones entre la matriz polim\u00e9rica y los aditivos. Esta \ndisminuci\u00f3n en la estructura cristalina del material tiene una importante \ninfluencia sobre los ensayos de tr acci\u00f3n, donde se observ\u00f3 un significativo \ndescenso en el m\u00f3dulo el\u00e1stico y por tanto en la rigidez del material. Estos \nresultados adem\u00e1s indicaron que la presencia de timol y carvacrol tuvieron \nun ligero efecto plastificante sobre la matriz polim\u00e9rica.  \nLas im\u00e1genes obtenidas de estos materiales mediante microscop\u00eda \nelectr\u00f3nica de barrido (SEM) mostraron superficies homog\u00e9neas en todas \nlas pel\u00edculas, pero una cierta porosidad supericial en las de mayor \nconcentraci\u00f3n de aditivos debido probablemente a una eva poraci\u00f3n \nparcial del timol y/o carvacrol durante el procesado, aunque en los \nestudios mediante an\u00e1lisis termogravim\u00e9trico (TGA) se comprob\u00f3 que \nuna fracci\u00f3n importante de dichos aditivos permaneci\u00f3 en la matriz tras el \nprocesado.  \nResumen  \n~ 11 ~ \n Los resultados obtenidos p ara los par\u00e1metros de inducci\u00f3n a la oxidaci\u00f3n \ndemostraron que la adici\u00f3n de timol y carvacrol favoreci\u00f3 el incremento \nde la estabilidad ante la oxidaci\u00f3n a temperaturas altas, demostrando con \nello la actividad antioxidante de ambos aditivos. Adem\u00e1s, el es tudio \nantimicrobiano demostr\u00f3 que las formulaciones a concentraciones \nelevadas de timol (8 % en peso) presentaron una mayor actividad \nantimicrobiana.  \nSe evalu\u00f3 la capacidad de liberaci\u00f3n de las nuevas pel\u00edculas mediante \nestudios de migraci\u00f3n. Para ello , se seleccionaron las formulaciones con \nmayor concentraci\u00f3n de aditivo (8 % en peso) y la migraci\u00f3n de carvacrol \ny timol se determin\u00f3 utilizando procedimientos anal\u00edticos r\u00e1pidos y fiables, \ndesarrollados y validados en este mismo trabajo, para la determinaci\u00f3 n de \nlos extractos obtenidos en diferentes simulantes alimentarios: agua \ndestilada (A), \u00e1cido ac\u00e9tico 3 % (p/v) (B), y etanol 10 % (v/v) (C) como \nsimulantes acuosos y etanol 95 % (v/v) e iso -octano como simulantes \ngrasos. Para los extractos obtenidos a par tir de los simulantes acuosos se \nllev\u00f3 a cabo un proceso de extracci\u00f3n en fase s\u00f3lida (SPE) del timol y \ncarvacrol migrado seguido de determinaci\u00f3n mediante cromatograf\u00eda de \ngases acoplada a espectrometr\u00eda de masas (GC/MS). En el caso de los \nextractos de mi graci\u00f3n obtenidos a partir de los simulantes grasos ambos \ncompuestos fueron analizados directamente mediante GC/MS y tambi\u00e9n \nusando cromatograf\u00eda de l\u00edquidos  de alta resoluci\u00f3n con detecci\u00f3n por \nespectrofotometr\u00eda ultravioleta -visible (HPLC -UV) para iso -octano y \netanol 95 % (v/v) , respectivamente.  \nLos resultados obtenidos en estos ensayos demostraron que la liberaci\u00f3n \nde timol y/o carvacrol desde la matriz polim\u00e9rica era dependiente del tipo \nde aditivo y del simulante alimentario utilizado. En concreto, los  niveles \nm\u00e1s elevados de migraci\u00f3n se obtuvieron para ambos aditivos en iso -\nResumen  \n~ 12 ~ \n octano, mostrando el timol una migraci\u00f3n superior a 1000 mg por kg de \nsimulante. La cin\u00e9tica de liberaci\u00f3n de timol y carvacrol en las pel\u00edculas \nobtenidas siguieron un comportamien to de acuerdo con las leyes de Fick \npara la difusi\u00f3n de componentes de bajo peso molecular en matrices \npolim\u00e9ricas, con unos valores del coeficiente de difusi\u00f3n que oscilaron \nentre 1 hasta 2 x 10-14 m2 s-1; aunque la difusi\u00f3n en iso -octano fue entre 4 y \n6 veces superior a estos valores.  \nLa actividad antioxidante de los extractos de migraci\u00f3n fue confirmada \npor el m\u00e9todo de formaci\u00f3n del complejo coloreado DPPH (1,1 -difenil -2-\npicril -hidrazilo), demostrando que el timol posee una mayor actividad \nantioxidante especialmente en iso -octano con un 42,2 % de inhibici\u00f3n.  \nPor \u00faltimo , se estudi\u00f3 la liberaci\u00f3n de timol y carvacrol en dos alimentos \nreales utilizando la micro -extracci\u00f3n en fase s\u00f3lida para evaluar la cantidad \nde timol o carvacrol liberados en el espacio de cabeza. Se llev\u00f3 a cabo una \nevaluaci\u00f3n visual que permiti\u00f3 comprob ar que la degradaci\u00f3n \norganol\u00e9ptica de las fresas y el pan de molde se retras \u00f3, permitiendo un \naumento en la vida \u00fatil de varios d\u00edas en ambos alimentos. Tambi\u00e9n se \nidentific\u00f3 la presencia de sustancias liberadas relacionadas con la \ndegradaci\u00f3n de los alim entos y se observ\u00f3 la aparici\u00f3n de estas sustancias \na tiempos m\u00e1s largos en los sistemas de envasado activo.  \n \n3.2. Capitulo 2  \nEn la primera parte de este cap\u00edtulo se utiliz\u00f3 el PLA como matriz \nbiopolim\u00e9rica, y D43B como nanoarcilla con el fin de obtener nuevas \nformulaciones activas con timol. Uno de los objetivos que se persiguieron \ncon la incorporaci\u00f3n de la nanoarcilla era mejorar las propiedades \nmec\u00e1nicas del nanocompuesto, debido a su dispersi\u00f3n entre las cadenas \nResumen  \n~ 13 ~ \n polim\u00e9ricas y por tanto al efecto de refuerzo  que proporciona a la matriz \ndebido a su estructura laminar. Se comprob\u00f3 que la incorporaci\u00f3n de \nD43B condujo a un aumento en el m\u00f3dulo el\u00e1stico y una disminuci\u00f3n de \nla elongaci\u00f3n a ruptura. En cambio , la adici\u00f3n de timol provoc\u00f3 un \ndescenso alrededor del 15 % en los valores del m\u00f3dulo el\u00e1stico respecto a \nlos del PLA puro. Estos resultados son concordantes con el ligero efecto \nplastificante observado mediante calorimetr\u00eda diferencial de barrido (DSC) \nen los nanocompuestos activos, con una disminuci\u00f3n en la temperatra de \ntransici\u00f3n v\u00edtrea ( Tg) de aproximadamente 13 \u00b0C para las formulaciones \ncon timol. Sin embargo, los resultados obtenidos mediante TGA \ndemostraron que la estabilidad t\u00e9rmica del PLA no se vio afectada \nsignificativamente por la adici\u00f3n de timol ni por la presencia de la \nnanoarcilla.  \nEl an\u00e1lisis estructural de estos nanocompuestos activos demostr\u00f3 la \nintercalaci\u00f3n de la nanoarcilla laminar entre las cadenas polim\u00e9ricas, ya \nque en los espectros de difracci\u00f3n por rayos X ( XRD ) se observ\u00f3 un \ndesplaza miento del pico caracter\u00edstico de difracci\u00f3n desde 19,2 \u00c5 para la \nnanoarcilla pura hasta 35,6 \u00c5 para los nanocompuestos. Asimismo, las \nim\u00e1genes obtenidas mediante microscop\u00eda electr\u00f3nica de transmisi\u00f3n \n(TEM) mostraron una dispersi\u00f3n parcial, e  incluso en a lgunas zonas se \npudo apreciar cierta exfoliaci\u00f3n de las l\u00e1minas de nanoarcilla en el seno de \nla matriz polim\u00e9rica.  \nLa cantidad remanente de timol determinada en estas formulaciones tras el \nprocesado mediante HPLC -UV fue 5,57 \u00b1 0,01 % en peso para la \nformul aci\u00f3n con 8 % en peso de timol, y 5,99 \u00b1 0,03 % en peso y 5,78 \u00b1 \n0,02 % en peso para las formulaciones con timol y 2,5 y 5 % en peso de \nD43B , respectivamente. De este modo , queda demostrada la presencia de \ntimol tras el procesado, as\u00ed como un efecto de pro tecci\u00f3n de la nanoarcilla \nResumen  \n~ 14 ~ \n sobre el timol cuando ambos se encuentran dispersos en la matriz \npolim\u00e9rica impidiendo su p\u00e9rdida durante el procesado.  \nA la hora de evaluar el car\u00e1cter biodegradable de los nanocompuestos \ndesarrollados en este cap\u00edtulo se llev\u00f3 a  cabo un estudio de desintegraci\u00f3n \nbajo condiciones de compostaje y seg\u00fan la normativa vigente para este \ntipo de ensayos. Los resultados mostraron que \u00fanicamente son necesarios \n35 d\u00edas para lograr un porcentaje de desintegraci\u00f3n superior al 90 %, \ncumpliend o de esta forma los requerimientos impuestos por la legislaci\u00f3n. \nEl proceso de degradaci\u00f3n de estos materiales es debido en gran medida a \nla degradaci\u00f3n hidrol\u00edtica de sus cadenas polim\u00e9ricas, vi\u00e9ndose favorecido \nel proceso por la presencia de timol debido  a los grupos hidroxilo libres en \nla estructura del nanocompuesto. Las muestras sometidas a estos ensayos \nfueron tambi\u00e9n caracterizadas mediante espectroscopia infrarroja por \ntransformada de Fourier (FTIR) y DSC. Se pudo demostrar una relaci\u00f3n \ndirecta entr e los cambios visuales con la progresiva degradaci\u00f3n de las \nformulaciones estudiadas ya que se observ\u00f3 un claro descenso en la \nintensidad de pico relacionada con el grupo carbonilo ( -C=O) de la lactida \na 1750 cm-1 y una simultanea aparici\u00f3n de un pico cara cter\u00edstico de los \ncarbonilos, a causa del grupo \u00e1cido carbox\u00edlico formado por  la ruptura \nhidrol\u00edtica de los \u00e9 steres. Asimismo , se observ\u00f3 un descenso del valor de \nTg y la aparici\u00f3n de picos endot\u00e9rmicos de fusi\u00f3n debidos al proceso de \ndegradaci\u00f3n relaciona do con la cristalinidad.  \nLa aplicabilidad de estos nanocompuestos en base PLA a sistemas de \nenvasado activo se evalu\u00f3 mediante un estudio de liberaci\u00f3n utilizando \ncomo simulante alimentario etanol 10 % (v/v). El estudio de migraci\u00f3n \nmostr\u00f3 una liberaci\u00f3n c ontrolada de timol con el tiempo a trav\u00e9s de la \nmatriz polim\u00e9rica hasta alcanzar el simulante alimentario. Estos resultados \nsugirieron que era posible controlar la liberaci\u00f3n de timol en el sistema \nResumen  \n~ 15 ~ \n activo mediante la incorporaci\u00f3n de D43B, ya que un aument o en la \ndispersi\u00f3n de la nanoarcilla se tradujo en una disminuci\u00f3n de la velocidad \ndel proceso y del coeficiente de difusi\u00f3n.  \nLa actividad antioxidante de estos nanocompuestos se evalu\u00f3 en los \nextractos obtenidos antes y despu\u00e9s de los ensayos de migraci\u00f3n . El \nporcentaje de inhibici\u00f3n confirm\u00f3 que la cantidad de timol presente al \ninicio y tras el estudio de migraci\u00f3n era suficiente para alcanzar una \ninhibici\u00f3n de la oxidaci\u00f3n superior al 70 % confirmando de este modo la \ncapacidad antioxidante de las nuevas formulaciones.  \nLa actividad antimicrobiana de estas formulaciones fue evaluada utilizando \ndos tipos de bacterias caracter\u00edsticas de los alimentos, Staphylococcus aureus  \n(Gram positiva) y Escherichia  coli (Gram negativa). El ensayo se llev\u00f3 a cabo \nen condic iones aerobias colocando las pel\u00edculas en contacto con una \ndisoluci\u00f3n de una concentraci\u00f3n determinada de inoculo durante un \ntiempo de incubaci\u00f3n de 3 y 24 horas a 4, 24 y 37 \u00b0C. Los resultados \nmostraron que las formulaciones con timol y D43B presentaron una \ncapacidad de inhibici\u00f3n a diferentes tiempos y temperaturas superior a las \nformulaciones que incorporan los aditivos por separado. De este modo, se \nconfirm\u00f3  lo descrito en la bibliograf\u00eda referente al timol y su poder \nantimicrobiano frente a diferentes  bacterias y hongos; y a las nanoarcillas, \na las cuales se les atribuye un cierto poder antimicrobiano por el \nmodificador org\u00e1nico que las forma.  \n \nLa segunda parte del Cap\u00edtulo 2 se centr\u00f3 en el desarrollo de nuevos \nnanocompuestos activos basados en PLA, timol (6 y 8 % en peso) y Ag -\nNPs (1 % en peso). Las nuevas formulaciones se obtuvieron en dos \nmorfolog\u00edas, probetas y pel\u00edculas con un espesor aproximado de 40 \u00b5m. \nEn ambos casos , se llev\u00f3 a cabo una caracterizaci\u00f3n f\u00edsico -qu\u00edmica \nResumen  \n~ 16 ~ \n completa y las pel\u00edculas tambi\u00e9n fueron utilizadas para evaluar la actividad \nantimicrobiana y antioxidante aportada por ambos aditivos.  \nLos resultados de caracterizaci\u00f3n en las probetas mostraron que la \ncombinaci\u00f3n de los dos aditivos tuvo  una cierta influencia en las \npropiedades finales del material, particularmente en su degradaci\u00f3n \nt\u00e9rmica y m\u00f3dulo el\u00e1stico. Se observ\u00f3 un descenso aproximado de 6 -12 \n\u00b0C en el valor de T g de los nanocompuestos a causa del ya comentado \nefecto plastificante del timol.  \nEn las im\u00e1genes obtenidas media nte microscopi a electr\u00f3nico de barrido  \nde emisi\u00f3n de  campo  (FESEM ) se pudo observar una buena distribuci\u00f3n \nde ambos aditivos y superficies homog\u00e9neas de los nanocompuestos que \nratificaron la buena dispersi\u00f3n de las Ag -NPs en la matriz polim\u00e9rica.  \nEn el cas o de las pel\u00edculas se llev\u00f3 a cabo una extracci\u00f3n s\u00f3lido -l\u00edquido \ncon posterior determinaci\u00f3n mediante HPLC -UV para determinar la \ncantidad de timol remanente tras el procesad o, que result\u00f3 ser \naproximadamente un 70 % del timol adicionado inicialmente antes del \nprocesado. El aspecto visual de las pel\u00edculas permiti\u00f3 apreciar superficies \nhomog\u00e9neas y con buena transparencia tras la adici\u00f3n de ambos \ncomponentes. Esta propiedad fue estudiada mediante espectrofotometr\u00eda \nUV-Vis a una longitud de onda caracter\u00edstica  de la regi\u00f3n del visible, \nobteni\u00e9ndose un valor de transmitancia en torno al 90 %.  \nUna vez llevada a cabo la caracterizaci\u00f3n \u00f3ptica se procedi\u00f3 al an\u00e1lisis de \nsus propiedades t\u00e9rmicas mediante TGA y DSC as\u00ed como de sus \npropiedades de barrera. Los resultad os mostraron una disminuci\u00f3n del \nvalor de T g en las pel\u00edculas debido a la adici\u00f3n del timol. La estabilidad \nt\u00e9rmica de las pel\u00edculas se vio influenciada por la presencia de ambos \naditivos. Los valores de OTR no fueron significativamente diferentes para \nlas formulaciones ensayadas por lo que no se em peor\u00f3 la permeabilidad al \nResumen  \n~ 17 ~ \n ox\u00edgeno, pero s\u00ed que se observ\u00f3 un descenso en la permeabilidad al vapor \nde agua en las formulaciones con timol, y en particular en las \nformulaciones que combinan el timol y Ag -NPs, obteni\u00e9ndose una mejora \nen las propiedades de ba rrera al vapor de agua en torno al 36 %.  \nUna vez caracterizadas las nuevas formulaciones se llev\u00f3 a cabo un \nestudio de desintegraci\u00f3n en compost a escala de laboratorio de acuerdo a \nla norma estandarizada UNE -EN ISO 20200:2006. Los resultados \nmostraron que  el inherente car\u00e1cter biodegradable del PLA fue mejorado \npor la adici\u00f3n de timol y Ag -NPs en el caso de las probetas, obteni\u00e9ndose \nuna degradaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s r\u00e1pida en aquellas formulaciones con presencia de \nambos aditivos. Fueron necesarios \u00fanicamente 57 d\u00edas p ara conseguir un \nporcentaje de desintegraci\u00f3n superior al 90 %, cumpliendo de esta forma \ncon los requerimientos indicados en la legislaci\u00f3n vigente. Sin embargo, en \nlas pel\u00edculas \u00fanicamente se necesitaron 14  d\u00edas para conseguir su \ndegradaci\u00f3n completa.  \nLas muestras obtenidas tras el estudio de degradaci\u00f3n fueron analizadas \nmediante FTIR, DSC y FESEM (\u00fanicamente en el caso de las muestras \nobtenidas a partir d e las probetas), con el fin de determinar los par\u00e1metros \nafectados en la degradaci\u00f3n y los posibles c ambios estructurales. Los \nresultados obtenidos mediante FTIR mostraron una relaci\u00f3n directa con \nlos cambios visuales observados a simple vista y con la progresiva \ndegradaci\u00f3n de las formulaciones con el tiempo ya que se observ\u00f3 un \nclaro descenso en la inte nsidad de pico relacionada con el grupo carbonilo \n(-C=O) de la lactida a 1750 cm-1 y una simultanea aparici\u00f3n de un pico \ncaracter\u00edstico de los carbonilos, el \u00e1cido carbox\u00edlico formado por  la \nruptura hidrol\u00edtica de los \u00e9 steres.  \nLas im\u00e1genes obtenidas median te FESEM mostraron importantes \ndiferencias a los 7 y 14 d\u00edas de ensayo ya que aparecieron fracturas y \nResumen  \n~ 18 ~ \n cavidades que evidenciaron la degradaci\u00f3n de los nanocompuestos \nactivos, en particular la formulaci\u00f3n con ambos aditivos en las que las \ncavidades ten\u00edan h asta 2 \u00b5m de di\u00e1metro.  \nPor \u00faltimo , el an\u00e1lisis t\u00e9rmico demostr\u00f3, tanto en probetas como en \npel\u00edculas, que el incremento de la movilidad de las cadenas polim\u00e9ricas \ncomo consecuencia del proceso de hidr\u00f3lisis provoc\u00f3 la aparici\u00f3n de \ncristalinidad observ\u00e1ndos e picos endot\u00e9rmicos de fusi\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, en el \nsegundo calentamiento se pu do observar un descenso en los valores de T g \nlo cual se relaciona con la  ruptura de cadenas polim\u00e9ricas y formaci\u00f3n de \nnuevas cadenas de olig\u00f3meros con caract er\u00edsticas plastificantes seg\u00fan fue  \naumentando el tiempo de ensayo.  \nLa actividad antimicrobiana de estas formulaciones fue evaluada con los \nmismos tipos de bacterias ya comentados y los resultados mostraron una \nelevada inhibici\u00f3n por parte de ambos aditivos, siendo la actividad \nantibacteriana de las pel\u00edculas con Ag -NPs y timol m\u00e1s elevada en el \nestudio con Staphylococcus aureus en comparaci\u00f3n con los resultados \nobtenidos con Escherichia coli , lo cual se puede explicar por las diferencias \nen la membrana celular de los dos tipos de b acterias, siendo las Gram \nnegativas m\u00e1s resistentes al ataque por parte de los compuestos fen\u00f3licos.  \nPara evaluar la liberaci\u00f3n de timol en contacto con alimentos se llev\u00f3 a \ncabo un estudio de migraci\u00f3n utilizando etanol 10 % (v/v) como \nsimulante alimentar io. Los resultados fueron obtenidos tras aplicar \ndiferentes modelos cin\u00e9ticos con el fin de describir de la manera m\u00e1s \npr\u00f3xima a los resultados experimentales los procesos de difusi\u00f3n del timol \na trav\u00e9s de la matriz polim\u00e9rica y su posterior liberaci\u00f3n al simulante \nalimentario. Los modelos aplicados permitieron concluir que dicha \nliberaci\u00f3n de timol se pod\u00eda describir con una cin\u00e9tica de pseudo -segundo \norden. Adem\u00e1s , se comprob\u00f3 que la adici\u00f3n de Ag -NPs limit\u00f3 la \nResumen  \n~ 19 ~ \n velocidad de liberaci\u00f3n de timol, induciendo  procesos m\u00e1s lentos al \nocupar parte de los huecos en la estructura polim\u00e9rica que el timol \nutilizaba para su difusi\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de la matriz.  \nTras evaluar la liberaci\u00f3n de timol, se procedi\u00f3 a estudiar la actividad \nantioxidante de los extractos obtenidos mediante el m\u00e9todo del DPPH. \nLos resultados mostraron que el porcentaje de inhibici\u00f3n aumentaba \nseg\u00fan lo hac\u00eda la concentraci\u00f3n de timol, es decir el tiempo de migraci\u00f3n. \nSin embargo, el porcentaje de inhibici\u00f3n fue m\u00e1s elevado en los \nnanocompuestos activo s, en particular, la formulaci\u00f3n con 8 % en peso de \ntimol y 1 % en peso de Ag -NPs.  \n \n4. Conclusiones  \nDe acuerdo con los objetivos propuestos en este trabajo y a la vista de los \nresultados obtenidos, se pueden extraer las siguientes conclusiones \ngenerales:  \nI. Se han obtenido pel\u00edculas de PP con 4, 6 y 8 % en peso de timol \ny/o carvacrol mediante mezclado en fundido y moldeo por \ncompresi\u00f3n. La caracterizaci\u00f3n de estas pel\u00edculas activas fue \nllevada a cabo con el uso de diferentes t\u00e9cnicas anal\u00edticas y \npermiti\u00f3 demostr ar la estabilidad t\u00e9rmica de las pel\u00edculas tras el \nprocesado. Adem\u00e1s , se comprob\u00f3 mediante DSC la disminuci\u00f3n \nde la T g y el desarrollo de cristalinidad de las pel\u00edculas activas, \njustificando de este modo un cierto efecto plastificante. Se \nobserv\u00f3 cierta po rosidad mediante SEM, sobre todo en las \nformulaciones con una concentraci\u00f3n elevada de aditivo. Debido \nal efecto plastificante, las propiedades mec\u00e1nicas de las pel\u00edculas \nactivas fueron modificadas, al igual que las propiedades de barrera \nResumen  \n~ 20 ~ \n a ox\u00edgeno. Por ej emplo, el m\u00f3dulo el\u00e1stico para las formulaciones \nactivas disminuy\u00f3 en comparaci\u00f3n con el obtenido para el PP \npuro. La presencia de timol y carvacrol tambi\u00e9n aument\u00f3 la \nestabilizaci\u00f3n frente la degradaci\u00f3n termo -oxidativa de las \npel\u00edculas basadas en PP, obt eni\u00e9ndose par\u00e1metros de inducci\u00f3n a \nla oxidaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s altos cuando se utiliz\u00f3 un 8 % en peso de timol \ny carvacrol, lo que sugiri\u00f3 que cierta cantidad de aditivo qued\u00f3 en \nla estructura polim\u00e9rica tras el procesado a altas temperaturas.  \nII. Las pel\u00edculas con 8 % en peso de carvacrol y timol mostraron un \ndoble efecto, ya que fueron capaces de liberar de forma \ncontrolada ambos aditivos y proteger de esta forma los alimentos \nde posibles degradaciones oxidativas y microbiol\u00f3gicas. Varios \nm\u00e9todos anal\u00edticos fueron desa rrollados y validados para \ndeterminar la cantidad de aditivo migrado en cada uno de los \nsimulantes alimentarios utilizados. Los resultados tras el estudio \nde liberaci\u00f3n de los aditivos mostr\u00f3 que depend\u00eda del simulante \nalimentario y de la cantidad de aditi vo incorporada a la matriz \npolim\u00e9rica. Se calcularon los coeficientes de difusi\u00f3n y se \ncomprob\u00f3 un comportamiento ajustado a las leyes de Fick de \ndifusi\u00f3n. Los niveles de migraci\u00f3n m\u00e1s elevados se obtuvieron en \nisooctano como simulante graso, en especial p ara las pel\u00edculas con \ntimol. La actividad AO aument\u00f3 con la liberaci\u00f3n controlada de \nambos aditivos en funci\u00f3n del tiempo. Las pel\u00edculas activas con \ntimol y carvacrol, pero en especial las de timol, mostraron cierta \ninhibici\u00f3n frente a Staphylococcus aureu s y Escherichia coli , en \nparticular frente a  la primera (Gram  positiva). Las pel\u00edculas activas \ndemostraron tras el estudio de vida \u00fatil utilizando fresas y pan de \nmolde que son capaces de alargar la viabilidad y calidad del \nResumen  \n~ 21 ~ \n alimento fresco debido a sus pro piedades antioxidantes y \nantimicrobianas.  \nIII. Se utilizaron una montmorillonita organo modificada (2,5 y 5 % \nen peso), D43B, y timol (8 % en peso) como aditivo activo para \nobtener nanocompuestos en forma de pel\u00edculas utilizando como \npol\u00edmero base el PLA. Dicha s pel\u00edculas se procesaron mediante \nmezclado en fundido y moldeo por compresi\u00f3n. Alrededor del  \n70-75 % de timol permaneci\u00f3 en los nanocompuestos activos tras \nel procesado, garantizando de este modo su aplicabilidad en \nsistemas activos. Las pel\u00edculas obtenid as mostraron una excelente \nintercalaci\u00f3n de las l\u00e1minas de la nanoarcilla a trav\u00e9s de la matriz \npolim\u00e9rica, presentando una exfoliaci\u00f3n parcial, sob re todo las \nformulaciones con 2, 5 % en peso de D43B, as\u00ed como un \ncomportamiento a la tracci\u00f3n diferente cuan do se compar\u00f3 con el \nPLA puro. Los resultados mostraron una cierta disminuci\u00f3n en el \nm\u00f3dulo el\u00e1stico debido al ligero efecto plastificante inducido por \nel timol, que, sin embargo, no afect\u00f3 significativamente la \nestabilidad t\u00e9rmica del PLA. La incorporaci\u00f3 n de ambos aditivos \nno result\u00f3 en una modificaci\u00f3n clara de las propiedades de \nbarrera a ox\u00edgeno, pero s\u00ed que se observaron algunas diferencias \nen el color de las pel\u00edculas activas debido principalmente al \ncambio inducido por el color natural de ambos adit ivos. La \ntransparencia intr\u00ednseca del PLA no se vio afectada por la \npresencia de los aditivos.  \nIV. La liberaci\u00f3n de timol se determin\u00f3 mediante HPLC -UV a \ndiferentes tiempos de migraci\u00f3n y se propuso un modelo cin\u00e9tico, \nlo que sugiri\u00f3 que la liberaci\u00f3n de timol  estaba influenciada por la \npresencia de la D43B en la matriz de PLA y se calcularon los \nResumen  \n~ 22 ~ \n coeficientes de difusi\u00f3n para todas las formulaciones con timol. \nEsta liberaci\u00f3n continua favoreci\u00f3 la actividad antioxidante de las \npel\u00edculas, resultando en un elevad o porcentaje de inhibici\u00f3n en el \nensayo DPPH. Por \u00faltimo, tras el estudio de la actividad \nantibacteriana, se concluy\u00f3 que la adici\u00f3n de la D43B produjo una \nmejora de la actividad de las pel\u00edculas.  \nV. Los nanocompuestos activos formados por PLA como pol\u00edmero \nbase, Ag -NPs (1 % en peso) y timol (6 y 8 % en peso) fueron \nobtenidos por extrusi\u00f3n en forma de pel\u00edculas y probetas \nmoldeadas por inyecci\u00f3n. El estudio mediante FESEM  mostr\u00f3 \nuna distribuci\u00f3n homog\u00e9nea de los dos aditivos en la matriz de \nPLA. Estos resultad os fueron corroborados por el descenso de la \npermeabilidad al vapor de agua, debido tambi\u00e9n en gran medida a \nla presencia de timol. La T g sufri\u00f3 un ligero descenso debido \n\u00fanicamente a la presencia de timol, lo que se tradujo en un cierto \nefecto plastifican te. \nVI. Las pel\u00edculas activas con Ag -NPs y timol mostraron resultados \nmuy satisfactorios en los estudios relacionados con su actividad \nantibacteriana, inhibiendo los dos tipos de bacterias a diferentes \ntiempos y temperaturas de incubaci\u00f3n, as\u00ed como elevados \nporcentajes de inhibici\u00f3n cuando se estudi\u00f3 la actividad \nantioxidante por el m\u00e9todo de DPPH. La liberaci\u00f3n de timol y \nAg-NPs desde la matriz polim\u00e9rica fue determinada a los 10 d\u00edas \nde estudio siendo la liberaci\u00f3n de timol muy superior a la de Ag -\nNPs. El est udio cin\u00e9tico sugiri\u00f3 que la liberaci\u00f3n de timol estaba \ninfluenciada por la presencia de Ag -NPs en la matriz de PLA.  \nVII. El estudio de degradaci\u00f3n de todos los nanocompuestos activos \nen condiciones de compostaje demostr\u00f3 el car\u00e1cter biodegradable \nResumen  \n~ 23 ~ \n del PLA, aunq ue la incorporaci\u00f3n de 8 % en peso de timol \nfavoreci\u00f3 la velocidad de desintegraci\u00f3n, debido a la presencia del \ngrupo hidroxilo en su estructura. Adem\u00e1s, la combinaci\u00f3n de \ntimol y Ag -NPs o timol y D43B provoc\u00f3 mayores velocidades de \ndegradaci\u00f3n, traduci\u00e9nd ose en ventajas medioambientales.  \nVIII. En resumen, las pel\u00edculas activas con 2,5 % en peso de D43B y 8 \n% en peso de timol basadas en PLA; y las pel\u00edculas activas \nutilizando tambi\u00e9n PLA con 1 % en peso de Ag -NPs y 8 % en \npeso de timol pueden ser consideradas com o posibles alternativas \na envases activos con matrices polim\u00e9ricas convencionales al \npresentar car\u00e1cter biodegradable y propiedades antimicrobianas y \nantioxidantes.  \n \nPor todo ello, y como conclusi\u00f3n general del presente trabajo de \ninvestigaci\u00f3n, se puede a firmar que la adici\u00f3n de componentes activos con \npropiedades antimicrobianas y antioxidantes, tales como carvacrol y timol, \na pol\u00edmeros convencionales (PP) o de fuentes renovables y caracter\u00edstica s \nbiodegradable s (PLA) en aplicaciones de envasado alimentar io muestran \nun gran potencial para mejorar la calidad y seguridad alimentarias. En \nparticular, la capacidad de liberaci\u00f3n, tanto desde matrices de PP como de \nPLA, ha mostrado el gran potencial de estos sistemas para ser utilizados \ncomo envases con caracter \u00edsticas antioxidantes y antimicrobianas para \ndiferentes productos alimenticios con el fin de extender su vida \u00fatil y \ncalidad organol\u00e9ptica y nutricional.  \n \n \n~ I ~ \n Table of contents  \nI.

Introduction  \n \nIntroduction  \n~ 3 ~ \n 1. Food packaging  \nPlastic industries are one of the main production sectors worldwide and \nhave experienced a continuous growth by widening their portfolio and \napplications window. The increase in plastics production has been \nreflected in numerous and important sectors of the World economy. In \ngeneral terms, the plastic industries can be conside red a key enabler of \ninnovation in many products and technologies in important sectors of the \nglobal economy, such as healthcare, energy generation, aerospace, \nautomotive, maritime, construction, electronics, packaging or textile.  \nWith a continuous growth for the last decades, global plastic production \nreached 299 million tonnes in 2013, with a 3.9 % increase compared to \n2012 (Plastics -Europe, 2015) . This increase has been recently observed in \nemerging countries, but it was not the case in the most developed \neconomies. For instance, the plastics production in Europe is currently \nstable, with no increase in the last decade and similar figures were \nobserved in 2013 when compared to those in 2002. Packaging, building \nand construction are the largest application sectors for the current \nproduction of plastics. Figure I. 1 shows the distribution of the plastics \nconsumption in Europe in 2013. In particular, the packaging sector \nrepresents 39.6 % of the total plastics demand  and almost half of them are \nused for food packaging in the form of films, sheets, bottles, cups, tubs,  \nor trays ; followed by building and construction with 20.3 % of the total \nEuropean demand. Automotive is the third sector with a share of 8.5 % \nand the rest of applications comprise a total of 31.6 % of the European \nplastics demand (Plastics -Europe, 2015) . \n \nIntroduction  \n~ 4 ~ \n 39.6%\nPackaging20.3%\nBuilding and \nconstruction\n8.5%\nAutomative\n5.6%\n4.3%\n21.7%\nOthersAgriculture\nConsumer and household appliances,\nfurniture, sport, health and safety, \u202646.3 Million tonnes\nElectrical and Electronics\n \nFigure I. 1. European plastics demand in 2013; (data taken from (Plastics-Europe, 2015) . \n \nPlastics are currently considered one of the four basic materials for food \npackaging, together with glass, metal and paper. Plastics are adequate  to \nsatisfy  the main function of food packaging, i.e. to maintain the quality \nand safety of food products from their processing to consumption, \nincluding storage and transportation. Packaging materials should provide \nmechanical, optical, and thermal protection while preventing unfavourable \ndegradation factors or conditions, such as spoilage microorganisms, \noxygen, moisture, chemical contaminants, light, external forces, high \ntemperatures, etc. (Rhim, Park and Ha, 2013) . \n \n1.1. From conventional polymers to bioplastics  \nAmong the basic food packaging materials, petroleum -based \nthermoplastics have been extensively us ed since their introduction in the \nIntroduction  \n~ 5 ~ \n 1950-1960 decades. They exhibit a range of properties that make them \nsuitable for specific applications in food packaging, such as  their large \navailability; relative low cost; good physico -chemical performance in \ntensile and tear strength; good barrier to oxygen, water vapour, CO 2 and \naromas; good processing capabilities; heat sealability; good aesthetic \nquality  and many others (Siracusa, Rocculi, Romani and Rosa, 2008) . \nThe most important t hermoplastics used in food packaging include low \ndensity polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), \npolypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyamides (PA) and poly(ethylene \nterephthalate) (PET), which exhibit many common properties ideal for \ntheir use in packaging, such as light weight; low processing  temperature \n(compared to metal and glass); variable barrier properties; good \nprintability; heat sealability and ease of conversion into different forms \n(Lim, Auras and Rubino, 2008) . Table I. 1 shows some general pr operties \nof the main thermoplastic polymers with interest in food packaging. There \nare some key properties that make thermoplastics one of the most \nfavourable material families for food packaging applications. For example, \nthermal properties provide import ant information about criteria to be \nconsidered during processing and their possible resistance to high \ntemperatures. Mechanical properties provide data on the ability of \npackaging materials to sustain their integrity under the influence of various \nexterna l factors occurring during processing, handling, and storage of the \npackaged food. Other important parameters, such as permeability to \noxygen and water vapour, should be also considered and controlled to \nselect the most adequate polymers or composite mater ials for foodstuff \nwith particular requirements (Bastarrachea, Dhawa n and Sablani, 2011) . \n \nIntroduction  \n~ 6 ~ \n Table I. 1.

Among the wide var iety of \npolyolefins, PP offers overall balanced properties, including flexibility; \ntensile strength; lightness; stability; moisture and chemical resistance; easy \nprocessability in different forms (films, small and high packs, etc.) and low \ncost; while it i s well suited for recycling and reuse.  PP is used in different \nsectors,  such as automotive, machinery fabrication, sanitary applications \nor packaging, where thermal resistance is required due to its high melting \npoint (168 \u00b0C), such as for hot -filled and m icrowavable trays (Fages, \nPascual, Fenollar, Garcia Sanoguera and Balart Gimeno, 2011) . In \naddition, these properties can be modified by altering the chain regularity \ncontent (tacticity) and distribution, and by the incorporation of modifiers \ninto the polymer matrix as fillers (Gocek and Adanur, 2012; Rawi, \nJayaraman and Bhattacharyya, 2014) . \nDespite the multiple advantages provided by conventional thermoplastics \nin their application to food packaging, the raising societal conce rns about \nIntroduction  \n~ 7 ~ \n environmental issues and the most recent policies implemented by \nauthorities at the international level have introduced some caution on their \nmassive use and uncontrolled disposal. For instance, in 2012, according to \nthe Association of Plastics M anufacturers in Europe, 25.2 million tonnes \nof post -consumer plastics ended up in the waste upstream, of which 62 % \nwas removed from the environment through recycling and energy \nrecovery processes while 38 % still went to landfills (Plastics -Europe, \n2015) . Non -biodegradable conventional thermoplastics cause serious \nenvironmental problems since they are not easily degraded in Nature, \ntaking centuries to be decomposed into their simple constituen ts and \nabsorbed by the environment.  This problem has become a global concern, \nin particular from the beginning of the XXI century, since environmental \nproblems, such as the climate change, CO 2 footprint and the noticeable \nshortage in fossil resources have propelled the search for better concepts \nand sustainable alternatives to conventional plastics for packaging. Reuse \nand plastics  recycling are the most extended alternatives to disposal, but \nother possibilities are being studied for immediate implementatio n in \nmassive production.  \nNovel bio -based and biodegradable plastics for food packaging should be \ndeveloped by strictly following the guidelines for the efficient use of \nnatural and renewable resources, keeping the properties of conventional \nthermoplastics to preserve food quality and consumer safety, while \nreducing waste disposal and CO 2 footprint by offering new recovery \noptions. In general terms, novel bio -based and biodegradable plastics \ncould be obtained and modified from raw materials with biological o rigin, \nor more precisely from renewable resources, to permit a significant \nreduction in the environmental impact of packaging materials by reducing \nthe waste disposal problems and alleviate the overdependence from \nIntroduction  \n~ 8 ~ \n petroleum and other non -renewable sources (Rhim, Park and Ha, 2013) . \nIn addition, they should be treated by various recycling and reco very \ntechniques to get waste streams easy for treating and versatile enough to \nget efficient processes, such as composting, bio -refineries and others. \nAmong them, the use of novel bio -based and biodegradable packaging \nmaterials is recognized as one of the main trending topics in the research \nfor new materials, keeping the guiding principle of the efficient use of \nrenewable resources and their easy conversion into simple constituents to \nclose the natural cycle ( Figure I. 2). \nEnergy and organic recovery \nBiotechnology \nand  chemistryReuse\n \nFigure I. 2. Life cycle of bioplastics.  \n \nAccording to the European Bioplastics Association, bioplastics are \ndefined as plastic s that are either bio -based, biodegradable or both. There \nare three main groups of bioplastics based on their renewable/non -\nrenewable origin and biodegradable/non -biodegradable character ( Figure \nI.3): \nIntroduction  \n~ 9 ~ \n i. Bio-based or partly bio -based, non -biodegradable plastics, such as \nBio-PE, Bio -PET and Bio -PA. These materials are characterized \nby their bio -based origin (most of them are obtained from sugar -\nrich fractions in the bio -ethanol production) and their properties \nare similar to those of the main commodities used in food \npackaging, such as polyolefins. However, they are non -\nbiodegradable and their waste disposal is similar to the \nconventional thermoplasti cs. \nii. Biodegradable plastics based on fossil resources, such as \npoly(butyrate adipate terephthalate) copolymer (PBAT) or poly(\u03b5 -\ncaprolactone) (PCL). These biopo lymers degrade fast under \nenvironmental conditions, but they are obtained from petroleum. \nThey sho w, in general, good properties for food packaging \nmaterials but their production costs are high and they are not yet \ncompetitive with conventional thermoplastics.  \n \nBio-based and biodegradable plastics, including poly(lactic acid) (PLA), \ncellulose, starch -based plastics, animal proteins and \npoly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHA). These biopolymers are the ideal solution \nfrom the environmental point of view, but most of them fail in some of \nthe key properties for food packaging applications, such as thermal \nresistance  and barrier effect, making necessary their modification with \nadditives to improve these characteristics.  Table I. 2 summarizes the most \nimportant comme rcial bio -based and biodegradable polymers and their \nmain properties. This group of bioplastics has produced great interest by \ntheir high potential in becoming a sustainable alternative to conventional \nthermoplastics.

This continuous growth in the bioplastics production \nfor food packaging is also possible by the similarity in machinery and \nIntroduction  \n~ 11 ~ \n processing conditions to those traditionally used with conventional \nthermoplastics. Indeed, no special machinery is required for the \nprocessing of bioplastics, with just some changes in the processing \nparameters depending on their properties.  \n \n11.4 %\nPLA\n11.3 %\nStarch blends\n10.8 %\nPBAT, PBS, PCL\n37 %\nBio-based PET12.3 %\nBio-based PE6.8 %\nPTT\nRegenerated Cellulose (1.7 %)\nOthersb(0.3 %)Bio-based PA (4.9 %)Othersa(1.4 %)\nPHA (2.1 %)Bio-based and Biodegradable  25.8 %\nbBiodegradable cellulose ester\naContains durable starch blends , Bio-PC, Bio-TPE, \nBio-PUR ( except thermosets)Bio-based and  non Biodegradable 62.4 % Fossil -based and Biodegradable 10.8 %\n \nFigure I. 4. Global production of bioplastics and by market segment in 2013 (adapted \nfrom the (European -Bioplastics -Association) . \n \n1.1.1. Poly(lactic acid)  \nPLA is a bio -based and biodegradable polymer with high commercial \npotential by its convenient properties, easy processing and relative low \ncost when compared to other bioplastics. PLA is compostable and \nbiocompatible, but also processable with standard equipment, permitting a \nreduction of costs and consequentl y making it competitive against all \nother bioplastics and most of the petroleum -based commodities.  \n \nIntroduction  \n~ 12 ~ \n Properties and applications  \nPLA has a significant presence in the market; with a production capacity \nabout 185,000 tonnes in 2013 (European -Bioplastics -Association, 2015a) . \nIn addition, its relative low price has increased the potential of PLA as an \nalternative material to some conventional polymers, such as PET or \nHDPE, because of PLA\u2019s favourable properties, such as high \ntransparency, excellent printability, and low -temperature sealability (Aura s, \nHarte, Selke and Hern\u00e1ndez, 2003; Gupta and Kumar, 2007) . \nPLA has certain limitations such as low deformation at break;  low heat \nresistance; high modulus; hydrophilic properties; brittle behaviour; and \ninsufficient barrier to oxygen, CO 2 and water vapour compared to other \nbenchmark packaging polymers, such as polyolefins and PET. These  \nfactors limit the use of PLA in the packaging industry (Hughes, Thomas, \nByun and Whiteside, 2012) . In consequence m ost research focus on \nimproving the mechanical and barrier properties of PLA by adding \nnanoclays, natural fibres or antioxidant (AO) additives for the \ndevelopment of PLA -based films (Gon\u00e7alves  et al, 2013; Farmahini -\nFarahani, Xiao and Zhao, 2014; Rawi, J ayaraman and Bhattacharyya, 2014; \nCumkur, Baouz and Yilmazer, 2015) . Other researchers placed emphasis \non the improvement of thermal stability (Hughes, Thomas, Byun and \nWhiteside, 2012; Ara\u00fajo, Botelho, Oliveira and Macha do, 2014; \nIturrondobeitia, Okariz, Guraya, Zaldua and Ibarretxe, 2014; Kovacevic, \nBischof and Fan, 2015) . \nPLA is  classified as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) by the FDA \n(Food and Drug Administration, USA) for its intended use as polymer for \nmanufacturing articles that will hold and/or package food. It has been also \nproposed for the formulation of transparent fi lms, but the inherent \nbrittleness and poor flexural properties of the polymer make necessary the \nIntroduction  \n~ 13 ~ \n addition of plasticizers to obtain the adequate flexibility for stretching \nfilms with no risks of rupture (Ljungberg and Wessl\u00e9n, 2005; Burgos, \nMartino and Jim\u00e9nez, 2013; Burgos, Tolaguera, Fiori and Jim\u00e9nez, 2014)  \nor the processing of b lends based on PLA with different biodegradable \nand non -biodegradable polyme rs, such as PCL (Zhao and Zhao, 2016) , \nPP (Jain et al, 2015)  or cellulose acetate (Kunthadong  et al, 2015) . \nCommercial PLA can be obtained in different grades, from pure poly(L -\nlactic acid) (PLLA) to pure poly(D -lactic acid) (PDLA), including their \ncopolymers at variable ratios. It is known that the PLA properties vary to \na large extent depending on the PLLA/PDL A ratio and their arrangement \nin the polymer chains (S\u00f6derg\u00e5rd and Stolt, 2010) . \nPLA wi th PLLA content higher than 90 % tends to be crystalline and it is \ncommercially produced in different grades, with a T g value around 60 -65 \n\u00b0C, crystallinity degree in the range of 15 -74 %, melting temperature \naround 173 -178 \u00b0C and tensile modulus of 2.7 -16 GPa (S\u00f6derg\u00e5rd and \nStolt, 2002) . These properties are adequate for the production of a \ntransparent, tough and brittle polymer, with mechanical resistance similar \nto PET and PS, and application in rigid containers for food packaging. It \nwas reported that T g, Tm and crystallinity of PLA decrease by decreasing \nthe PLLA/PLDA ratio (Jiang  et al, 2010) . \nCommercial PLA has distinctive properties over other bioplastics, such as \ngood appearance; transparency; relatively high melting temperature; high \ntensile properties; good biocompatibility; and low toxicity that have \nhelped to broade n its applications window. Indeed, it has been used in a \nvariety of applications, in addition to food packaging, in the \npharmaceutical and biomedical fields (Albertsson, Varma, Lochab, Finne -\nWistrand and Kumar, 2010) . In tissue engineering, PLA has demonstrated \nto be biocompatible and degradable into non -toxic components with  an \nIntroduction  \n~ 14 ~ \n in-vivo controllable degradation rate having a long history of use in \ndegradable surgical sutures (Lopes, Jardini and Filho, 2014; Salerno, \nFern\u00e1ndez -Guti\u00e9rrez, San Rom\u00e1n del Barrio and Domingo, 2015)\n \nProduction  \nLactic acid (2 -hydroxy propionic acid) (LA) is the single monomer of PLA \nand it is produced either by fermentation of \ncommercial name for D -glucose)  and other sugars extracted from plants, \nsuch as corn sugarcane, sugar beet and potatoes, \nLA has a chiral carbon atom and exists in two \nstereoisomers, namely L - and D - enantiomers (\nKumar, 2007; Jamshidian, Tehrany, Imran, Jacquot and Desobry, 2010)\n \n \nD-Lactic Acid (D -LA) L-Lactic Acid \nFigure I. 5.

Oligomers have been proposed for their use as PLA \nadditives with plasticizer performance (Burgos, Martino and Jim\u00e9nez, \n2013; Burgos, Tolaguera, Fiori and Jim\u00e9nez, 2014; Fiori and Ara, 2009).\nSeveral polymerization routes to obtain PL A from L\nbeen described  (Figure I. 6) (S\u00f6derg\u00e5rd and Stolt, 2010)\ncontrollable degradation rate having a long history of use in \n(Lopes, Jardini and Filho, 2014; Salerno, \nGuti\u00e9rrez, San Rom\u00e1n del Barrio and Domingo, 2015) .  \nhydroxy propionic acid) (LA) is the single monomer of PLA \nand it is produced either by fermentation of dextrose ( the common \nand other sugars extracted from plants, \nsuch as corn sugarcane, sugar beet and potatoes, or by chemical synthesis. \nLA has a chiral carbon atom and exists in two optically active \nenantiomers ( Figure I. 5) (Gupta and \nKumar, 2007; Jamshidian, Tehrany, Imran, Jacquot and Desobry, 2010) . \n \nLactic Acid (L-LA) \nChemical structures of LA.  \nPLA has variable molar mass, ranging from 1000 -2000 Da in the case of \noligomers to more than 100 kDa in the case of the high molar mass \npolymer, which is mostly used in processing and development of products \n(Jamshidian, Tehrany, Imran, Jacquot and \n.

Production routes of PLA (adapted from (S\u00f6derg\u00e5rd and Stolt, 2002; Gupta \nand Kumar, 2007; Av\u00e9rous, 2008) . \n \nDirect condensation is based on the polymerization of LA in the presence \nof catalysts at low pressures and high temperatures. The most common \ncatalysts are antimony oxides and stannous organometallic complexes \n(Lopes, Jardini and Filho, 2014) . PLA obtained by direct condensation is a \nlow molar mass polymer, by the difficulty in removing water from the \nIntroduction  \n~ 16 ~ \n highly viscous reaction mixture, resulting in oligomers with no relevant \napplications in food packaging (Gupta and Kumar, 2007; S\u00f6derg\u00e5rd and \nStolt, 2010) , but some potential as bio -based additives (Burgos, Tolaguera, \nFiori and Jim\u00e9nez, 2014).  \nPLA can be also obtained by d irect condensation in azeotropic solutions, \npermitting the production of high molar mass polymers. This technique \nallows working below the melting point of the polymer, preventing \ndepolymerization (Gupta and Kumar, 2007) . The azeotropic solutions \nused in PLA polymerization are mixtures of two or more liquids in such a \nratio t hat its composition cannot be changed by simple distillation and \nthey help in removing water as a by -product (Jamshidian, Tehrany, Imran, \nJacquot and Desobry, 2010)  resulting in highly pure PLA with molar mass \nup to 300 kDa.  \nROP is the most applied polymerization techn ique for PLA due to the \npossibility of an accurate control of the chemistry of the process resulting \nin polymers with high molar mass and low dispersion, which broadens \ntheir application fields (Albertsson, Varma, Lochab, Finne -Wistrand and \nKumar, 2010) . ROP is based on the synthesis of lactide, a cyclic dimer of \nlactic acid with three different forms: L -lactide, D -lactide, and meso -\nlactide, and further polymerization of this reaction intermediate. PLLA, \nPDLA and poly(DL -lactic acid) (PDLLA) are synthesized from L -lactide, \nD-lactide and DL -lactide, respectively. A wide range o f physical and \nmechanical properties and degradation rates can be achieved by \ncontrolling the ROP process and the molar mass and stereochemistry of \nthe monomers (Gupta and Kumar, 2007) . In addition, other parameters, \nsuch as racemization, lactide purity or the residual monomer content \nshould be controlled to ensure the qualit y of the PLA obtained by ROP. \nSmall amounts of impurities, such as residual monomers or oligomers \nIntroduction  \n~ 17 ~ \n formed during the process, nutrients, cell debris, and enantiomeric \nimpurities of LA, could drastically change the PLA properties; in \nparticular, crystallinit y and degradation rate (Inkinen, Hakkarainen, \nAlbertsson and Sodergard, 2011) . \n \n1.2. Active packaging  \nThe traditional concept for food packaging materials as mere containers \nwith no interaction with the packaged food to avoid contamination ( i.e. \npassive packaging) has been recently changed by the introduction of new \nparadigms where interactions have been permitted, promoting two new \nconcepts: active and intelligent packaging . In fact, research in new \ndevelopments in food packaging materials i s aimed by the increase in the \nconsumer\u2019s preferences for fresh, natural, healthy and easy -to-prepare \nfood, minimally processed and convenient from the nutritional point of \nview. Consequently, the food sector has experienced important changes \naimed to meet  these demands while adapting to the global market, which \nimplies an increase in time of food transport and distribution (Singh, Wani \nand Saengerlaub, 2011; Sanches -Silva et al, 2014) . \nThe developments associated to the active packaging concept for food \npackaging producers and consumers should take into account the process \nof mass transfer and interactions between food and packaging materials \n(Figure I. 7). These interactions could be divided into different individual \nprocesses, which could appear all together or be partially restricted in each  \nparticular case. These processes include migration of the material \ncomponents (monomers or additives) to foodstuff, sorption and \ndesorption of volatile compounds (flavours and aromas), changes in the \nfood moisture content, permeability to gases and the po ssible degradation \nIntroduction  \n~ 18 ~ \n of food by external conditions (Silva -Weiss, Ihl, Sobral, G\u00f3mez -Guill\u00e9n \nand Bifani, 2013) . All these physico -chemical processes should be \ncarefully studied to design and develop new packaging systems that leave \nbehind the conventional pa ssive container.  \n \n \nFigure I. 7. Interaction processes between food packaging materials and the environment.  \n \nActive and intelligent packaging systems were firstly defined by the \nFramework Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 on food \n(Regulation_(EC)/No -1935/2004) : \ni. \u201cActive food contact materials and articles\u201d are defined as \nmaterials and articles that a re intended to extend the shelf-life or \nto maintain or improve the condition of packaged food. They are \ndesigned to deliberately incorporate components that would \nrelease or absorb substances into or from the packaged food or \nthe environment surrounding the food.  \nii. \u201cIntelligent food contact ma terials and articles\u201d are defined as \nmaterials and articles that monitor the condition of packaged \nfood or the environment surrounding the food.  \n~ 19 ~ \n Active packaging includes the use of additives, which could be defined as \n\u201cfreshness enhancers\u201d, able to diffuse and interact with food by increasing \nthe packaging\u2019s functionalities , such as resistance to oxidation and \nmicrobiological spoilage or retention  of natural aromas and \nwell as food quality and safety (L\u00f3pez -G\u00f3mez e\nsummarizes the main causes of food spoilage and the strategies followed \nto limit or deactivate them.  \n \nFigure I. 8.

Figure I. 8 \nsummarizes the main causes of food spoilage and the strategies followed \n \nMechanisms that can cause a loss of quality in food and active packaging \n \nThe chemical nature of the additives used for such purpose is diverse, but \nall them should play their role efficiently by  scavenging or absorbing \n, ethylene, moisture and/or odour and flavour taints; \n, water vapour, ethanol, sorbates, AOs and/or other \nIntroduction  \n~ 20 ~ \n preservatives and antimicrobials (AMs); and/or by maintaining \ntemperature to avoid the food o verheating during transport and \ndistribution. New developments in active packaging materials, methods \nand effects on food have been under study in the last few years. These \nstudies are based on chemical, physical or biological actions to modify and \ncontrol  the interactions between materials, food and the packaging \nheadspace to achieve the desired outcome (G\u00f3mez -Estaca, L\u00f3pez -de-\nDicastillo, Hern \u00e1ndez -Mu\u00f1oz, Catal\u00e1 and Gavara, 2014; Mellinas  et al, \n2015; Valdes  et al, 2015) . \n \n1.2.1. Antimicrobial and antioxidant active packaging  \nAntimicrobial active packaging  is commonly designed to reduce the risk \nfrom pathogen attacks to food and to extend shelf-life by limiting spoilage \neffects caused by microorganisms. A wide range of agents with AM \ncharacteristics has been proposed, e.g. organic acids, bacteriocins, spice  \nextracts, thiosulphates, enzymes, proteins, isothiocyanates, antibiotics, \nfungicides, chelating agents, parabens and metals (Sung  et al, 2013) . All \nthem could be incorporated into or coated onto food packagin g materials \nto get the desired effect (Singh, Wani and Saengerlaub, 2011) . However, \nsome important features should be considered to design an efficient AM \npackaging system.  \ni. They should be able to get the controlled release of the AM agent \nfrom the polymer film in the adequate time to maximize \nefficiency. The fast release of the AM agent from the packaging \nmaterial to food is quite common and this is an important \ndrawback of these systems, since the effect of the active \ncompound is limited in time.  \nIntroduction  \n~ 21 ~ \n ii. The use of harmless substances is a requirement in food \npackaging and not all the proposed AM agents are currently \nincluded in the curren t legislation as chemicals intended to be in \ndirect contact with food.  \n \nAntioxidant active packaging  focuses on the improvement of the \nresistance to lipids oxidation retarding the natural processes that can lead \nto organoleptic deterioration and reduction of shelf-life of food products. \nThe use of active packaging materials with AO properties is relevant in \nmany types of food, but particularly for dried products and oxygen -\nsensitive food (G\u00f3mez -Estaca, L\u00f3pez -de-Dicastillo, Hern\u00e1ndez -Mu\u00f1oz, \nCatal\u00e1 and Gavara, 2014) . Moreover, some authors reporte d that the \naddition of natural AOs to polymer matrices can protect the polymer \nfrom degradation during processing, with the double effect of protection \nfor the material and food through controlled release mechanisms (Peltzer, \nNavarro, L\u00f3pez and Jim\u00e9nez, 2010; Wu, Qin , et al , 2014) . \nBoth types of active food packaging systems can be divided into two main \ngroups. This classification is based on the incorporation of the active \nadditive to the packaging material and the interaction between the agent \nand foodstuff (Bastarrachea, Dhawan and Sablani, 2011) . Most of them \nare based on the use of thin films of polymer where the active agent is \nembedded.  \ni. Films that allow the release of the active additive by following a \nparticular kinetic scheme. The AM and/or AO agent can be \nincorporated to the material either within the matrix or onto the \nmaterial surface. The strategy for incorporation is relevant to \ncontrol the release of active c ompounds from the material to the \nfood surface. Different approaches have been proposed:  \nIntroduction  \n~ 22 ~ \n a. Packaging systems incorporating the active additive in a \nsingle layer, permitting a gradual release into food.  \nb. Packaging systems with an inner layer which can be \nuseful to control the release rate of the AM and/or AO \ncompounds from the outer layer.  \nc. Packaging systems with a coating layer containing the \nactive additive.  \nii. Films that do not release the active additive but show a direct \ncontact with food inhibiting the m icrobial growth or lipid \noxidation on the food surface.  \nFigure I. 9 shows the sch eme of these different interaction mechanisms \nbetween active agents, p ackaging material and food.  \nAll these strategies for the incorporation of the active agents to the \npackaging material and further interaction with food have shown their \npotential, but some drawbacks related to the full control of the release \nkinetics of th e AM and/or AO compounds to food have been described \n(Anbinder, Peruzzo, Martino and Amalvy, 2015; Fuci\u00f1os  et al, 2015) . \nRecent studies have proposed the use of other strategies for the \nincorporation of active compounds to the packaging material permitting a \nmore efficient release to food. These new techniques are encapsulation, a \nprocess by which small particles of core materials are packed within the \nwall material to form capsules to protect bioactive compounds from \nadverse environment and permitting the controlled release at targeted sites \n(Marques, 2010; Ezhilarasi, Karthik, Chhanwal and \nAnandharamakrishnan, 2013; Dias  et al, 2014; Noronha, de Carvalho, Lino \nand Barreto, 2014; Wen  et al, 2016) , grafting, which is one of the most \npromising methods to functionalize polymers (Schreiber, Bozell, Hayes \nand Zivanovic, 2013)  and reinforcement with nanofillers with intrinsic \nIntroduction  \n~ 23 ~ \n AM properties, in particular metallic nanoparticles (Llorens, Lloret, \nPicouet, Trbojevich and Fernandez, 2012; Fortunati, Peltzer, Armentano, \nJim\u00e9nez and Kenny, 2013; Dias  et al, 2014; Fortunati  et al, 2014; Shankar, \nTeng, Li and Rhim, 2015) . \n \n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)Packaging\nInner Layer Outer Layer Coating Outer Layer\nPackaging PackagingPackagingFood Food\nFood FoodRelease Release\nRelease\nNot release \nDirect contact\n \nFigure I. 9.

The \nproposal of new bioplastics, such as PLA  or edible films and coatings, to \nsubstitute conventional plastics in active formulations has been recently \nreviewed (Rhim, Park and Ha, 2013; Mellinas  et al, 2015)  and many \nformulations have been proposed. Some of them are discussed below.  \nIntroduction  \n~ 24 ~ \n Manzanarez -L\u00f3pez et al reported a study based on PLA with 2.58 wt% of \n\u03b1-tocopherol as active additive with AO action for food packaging \n(Manzanarez -L\u00f3pez, Soto -Valdez, Auras and Peralta, 2011) . The main \noptical and thermal properties were evaluated as well as the kinetics of \ndiffusion of the active agent from the PLA matrix to ethanol and \nvegetable oil, as food simulants. Their results showed a slower diffusion of \n\u03b1-tocopherol to soybean oil th an to ethanol with 5.1 % and 12.9 % of \nrelease respectively after 60 days. Authors also studied the influence of \ntemperature in the release kinetics by testing their systems at temperatures \nbetween 20 and 40 \u00b0C. The release of \u03b1 -tocopherol from PLA films t o \nsoybean oil was enough to delay the oxidation at 20 and 30 \u00b0C, compared \nwith the oil put in contact with pure PLA films with no active agent in \ntheir composition. Jamshidian et al used the solvent casting processing to \nobtain films based on PLA with natu ral AOs, including \u03b1 -tocopherol, and \nsynthetic phenolic AOs, such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), \nbutylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate or tert -butylhydroquinone \n(TBHQ) (Jamshidian, Tehrany and Desobry, 2013) . They studied the \nrelease of all these AOs to dif ferent food simulants and calculated the \nkinetic coefficients. It was concluded that antioxidant active packaging \nwas adequate for foodstuff protection and \u03b1-tocopherol  can be used as a \nnatural additive.  \nWu et al evaluated the AM activity of films based on  PLA combined with \nPCL and thymol as active agent (Wu, Qin , et al , 2014) . Results showed \nthat the addition of thymol to the biopolymer matrix had a plasticizing \neffect by the decrease in the PLA T g values and crystallinity, but not \naffecting the thermal stability of films. The AM activity was also evaluated \nand they re ported that films with thymol showed inhibition against two \nfoodborne bacteria: Escherichia coli  and Listeria monocytogenes . \nIntroduction  \n~ 25 ~ \n Polysaccharides, lipids, proteins or their blends can be used as edible \nbiopolymer matrices in active food packaging applications (Rhim, Park \nand Ha, 2013) . Indeed, chitosan was proposed as edible matrix on \nbioactive coatin gs containing organic acids and nanoemulsions with \ncarvacrol, mandarin, bergamot and lemon essential oils (EOs) (Cruz -\nRomero, Murphy, Morris, Cummins and Kerry, 2013) . Gamma irradiation \nand modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) were proposed to increase \nefficiency of the active films in food (Severino  et al, 2015) . These authors \nconfirmed the strong AM activity of carvacrol nanoemulsions against two \nGram -negative pathogenic bacteria ( Escherichia coli  and Salmonella \ntyphimurium ). Authors stated th at the bioactive coating with carvacrol onto \nthe chitosan matrix resulted satisfactory in the total inhibition of these \nbacteria after 11 days of storage, highlighting the strong bactericidal effect \nof this coating.  \nThe effects of the addition of BHT and g reen tea extracts (GTE) on the \nphysical, barrier, mechanical, thermal and AO properties of potato starch \nfilms were reported (u Nisa  et al, 2015) . The AO properties of these \nbioactive composites were evaluated by using the spectrophotometric \nmethod with formation of the 2,2 -diphenyl -1-picrylhydrazyl ( DPPH) \ncomplex, permitting the determination of the radical scavenging ability of \nboth (BHT and GTE starch films) after their contact with the fatty food \nsimulant (ethanol 95 %, v/v). The formation of methamyoglobin was \nmonitored while the lipid oxidation was evaluated by using the \nthiobarbituric acid r eactive substances (TBARS ) method. GTE and BHT \nfilms were individually applied to fresh beef samples stored at 4 \u00b0C and \nroom temperature (RT) for 10 days. It was concluded that the addition of \nBHT and GTE extracts resulted in the decrease in the concentrat ion of \nmethamyoglobin and TBARS values.  \nIntroduction  \n~ 26 ~ \n 2. Natural additives  \nThe selection of the most adequate natural compounds to be used as AO \nor AM additives in active packaging formulations depends primarily on \ntheir activity against oxygen or the targeted microorganis ms and their \ncompatibility with the packaged food, while the continued release during \nstorage and distribution is necessary to extend food shelf-life and quality \n(Manzanarez -L\u00f3pez, Soto -Valdez, Auras and Peralta, 2011) . But many \nother factors should be considered in the design of active packaging \nsystems, such as their specific activity , resistance of microorganisms to the \nadditives action, release kinetics and mechanisms, storage and distribution \nconditions, physical and mechanical properties of the packaging materials \nand organoleptic characteristics of food (G\u00f3mez -Estaca, L\u00f3pez -de-\nDicastillo, Hern\u00e1ndez -Mu\u00f1oz, Catal\u00e1 and Gavar a, 2014) . All these factors \nshould be carefully considered in agreement with the requirements stated \nin legal regulations (Dainelli, Gontard, Spyropoulos, van den Beuken and \nTobback, 2008) . \nAll these considerations have led to the search for natural compounds to \nbe used in active packaging formulations in substitution of the synthetic \nadditives. Many studies have been performed to propose the use of \ncompounds obtained from nat ural sources with AM and/or AO character \n(Srinivasan, 2012; Silva -Weiss, Ihl, Sobral, G\u00f3mez -Guill\u00e9n and Bifani, \n2013; Sung  et al, 2013; G\u00f3mez -Estaca, L\u00f3pez -de-Dicastillo, Hern\u00e1ndez -\nMu\u00f1oz, Catal\u00e1 and Gavara, 2014; Gyawali and Ibrahim, 2014; Vald\u00e9s, \nMellinas, Ramos, Garrig\u00f3s and Jim\u00e9nez, 2014; Valdes  et al, 2015) . \nNatural additives can be obtained from different sources, including p lants, \nanimals, bacteria, algae, fungi and by -products generated during the fruits \nand vegetables processing .

Compounds with potential activity from natural sources used in food \npackaging.  \n \nEOs are active agents obtained from plants, since they are fully -renewable \nadditives, easy to extract and highly efficient in their AM and/or AO \ncharacter. For example, the AO activity and AM effect against eig ht \nbacterial and nine fungal strains was evaluated in the EO of Mosla chinensis \nMaxim  and its methanol extract (Cao et al, 2009) . Results showed that t his \nEO, whose main components are carvacrol (57 %), p -cymene (14 %), \nthymol acetate (13 %), thymol (7 %) and c -terpinene (2 %), exhibited \ngreat potential against microorganisms, in particular against two Gram -\npositive bacteria common in many food products,  Staphylococcus aureus  and \nListeria monocytogenes . Moreover, high AO activity was also reported for this \nEO. \nIntroduction  \n~ 28 ~ \n In general terms, EOs are rich in monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, esters, \naldehydes, ketones, acids, flavonoids and polyphenols (\u0106avar Zeljkovi\u0107 \nand Maksim ovi\u0107, 2015) . All these chemicals have demonstrated their \nAO/AM character.  \nFigure I. 11. Chemical structures of some natural additives incorporated in active food \npackaging with AO/AM character (CAS numbers are indicated in parentheses).  \nFigure I. 11 summarizes names and molecular composition of  some of the \nmain bioactive compounds that can be obtained from plants, in particular \nEOs and extracts. These compounds have been recently incorporated into \nor coated onto packaging films and their performance as active additives \nhas been assessed. Li et al added different natural additives with AO \nproperties, obtained from green tea, grape seeds, ginger and gingko leaf, \ninto gelatin films with good results in the inhibition of the oxidation in \nselected food (Li, Miao, Wu, Chen and Zhang, 2014) . S\u00e1nchez -Aldana et al \nused lime EO as AM agent on edible films with high activity against \nfoodborne pathogenic bacteria ( Escherichia coli  O157:H7, Salmonella \ntyphimurium , Bacillus cereus , Staphylococcus aureus  and Listeria monocytogenes ) \ndetermined by the agar -disc diffusion method (S\u00e1nchez Aldana, Andrade -\nOchoa, Aguilar, Contreras -Esquivel and Nev\u00e1rez -Moorill\u00f3n, 2015) . \nPCL with \u03b1 -tocopherol (30, 50 and 70 wt%) incorporated by \nnanoencapsulation was proposed for the production of b iodegradable and \nAO films based on methylcellulose (MC) (Noronha, de Carvalho, Lino \nand Barreto, 2014) . Films were obtained by solvent casting and their \nmechanical and optical properties were determined together with their AO \nperformance and release kinetics. The incorporation of \u03b1-tocopherol to \nPCL films produced a modification of their mechanical propert ies, \ndecreasing their tensile strength around 60 % and the elastic modulus \naround 70 % when the nanocapsules percentage was high (70 wt%). These \n~ 29 ~ \n films showed high AO character by the incorporation of nanocapsules to \npermit the controlled release of \u03b1-tocop herol \n \nFigure I. 11.

In addition, most common \nbacteria, in particular pathogens, have lower proliferation rate at low pHs. \nThe mechanism of action of EOs against bacteria is not clear yet, since \neach compound present in the EO composition exhibit s a unique \nmechanism of action that is specific to a particular range of food and \nmicroorganisms (Bastarrachea, Dhawan and Sablani, 2011) . Different \nmechanisms have been identified: damage to the cell wall, interaction with \nand disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane, damage of membrane \nproteins, leakage of cellular comp onents, coagulation of cytoplasm and \ndepletion of the proton motive force. All these effects produce the \nmicroorganisms death by the modification of the structure and \ncomposition of the bacteria cells (Tajkarimi, Ibrahim and Cliver, 2010; \nKuorwel, Cran, Sonneveld, Miltz and Bigger, 2011b; Calo, Crandall, \nO'Bryan and Ricke, 2015) . \nTwo main types of bacterial cell wall structures have been studied, \npermitting their classification in Gram -positive and Gram -negative \norganisms ( Figure I. 12). Both types of cells have external cytoplasmic \nmembranes but some details, such as the presence of a thin peptidoglycan \nlayer in Gram -negative bacteria, make the difference (Aldred , Buck and \nVall, 2009)  and they should be more resistant to EO. These outer layers \ncontain lipids, proteins and lipopolysaccharides in their composition, \npreventing the penetration of hydrophobic compounds, such as EOs \n(Feng  et al, 2000; Maneerung, Tokura and Rujiravanit, 2008) . \n \n~ 31 ~ \n Figure I. 12.

Antioxidant activity of essential oils  \nEOs and their main compounds are some of the most important additives \nto avoid food degradation by lipid oxidation due to their high reactivity \nwith peroxyl radicals . The mechanism of action of these natural AOs in \nlipid oxidation reactions is focused on phenols and other compounds with \nhydroxyl groups presents in the EOs composition. Hydrogen atoms from \nphenol hydroxyl groups could react with the peroxyl radicals pro duced in \nthe early stages of the oxidation mechanisms to yield stable  phenoxyl \nradicals and, consequently, resulting in the termination of the lipid \nperoxidation chain reactions (Mastelic  et al, 2008; Amorati, Foti and \nValgimigli, 2013) . However, the AO activity of these phenolic compounds \ndepends on the electronic and steric effects of their ring substituents and \non the strength of hydrogen -bonding interaction s between the phenol and \nthe solvent in the EO (Mastelic  et al, 2008) . \nA large variety of testing methods have been proposed to evaluate the AO \nactivity of natural additives, either as pure compounds or plant extracts. \nSome of them are methods based on studies of the inhibition of the \nautoxidation reactions, which are commonly  followed by monitoring the \nkinetics of oxygen consumption and the hydroperoxides formation. The \nanalytical determination of secondary oxidation products ( e.g. carbonyl \ncompounds) has been also used and it is the basic reaction of the majority \nof the curre nt testing methods even though they do not involve substrate \nautoxidation. These methods can be direct, such as  ORAC (oxygen -radical \nantioxidant capacity) or  TOSC (total oxidant scavenging capacity). But the \nmost common are the indirect methods, which are based on the reduction \nof persistent radicals ( e.g. DPPH and TEAC (Trolox -Equivalent \nAntioxidant Capacity) method), or inorganic oxidizing species ( e.g. FRAP \n(Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) and Folin -Ciocalteu method) \nIntroduction  \n~ 33 ~ \n (S\u00e1nchez -Moreno, 2002; Amorati and Valgimigli, 2015) . The DPPH \nmethod is based on the idea that the AO effect is proportional to t he \ndisappearance of the DPPH\u2022 free radical in test samples. Figure I .13 \nshows the mechanism by which the DPPH\u2022 free radical accepts hydrogen \natoms from  an AO (Moon and Shibamoto, 2009) . \n \n \nFigure I .13. Reaction between the DPPH\u2022 radical and AO to form the DPPH complex.  \n \nBarbosa -Pereira et al based their studies in the evaluation of the AO \neffectiveness of different commercial products containing natural \nadditives incorporated into LDPE matrices by their effect on the delay of \nlipid oxidation in salmon muscles (Barbosa -Pereira et al, 2013) . The AO \nactivity of these films was tested by using the DPPH method and the \neffect in salmon muscle was evaluated by using the TBARS method. \nResults demonstrated that the natural products used in this trial had \nnoticeable AO effectiven ess, showing the best results the mixture of \nnatural tocopherols with good possibilities to replace synthetic AOs in \nfood packaging materials.  \n \n2.3. Carvacrol and Thymol  \nCarvacrol (5 -isopropyl -2-methylphenol) and thymol (2 -isopropyl -5-\nmethylphenol) are two phen olic monoterpenes widely studied as natural \nadditives in active packaging.

In this context, the effect \nof thymol and carvacrol against different microorganisms, such as Gram -\nnegative bacteria, food spoilage or pathogenic \nIntroduction  \n~ 35 ~ \n fungi and yeasts has been studied (Lambert, Skandamis, Coote and \nNychas, 2001; Burt, 2004; Xu, Zhou, Ji, Pei and Xu, 2008; Gutierrez, \nBarry -Ryan and Bourke, 2009; Hazzit, Baaliouamer, Ver\u00edssimo, Faleiro \nand Miguel, 2009; Arana -S\u00e1nchez  et al, 2010; Li  et al, 2010; Babili  et al, \n2011; Du, Avena -Bustillos, Hua and McHugh, 2011; Nostro and Papalia, \n2012; Friedman, 2014) . \nCarvacrol and thymol can be used in food packaging since both additives \nhave been approved as a safe food additive, in the U.S.A. due to their \nGRAS status and in Europe due to their classification as flavours \n(Commission_Regulation/(EU)/No -10/2011) . They have been \ntraditionally used as flavouring agents in foodstuff such as sweets, \nbeverage s and chewing gum (Commission_Decision/2002/113/EC; \nNostro and Papalia, 2012) . \nThe presence of the hydroxyl group in the carvacrol and thymol structures \nenhance their AM and AO activities (Gyawali and Ibrahim, 2014) . In both \ncases, the hydroxyl group acts as a proton exchanger, promoting the \nelectrons delocalization and reducing the pH gradient through the \ncytoplasmic membrane. This interaction with the microorganisms cell \nmembranes causes the collapse of the proton motive force, disrupting \nmembrane structures and ultimately leading to the cells death (Ultee, \nSlump, Steging and Smid, 2000) . More recently, Gyawali et al reported that \nthymol and carvacrol may show a different AM behaviour against Gram -\npositive and Gram -negative bacteria due to the location of thei r hydroxyl \ngroups, the meta position in thymol and the ortho position in carvacrol \n(Gyawali and Ibrahim, 2014) . \n \n \n \nIntroduction  \n~ 36 ~ \n 2.3.1.  Use in packaging materials  \nActive food packaging systems based on carvacrol and thymol have been \ntested in dry and fresh products, such as meat, cheese, fruits or vegetables. \nTable I. 4 summarizes the most relevant studies in active packaging with \ncarvacrol and/or thymol. These studies have evaluated different active \nmaterials in their thermal, mechanical and optical properties . Also,  the \nrelease kinetics and mechanisms of some additives from the polymer \nmatrix to food simulants or in direct contact with real food , as well as  lipid \noxidation or inhibition of foodborne bacteria  have been investigated . All \nthese studies reported that the addition of carvacrol and thymol to \npolymer mat rices can produce some modification of their physico -\nchemical properties. For example, edible films based on bovine gelatin \nwith carvacrol showed a clear decrease in their TS, swelling and water \nuptake, increasing the \u03b5B, water solubility and WVP compared to the neat \nfilms with no additives (Kavoosi, Dadfar, Mohammadi Purfard and \nMehrabi, 2013) . These important changes in properties were related to the \nhydroph ilic character of gelatin and chemical interactions with the \nhydrophobic carvacrol. Indeed, the hydrophobic domains of the gelatin \nstructure may interact with carvacrol enhancing the interfacial interaction \nbetween the polymer matrix and additives, saturat ing the gelatin network \nwith carvacrol molecules while water could not diffuse to the gelatin \nnetwork, causing the decrease in swelling and water uptake. In addition, \ncarvacrol showed some plasticizer effect when it was added to edible \nmatrices resulting i n changes in tensile properties, while some increase in \nthe ductility of the polymer blend was also observed.  \nAnother important feature related to the use of thymol and carvacrol in \nfood packaging systems is their high stability and control of their releas e \nto food over time (Kurek, Guinault, Voilley, Gali\u0107 and Debeaufort, 2014) . \nIntroduction  \n~ 37 ~ \n In fact, t he release rate is a ke y parameter to allow  a good and sustained \nmicrobial inhibition and AO activity of thymol and carvacrol.  Recent  \nwork s have reported the use of alternative techniques for their \nincorporation into polymers by using micro - or nano - encapsulation in \ncyclodextri ns with the aim to improve and control their release rate (Tao, \nHill, Peng and Gomes, 2014; Higueras, L\u00f3pez -Carballo, Gavara and \nHern\u00e1ndez -Mu\u00f1oz, 2015; Santos, Kamimura, Hill and Gomes, 2015) . \nIntroduction  \n~ 38 ~ \n Table I. 4.

Nanotechnology in the food industry  \nNanotechnology has developed in the last decade into a multidisciplinary \nfield of applied science and technology, representing a revolution in many \nconcepts in materials science. The novel properties and functions \nprovided by nanomaterials and the increasi ng possibilities offered by \nworking at the nano -scale, between 1 and 100 nanometers, has resulted in \nadvanced materials with a large number of potential applications, \nincluding food industry (Cushen, Kerry, Morris, Cruz -Romero and \nCummins, 2012) . In this general context, nanofillers have gained some \nspace as additives in food packaging materials by their action in imp roving \nsome of their key properties, including mechanical and barrier \nperformance.  \nThere are many different terms to refer to nanofillers depending on their \nmorphology, but the most accepted classification includes nanoparticles, \nnanofibrils, nanorods, nan ocrystals and nanotubes (Zaman, Manshoor, \nKhali d and Araby, 2014) . In particular, nanoparticles are defined as \ndiscrete entities with their three dimensions in the nano -scale (lower than \n100 nm).  Nanoparticles show larger surface area, aspect ratio and higher \nnumber of surface atoms than their micro scale counterparts (de Azeredo, \n2009) . The research in the use of nanoparticles in food packaging \nmaterials has increased s ince their introduction has allowed creating, \nunderstanding, characterizing and using these compounds in material \nstructures, devices and systems with novel and unseen properties and this \nis the main reason of their importance in food packaging application s \n(Cushen, Kerry, Morris, Cruz -Romero and Cummins, 2012) . In this area, \nnanotechnologies have offered innovation a nd technological advances all \nover the production chain; from primary production at the farming level, \nIntroduction  \n~ 42 ~ \n due to advances in pesticides efficiency and delivery, to processing and \nproperties of the final food product to improve taste, colour, flavour, \ntexture and consistency (Ezhilarasi, Karthik, Chhanwal and \nAnandharamakrishnan, 2013; Mihindukulasuriya and Lim, 2014) . Other \nimportant features of the use of nanotechnologies in food industries \ninclude  the increase in absorption and bioavailability of food and food \ningredients ( nutrients) by their  nanoencapsulation. Different methods \nhave been suggested to nanoencapsulate active principles into food \npackaging materials, such as spray -drying and electros pinning, showing \npromising results as novel delivery vehicles for supplementary food \ncompounds working with aqueous solutions at RT (Ghorani and Tucker, \n2015; Santos, Kamimura, Hill and Gomes, 2015; Wen  et al, 2016) . \nFigure I. 14 shows some of the main nanofillers that have been reported \nfor their incorporation into food contact materials to enhance their \nmechanical and barrier properties, to prevent their photodegradation and \nto preserve and extend the food shelf-life by their AM effect (Othman, \n2014) . \nOrganic origin Inorganic origin\nMetals\nSilver\nCopper\nGold\nPalladium\nIronMetal Oxides\nZnO\nTiO2\nMgO\nAgO\nCuO\nClays\nMica\nMontmorillonite\nSepiolite\nLaponiteNatural biopolymers\nChitosan\nChitin\nStarch\nCellulose\nNatural antimicrob . \nagents \nNisinCarbon nanofillers\nFullerenes\nGraphene\nCarbon nanotubes\n \nFigure I. 14. Nanofillers in food packaging applications.  \n \nIntroduction  \n~ 43 ~ \n 3.1. Nanoclays  \nMany types of commercial nanofillers have been proposed for their \nincorporation into polymer matrices to form nanocomposites. The initial \nresearch in this field was focused on the use of layered silicates, also \nknown as nanoclays. They typically have a sta cked arrangement of silicate \nlayers (nanoplatelets) with nanometric dimensions (de Azeredo, 2013; \nReddy, Vivekanandhan, Misra, Bhatia and  Mohanty, 2013) . \nThe most common crystalline arrangement in layered silicates is called the \nphyllosilicate structure, which is particularly remarkable in smectites which \nare based on 2:1 layers distribution made up of two tetrahedral \ncoordinated silicon atoms forming an edge -shared octahedral sheet. These \nsheets show central holes where native metal atoms, such as aluminum or \nmagnesium, could be found ( Figure I. 15) (Sinha Ray and Okamoto, 2003; \nReddy, Vivekanandhan, Misra, Bhatia and Mohanty, 2013) . The separation \nbetween layers is known as intergallery or interlayer spacing and it is due \nto the regular stacking of the layers, as observed in Figure I. 15. The  layers \ndimensions depend on the clay source and the preparation technique, but \nmost of them show thicknesses around 1 nm and their length vary from \ntens of nanometres  to more than one micron. Hence, phyllosilicates show \nvery high aspect ratio  (surface -to-volume) and surface area (Alexandre and \nDubois, 2000) . \n \nFigure I. 15. Crystallin e structure of smectites, (2:1 layered silicate structure) (T, tetrahedral \nsheet; O, octahedral sheet; C, intercalated c ations; d, interlayer distance) (Bordes, Pollet \nand Av\u00e9rous, 2009) . \n \nIntroduction  \n~ 44 ~ \n The substitution of the native metal atoms by other cations gives different \nfunctionalities and properti es to these nanoclays. These substitutions \ncould take place predominantly in the octahedral sheet; for example, Al3+ \ncould be replaced by Mg2+ or Fe2+. These substitutions generate negative \ncharges, which are counterbalanced by cations, such as Na+, K+, Li+ and \nCa2+ located within the interlayer spacing, producing an increase of the \nclay hydrophilic character and charged surface, which is characterized by \nthe cation exchange capacity (CEC), which is generally defined as \nmilliequivalents of cations in 100 g of layered silicates (meq/100g). In \ngeneral terms, CEC corresponds to the number of monovalent \ncountercations within the interlayer spacing and it is a characteristic \nparameter in layered silicates (Sinha Ray and Okamoto, 2003) . \nSmectites are the most common layered phyllosilicate due to their \navailability, low cost, significant enhan cement in key properties of \npolymers and relatively simple processability (de Azeredo, 2009) . Table I. 5 \nshows the characteristics of the main smectites and their structural \ncharacteristics.  \n \nTable I. 5.

However, this high \nswelling capacity makes MMTs hydrophilic resulting in low compatibility \nwith hydrophobic polymers (Raquez, Habibi, Murariu and Dubois, 2013) . \nTherefore , the organo -modification of layered MMTs is a requirement to \nget stable nanocomposites. These modifications are usually performed via \nion exchange reactions and have the main aim of matching the polymer \npolarity. Other techniques, such as organosilane gra fting, use of \nmonomers or block copolymers adsorption can be also used for such a \npurpose (Sreejarani and Suprakas, 2012) . \nIon exchange reactions in MMTs are based on the replacement of the \noriginal interlayer inorganic ions with organic cations, such as cationic \nsurfactants. These compounds include primary, secondary, tertiary and \nquaternary alkyl -ammonium or alkyl -phosphoniu m cations with at least \none long alkyl chain, called tallow chain (T) (Reddy, Vivekanandhan, \nMisra, Bhatia and Mohanty, 2013) . Furthermore, the use o f organo -\nmodified MMTs produce an increase of the interlayer spacing due to the \nlarge volume of the organo -modifying cations, favouring the dispersion of \norgano -modified montmorillonites (OMMTs) into their individual layers \nin the polymer matrix and thereb y improving in a high degree the service \nproperties of nanocomposites, in particular their mechanical and barrier \nperformance. Table I. 6 shows the mos t common commercial OMMTs \nbesides their characteristic features. In addition, the organic substituent \ncan provide specific functional groups able to react with the polymer \nmatrix or in some cases initiate  the polymerization process to improve the \nIntroduction  \n~ 46 ~ \n strength of the interface between the silicate and the polymer matrix \n(Reddy, Vivekanandhan, Misra, Bhatia and Mohanty, 2013) . \nInteractions between clays and polymer matrices are illustrated in Figure \nI.16 and they can be classified into three main groups (Bordes, Pollet and \nAv\u00e9rous, 2009) : \ni. Microcomposites, where clay particles are dispersed wit hin the \npolymer matrix but their layers are still stacked, resulting in two \nphases since the polymer is not intercalated within the silicate \nlayers due to the poor polymer -clay affinity. These materials can \nshow phase separation.  \nii. Intercalated nanocomposite s, where the polymer chains are \npartially intercalated between the silicate layers, but the system \nstill remains well ordered in a stacked type of arrangement with \nsome increase in the interlayer spacing.  \niii. Exfoliated nanocomposites, where the silicate layer s are \ncompletely delaminated from each other and the clay platelets are \nwell-dispersed between the polymer chains. In this case, the \nlayered structure of clays is not observed since polymer and clay \nform a unique continuous phase.  \n \nFigure I. 16. Polymer -clay structures according to the distribution of layered silicates into \nthe polymer matrix (de Az eredo, 2009) . \n \nIntroduction  \n~ 47 ~ \n Ara\u00fajo et al studied the influence of the clay organic modifier on the \nthermal stability of PLA -based nanocomposites with different commercial \nOMMTs, Cloisite\u00ae30B (C30B), Cloisite\u00ae15A (C15A) and Dellite\u00ae43B \n(D43B) at different concentrations (3 and 5 wt%) (Ara\u00fajo, Botelho, \nOliveira and Machado, 2014) . All nanocomposites were submitted to \nthermo -oxidative degradation at 140 \u00b0C for 120 hours by using an oven \nunder air atmosphere. Authors reported that the bette r dispersion \nachieved with C30B could be associated to the strong interactions \nbetween the carbonyl functions of PLA chains and the hydroxyl functions \nof the modifier, which improve the dispersion of this nanoclay through \nthe PLA matrix. They calculated th e interlayer spacing values (d -spacing \nvalues) by using Bragg's law and results showed high increases in d -\nspacing of nanocomposites with respect to the original matrix (1.60 nm \nfor C30B and 1.65 nm for D43B).  \n \n \nIntroduction  \n~ 48 ~ \n Table I. 6.

Silver nanoparticles (Ag -NPs)  \nMetallic nanofillers have found some space in the packaging technologies, \nin particular in active systems since they are able not only to enhance \nbarrier and mechanical properties when they are in corporated into \nmaterials in direct contact with food, but also to improve the food \npreservation and shelf-life by their AM performance (Jokar, Abdul \nRahman, Ibrahim, Abdullah and Tan, 2010; Erem, Ozcan, Erem and \nSkrifvars, 2013; Kanmani and Rhim, 2014b; Pagno  et al, 2015) . Copper, \nzinc, titanium, gold and silver NPs and some of their metallic oxides have \nbeen proposed as active additives to extend food shelf-life and to provide \naffordable and safe innovative  strategies (Llorens, Lloret, Picouet, \nTrbojevich and Fernandez, 2012) . \nAg-NPs are those most widely used for the development of active \npackaging materials by their high surface -to-volume ratio w hich provides \nbetter contact with microorganisms, showing their efficiency in AM \nbehaviour compared  to ionic silver. In addition, Ag -NPs show unique \nproperties in their electric, optical, catalytic, and thermal stability \nperformance (Dallas, Sharma and Zboril, 2011) . \nThe AM  activity of silver and silver salts has been well known for \ncenturies in their application in curative and preventive health care (Dallas, \nSharma and Zboril, 2011) . Some examples include the use of silver nitrate \nin the treatment of venereal diseases, fistulae and abscesses or in the \ntreatment of burn wounds (Klasen, 2000; Rai, Yadav and Gade, 2009) . \nIn the last decade, many researchers have reported the strong  AM activity \nof silver, in particular when it is used as nanoparticles, against a wide \nvariety of Gram -positive and Gram -negative bacteria, viruses and fungi \n(Kim  et al, 2007; Rai, Yadav and Gade, 2009; Sharma, Yngard and Lin, \nIntroduction  \n~ 50 ~ \n 2009) . However, the AM mechanism of the Ag -NPs is a highly \ncontroversi al subject, in particular when referred to materials in direct \ncontact with food. These controversies are mainly due to their small \ndimensions, required to achieve a significant AM effect, the requirement \nof an oxidized surface and the subsequent feasible exchange of silver ions. \nFor these reasons, the mechanism of the AM action of Ag -NPs is not well \nknown yet. The proposals for mechanisms suggested by several authors \nare supported by the morphological and structural changes found in the \nbacterial cells and  the possibilities of Ag -NPs to penetrate inside the \nbacterial structurel due to their attachment to the cell membrane (Reidy, \nHaase, Luch, Dawson and Lynch, 2013) . \nRhim et al proposed another mechanism to explain the activity of silver \nions and Ag -NPs against bacteria (Rhim, Park and Ha, 2013) . Silver ions \ninteract with negatively charged groups in the enzymes and nucleic acids, \ncausing direct damage to cell walls and m embranes by structural changes \nand deformation and leading to disruption of metabolic processes \nfollowed by cells death. It has been reported that the increase in the \nsurface area of Ag -NPs is associated with the high release rate of silver \nions and conseq uently the electrostatic attraction between the negative -\ncharged cell membranes and the positive -charged nanoparticles is \nimproved causing direct damage to the cell membranes (Kim  et al, 2007) . \nThe accumulation of Ag -NPs i n the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane can \nalso produce a significant increase in permeability with the result of Ag-\nNPs entering into the bacterial cells and altering the respiratory chain, cells \ndivision and finally leading to death  (Kim  et al, 2007; Rhim, Park and Ha, \n2013) . \nSondi  et al studied the surface morphology of Escherichia coli inoculated in  \nagar plates supplemented with Ag -NPs from 10 to 100 \u03bcg cm\u22123 (Sondi \nIntroduction  \n~ 51 ~ \n and Salopek -Sondi, 2004) . Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of \nthese bacteria  cell walls are shown in Figure I. 17. Figure I. 17A shows \nchanges in the treated bacterial cells resulting in major damage due to the \nformation of \u201cpits\u201d in cell walls. The energy dispersive X -ray analysis \n(EDAX) of these samples ( Figure I. 17B) showed that Ag -NPs were \nincorporated into the membrane of the treated bacterial  cells since the \ncharacteristic optical absorption peak of Ag at around 3 keV is observed \ndue to surface plasmon resonance.  \n \n \nFigure I. 17. (A) SEM micrographs of native Escherichia coli cells (a) and cells treated with \n50 \u03bcg cm\u22123 of Ag -NPs in liquid medium for 4 hours (b); (B) EDAX spectra of native \nEscherichia coli (a) and Escherichia coli treated with 50 \u03bcg cm\u22123 of Ag -NPs in liquid \nmedium for 4 hours (b). (Sondi and Salopek -Sondi, 2004) . \n \nAg-NPs can be synthesized either by ex situ  synthesis by chemical \nreduction or in situ  with direct contact with bacteria cells (de Azeredo, \n(B) (A) \nIntroduction  \n~ 52 ~ \n 2013) . Both methods include the use of polymer matrices as carriers, \nbiological macromolecules, mesoporous inorganic materials and \nhydrogels. Other  environmentally -friendly appr oaches to obtain Ag -NPs \nhave been proposed (Sharma, Yngar d and Lin, 2009; Rajan, Chandran, \nHarper, Yun and Kalaichelvan, 2015) . Extracts of Skimmia laureola have \nbeen used by Ahmed et al to synthesize Ag -NPs (Ahmed, Murtaza, \nMehmood and Bhatti, 2015) . Authors reported that the obtained spherical \nnanoparticles showed around 40 nm diameter and AM activity against \nStaphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa \nand Escherichia coli.  \nWhen Ag -NPs are immobilized in polymer matrices, they can display their \nAM activity by the release of metal ions due to the high water sorption \ncreated by the hydrophilic character of some biopolymers. The moisture \nsensitivity and the associated plasticizi ng effect due to the water sorption \ninduce the uncontrolled release of immobilized nanoparticles besides the \noxidation of silver, releasing gradually silver ions (Llorens, Lloret, Picouet, \nTrbojevich and Fernandez, 2012) . Echegoyen and Ner\u00edn studied the \nrelease of Ag -NPs incorporated into polyolefins in two food simulants: \nethano l 50 % (v/v) and acetic acid 3 % (v/v) at two testing conditions: 40 \n\u00b0C for 10 days and 70 \u00b0C for 2 hours in three cycles (Echegoyen and \nNer\u00edn, 2013) . Results showed that the overall migration of silver under \nthese conditions was far below  the limits stated by the European \nlegislation in all cases ensuring the possibilities of these formulations with \nAg-NPs in food packaging applications.  \n \n \n \n \nIntroduction  \n~ 53 ~ \n 3.3. Nanocomposites in food packaging  \nThe use of nanocomposites is gaining some space in the food and \nbeverage packaging market, although it is not yet widely introduced by the \nincrease in costs of the final material and the strict legislative requirements \nregarding the use of materials in the nanoscale in food applications. \nResearch is raising fast in this area and Table I. 7 summarizes some \nexamples of nanocomposites in food packaging applications.  \nThe use of nanocomposites in food packaging materials has resulted in \nimproving some of their key properties, such as strength and flexibility, \nbarrier to gases, moisture stability and higher resistance to heat and cold \n(Restuccia  et al , 2010; Cushen, Kerry, Morris, Cruz -Romero and \nCummins, 2012) . For example, the addition of low amounts of metal \nnanoparticles or nanofillers to PLA matrices results in improvements in \nthe intrinsic poor mechanical resistance, thermal, and gas barrier \nproperties of this biopolymer. These are ess ential characteristics for \npackaging materials and have joined to key properties of PLA, including \nthermoplasticity, high transparency and biocompatibility, for its use as a \nvaluable and sustainable packaging material (Ara\u00fajo, Botelho, Oliveira and \nMachado, 2014) .  \nIn general terms, the studies based on the use of PLA with nanofillers \nshowed the clear increase in toughness and tensile strength of its \nnanocomposites after the addition of nanoclays and/or metal \nnanoparticles. For example, tensile properties of PLA-based \nnanocomposites can be improved with the addition of C30B at different \nconcentrations.  The increase in their elastic modulus and tensile strength \ncompared with the unfilled PLA was around 40 % and 50 % respectively. \nJollands and Gupta reported tha t the elastic modulus was around 4200 \nMPa for unfilled PLA and 5900 MPa for PLA with 4 wt% of C30B, while \nIntroduction  \n~ 54 ~ \n tensile strength was 32 MPa and 59 MPa respectively (Jollands and Gupta, \n2010) . Fukushima et al. also reported that the highest thermo -mechanical \nand mechani cal improvements in PLA matrices were obtained upon the \naddition of 10 wt% of nanoclay, and they are associated with the good \ndispersion level observed by using w ide angle X -ray scattering (WAXS)  \nand to the high clay content  (Fukushima, Tabuani, Arena, Gennari and \nCamino, 2013) . \n \nIntroduction  \n~ 55 ~ \n Table I. 7.

(Fortunati  et al, 2015)  \n(Not reported, N.R.)  \nIntroduction  \n~ 57 ~ \n PLA-based nanocomposites with D43B showed higher thermal stability \nthan those with C15A and C30B after thermo -oxidative degradation \nexperiments due to the hydrophobic character caused by the aromatic ring \nin the D43B structure (Ara\u00fajo, Botelho, Oliveira and Macha do, 2014) . \nPLA is a hydrophobic polymer due to the presence of methyl groups and \nthe D43B can be easily dispersed into the polymer structure. Moreover, \nthe ability of D43B to absorb moisture is lower than in the cases of C15A \nand C30B, retarding the PLA  hydrolysis.  \nIn general terms, gas barrier properties can be greatly improved with the \ninclusion of particulate nanomaterials into polymer matrices. The \nmechanism for this increase in barrier to gases is based on the higher \ntortuosity of the path to be fol lowed by gas molecules in the presence of \nnanoparticles.  \nCarboxy(methylcellulose) films reinforced with MMT improved \nsignificantly their barrier properties to oxygen (around 50 %). This effect \nwas due to the high degree of exfoliation/intercalation reached  in these \nnanocomposites and the possible interactions between the polymer and \nthe nanoclay (Quilaqueo Guti\u00e9rrez, Echeverr\u00eda, Ihl, Bifani and Mauri, \n2012) . \n \n3.3.1.   Preparation and processing  \nProcessing techniques for nanocomposites should be optimized to obtain \nwell-dispersed nanoparticles with high structural integrity and to minimize \ntheir adverse effects to the polymer matrix, such as their possible \ndegradation at high temperatures.  \nNanocomposites are usually obtained by using three main techniques : (i) \nin-situ intercalation, where the layered silicates are swollen in a monomer \nsolution before polymerization; (ii) solvent intercalation, consisting of \nIntroduction  \n~ 58 ~ \n swelling the layered silicates in a suitable solvent to promote the diffusion \nof the macromolecular chains in th e clay galleries; and (iii) melt -\nintercalation, where usual polymer processing in the molten state, such as \nextrusion, are used. Other techniques, such as electrospinning (Ghorani \nand Tucker, 2015)  and electrospraying (Tapia -Hern\u00e1ndez  et al, 2015)  have \nbeen recently proposed for the preparation of homogeneous nano -\nbiocomposites. The use of supercriti cal conditions, such as those offered \nby supercritical CO 2 as blowing agent to obtain PLA -based foams with \nC30B has been also reported (Keshtkar, Nofar, Park and Carreau, 2014) . \nYang et al used supercritic al CO 2 to pre -disperse commercial organic \nMMTs with further solvent mixing with PS to form nanocomposites with \nsignificant dispersion and interfacial enhancement (Yang, Manitiu, Kriegel \nand Kannan, 2014) . X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) results showed that \nnanocomposites with C10A and C20A increased the interlayer spacing of \nthese nanoclays. Nanocomposites with C10A showed diffraction values 2\u03b8 \n= 2.4 \u00b0 corresponding to an increase in the interlayer spacing from 1.05 to \n2.68 nm and nanocomposites with C20A experienced an increase from \n1.77 to 2.68 nm, suggesting that the polymer chains had been intercalated \ninto the clay galleries.  \nObviously, the melt intercalation process is highly preferred for food \npackaging producers since there is no need of organic solvents and the \nproduction can be easily scaled -up to industry.  \n \n4. Active Nanocomposites  \nActiv e nanocomposites are particularly useful in emerging technologies in \nfood packaging due to their improved structural integrity and barrier \nproperties by the addition of nanomaterials (either nanoclays or metal \nIntroduction  \n~ 59 ~ \n nanoparticles), and the increase in AM and/or AO properties in most \ncases by the action of active additives and/or the own nanofiller. \nNevertheless, the selection of the most adequate AM and/or AO agent to \nbe combined with nanofillers is often a complex task by the lack of \ncompatibility of many active  compounds with some polymer matrices or \nby the poor heat resistance of active agents, polymers or nanofillers \nhampering their stability during processing.  \nThe effect of active nanocomposites in direct contact with food depends \non the specific activity of each active agent against spoilage \nmicroorganisms and/or oxidation processes, besides the nanofiller and \nthe polymer as well as other additives, such as plasticizers (Rhim and Ng, \n2007) . In this se nse, the polymer matrix plays the most important role in \nregulating the action of additives and nanofillers by controlling the particle \nrelease or the homogeneous distribution of nanofillers.  \nMuch research is currently ongoing in this area by evaluating th e \npossibility to mix different types of nanofillers (nanoclays, nanocelluloses, \nAg-NPs, etc.) with AM and/or AO additives in conventional plastics or \nbioplastics. EOs obtained from rosemary (Abdollahi, Rezaei and Farzi,  \n2012; Gorrasi, 2015) , clove ,cumin, caraway, marjoram, cinnamon and \ncoriander (Alboofetileh, Rezaei, Hosseini and Abdollahi, 2014)  or Zat aria \nmultiflora Boiss (Shojaee -Aliabadi  et al, 2014)  have shown promising \npossibilities in active nanocomposites. The main compounds of many \nEOs, such as \u03b1-tocopherol  (Dias  et al, 2014)  and hydroxytyrosol  (Beltr\u00e1n,  \nValente, Jim\u00e9nez and Garrig\u00f3s, 2014)  as well as plant extracts, such as \npomegranate rind powder extract (Qin et al, 2015)  or alcoholic extracts of \nred propolis (Costa, Druzian, Machado, De Souza and Guimaraes, 2014) , \nplay an important role in novel active nanocomposites. Table I. 8 shows  \nthe comparison between two active nanocomposites obtained by solvent \nIntroduction  \n~ 60 ~ \n casting and based on edible films with different nanofillers \n(nanocr ystalline cellulose (CNC) and MMT) with two different EOs, \nsavory (S -EO) and Zataria multiflora Boiss (ZMB -EO). Results suggested \nthat mechanical properties were largely influenced by the amount and kind \nof clay. However, the WVP values showed different be haviour depending \non the active component used in each formulation. In the presence of \nZMB -EO, WVP values clearly decreased and this result was related to the \nhydrophobic nature of the EO, which affects the \nhydrophilic/hydrophobic character of films and in creases the tortuosity of \nthe polymer internal structure. In addition, the presence of low amounts \nof the EO likely changes the hydrogen -bonding network within the \npolymer structure and allows better intercalation of \u03ba -carragenan \nmolecules into the silicat e galleries in MMT nanocomposites. On the \nother hand, S -EO in active nanocomposites based on agar film solutions \nresulted in significant increases in the WVP due to the formation of cracks \nor fractures in the nanocomposite structure enhancing the diffusion  of \nmoisture molecules through the films and thereby increasing the WVP \nvalues.  \nNanocomposites with metal nanoparticles are gaining some space in active \npackaging, since they could play a double role, as nanofillers (increasing \nmechanical and barrier prope rties) and active agents with AM \nperformance. Silver, gold and TiO 2 nanoparticles (Busolo, Fernandez, \nOcio and Lagaron, 2010; Bodaghi, Mostofi, Oromiehie, Ghanbarzadeh \nand Hagh, 2015; Mihaly Cozmuta  et al, 2015; Pagno  et al, 2015)  have been \nproposed in active formulations and will be briefly disc ussed below.  \nFor example, gelatin -based AM films  with Ag -NPs and C30B were \nproduced and characterized (Kanmani and Rhim, 2014a) . The AM activity \nwas measured by the agar diffusion and the colony count methods. \nIntroduction  \n~ 61 ~ \n Results show ed that nanocomposites with Ag -NPs and C30B exhibited \ndifferent AM activity against Gram -positive bacteria. While the strong \naction of Ag -NPs is well known, in the case of C30B the AM effect is \nmainly due to the strong activity of the organic tallow used i n the \nmodification of the native MMT. The combination of C30B and Ag -NPs \ninto gelatin films showed their synergic effect against Listeria monocytogenes . \nThe TS of the AM nanocomposite with C30B and Ag -NPs (20.8 \u00b1 3.1 \nMPa) and the nanocomposite with only C3 0B (19.5 \u00b1 4.3 MPa) showed \nslight increase when compared to the unfilled film (15.5 \u00b1 3.9 MPa). \nHowever, no increase was observed in the film with only Ag -NPs (15.3 \u00b1 \n3.5 MPa). Similar increases in TS of the active nanocomposite films by the \naddition of na noclays, such as MMT, have been frequently observed with \nother biopolymer matrices such as \u03ba -carrageenan (Rhim and Wang, 2014) . \nLavorgna et al synthesized AM nanocomposites by loading chitosan with \nAg-MMT nanoparticles by replacing Na+ ions in nati ve MMT with Ag \nions by exchange reactions (Lavorgna  et al, 2014) . The Ag -MMT \nnanocomposites were submitted to  analysis with XRD and X -Ray \nPhotoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) to have a deep understanding of their \nchemical structure. The main diffraction peaks assigned to the MMT were \nmodified in terms of shape and intensity and an additional peak appeared \nin Ag -NPs, corresponding to the (1 1 1) plane reflection of silver. In \naddition, the successful intercalation and the interaction between chitosan \nand Ag -NPs led to the enhancement of the thermal stability of active \nnanocomposites with clear improvement of their TS, mainly due to the \nbetter load transfer between matrix and fillers. AM tests were performed \nand results showed that a significant delay in microbial growth was \nobserved after 24 hours with the active nanocomposites.  \nIntroduction  \n~ 62 ~ \n Munteanu et al studied t he antibacterial property of Ag -NPs and the AO \nactivity of Vitamin E when they were combined within PLA nanofibers \nvia electrospinning (Munteanu, Aytac, Pricope, Uyar and Vasile, 2014) . \nResults showed strong AM effect against Escherichia coli , Listeria \nmonocytogenes  and Salmonella typ hymurium , and the AO activity was \ndetermined as 94 % by using the DPPH method.  \nOther studies showed that carvacrol and thymol can be also incorporated \nas active additives into polymer nanocomposites to enhance their AM \nand/or AO performance (Tun\u00e7 and Duman, 2011; Efrati  et al, 2014; \nShemesh, Krepker , et al , 2015; Tawakkal, Cran and B igger, 2016) . P\u00e9rez et \nal reported that LDPE -based films with Nanomer\u00ae I44P and carvacrol at \n5 and 10 wt% produc ed an increase in the interlayer spacing favoured by \nthe addition of carvacrol. The addition of the nanoclay improved the \ncrystallinity and reduced the permeability to oxygen. Similar results were \nobtained by (Shemesh, Goldman , et al , 2015) . In this study, authors  \nreported a new approach to use MMTs and OMMTs, as active carriers for \ncarvacrol, aiming to minimise its loss throughout the polymer \ncompounding. Different nanoclays were pre -treated with carvacrol, \nresulting in the intercalation of molecules between the c lay galleries, \nenhancing the carvacrol thermal stability. The active nanocomposites \nexhibited excellent and prolonged AM activity against Escherichia coli  \ncompared with binary LDPE/carvacrol films.  \nIntroduction  \n~ 63 ~ \n Table I. 8.

End-of-life for active nanocomposites  \nPolymer degradation could  induce changes in polymer properties due to \nchemical, physical or biological reactions resulting in bond scission and \nsubsequent chemical transformations. These structural modifications \ncould induce changes in the material properties, such as mechanical, \noptical or electrical characteristics, erosion, discoloration, phase separation \nor delamination, chemical transformations and formation of new \nfunctional groups (Shah, Hasan, Hameed and Ahmed, 2008) . \nBiodegrada ble polymers should be decomposed in Nature by the action of \nmicroorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and algae, in aerobic or anaerobic \nconditions but these processes could vary considerably depending on the \nenvironment where they take place, since  the mi croorganisms responsible \nfor the degradation differ from each other and they have their own \noptimal growth conditions (e.g. industrial composting plants, soil, fresh \nwater, marine water). These microorganisms are able to produce changes \nin the chemical str ucture of biodegradable polymers by reducing the long \nchains into simple chemical substances like water and CO 2 during aerobic \nbiodegradation; besides minerals with formation of other intermediate \nproducts like biomass and humic materials or water, methane and CO 2 \nduring anaerobic biodegradation (UNE -EN_13432, 2000; Shah, Hasan, \nHameed and Ahmed, 2008; Vaverkov\u00e1, Toman, Adamcov\u00e1 and \nKotovicov\u00e1, 2012; Ar a\u00fajo, Botelho, Oliveira and Machado, 2014) . \nThe polymer characteristics, mainly mobility, tacticity, crystallinity, molar \nmass, type of functional groups and substituents present in their structure, \nas well as the presence of plasticizers and other additives also play an \nimportant role in the degradation rate and mechanisms (Shah, Hasan, \nHameed and Ahmed, 2008) . This process can be evaluated under aerobic \nIntroduction  \n~ 65 ~ \n or anaerobic conditions by International standard methods (UNE -\nEN_13432, 2000) . \nBiodegradation is also associated with chemical deterioration occurring in \ntwo steps (Shah, Hasan, Hameed and Ahmed, 2008) .: \ni. Fragmentation of the long polymer chains into lower molar mass \nspecies by means of ei ther abiotic reactions, such as oxidation, \nphotodegradation or hydrolysis, or by microorganisms.  \nii. Bio-assimilation of the polymer fragments by microorganisms \nwith further mineralization.  \nIn the case of nanocomposites, they are also submitted to biodegradation \nprocesses after their shelf-life. Relevant results have been obtained in the \nlast decade showing a remarkable improvement in biodegradability for \nnanocomposites prepared with organica lly modified layered silicates.  \nFukushima et al studied the biodegradation of amorphous PLA and the \ncorresponding nanocomposites prepared with OMMT and modified \nkaolinite by using composting conditions at the laboratory scale at 32 \u00b0C \n(Fukushima, Gim\u00e9nez, Cabedo, Lagar\u00f3n and Feijoo, 2012) . Results \nshowed that the PLA biodegradation rate was significantly enhanced in \nnanocomposites due to the presence of terminal hydroxylated edge groups \nin modified kaolinite which started the heterogeneous hydrolysis of the \nPLA matrix after absorbing water from the composting medium. \nHowever, in the early stages (initial 6 weeks in compost), the presence of \nOMMT retained PLA degra dation, likely due to its higher dispersion level \ninto the polymer matrix as compared to modified kaolinite , causing a high \nbarrier effect of OMMTs layers towards microbial attack to PLA ester \ngroups, as well as reducing the loss of oligomers which could c atalyse \nPLA hydrolysis through chain -end hydroxyl groups.  \nIntroduction  \n~ 66 ~ \n Disintegration under composting conditions at the laboratory scale for \nnanocomposite films based on PLA -PHB blends and CNC was also \nreported (Arrieta, Fortunati , et al , 2014) . The addition of CNC to PLA \nincreased the disintegration rate in composting conditions. Authors also \nreported that the disintegrability degree values could fit to the Boltzmann \nequation permitting the theoretical prediction of the half -life in \ndisintegration processes for biopolymers.  \n \n4.2. Risk assessment and migration in active nanocomposites  \nThe high surface -to-volume ratio and reactivity of nanofillers provide \nnanocomposites with enhanced properties and different migration levels. \nThese effects and the presence of materials in the nanoscale in \nformulations intended to be in direct contact with food raise some \npotential health and environmental risks to be studied before using these \nactive nanocomposites at the industrial scale (Sanchez -Garcia, Lopez -\nRubio  and Lagaron, 2010) . \nThe potential toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of some \nnanofillers have been put under discussion. The main concerns over the \nrisks associated with the use of nanocomposites in food packaging are \nbased on the lack of suffi cient knowledge about nanofillers and the \nsignificance of their interaction at the cellular and molecular level in the \nhuman body (Huang, Li and Zhou, 2015) . The evaluation of potential \nrisks should be based on considering the nanomaterials properties and \ntheir transfer rate through cell walls. No migration of nanofillers should \nbe expected in normal cases, but poor characteristics of packaging \nmaterials and the subsequent ingestion of food previously in contact with \nnanocomposites can be con sidered as a potential exposure route (Huang, \nIntroduction  \n~ 67 ~ \n Li and Zhou, 2015) . Consequently, the investigation of the possibility to \napply nanomaterials in food packaging and clear assessment of the safety \nof these materials is necessary to permit the co mmercial distribution of \nactive nanocomposites. The main studies should focus on migration \nanalysis under controlled conditions to determine the real possibilities of \nnanomaterials to be considered a real hazard in food packaging.  \nMigration is the result o f the diffusion, dissolution and equilibrium \nprocesses involving the mass transfer of low molecular weight compounds \ninitially present in the packaging material into food samples or food \nsimulants (Manzanarez -L\u00f3pez, Soto -Valdez, Auras and Peralta, 2011) . \nSeveral factors of the migrant compound, such as the original \nconcentration, partic le size, molecular weight, solubility and diffusivity of \nthe specific substance in the polymer, as well as the pH value, \ntemperature, polymer structure and viscosity, mechanical stress, contact \ntime, and food composition, are the main controlling parameter s in \nmigration studies (Song, Li, Lin, Wu and Chen, 2011) . \nIt has been stated that migration rates depend on mass transport \nparameters and the thermodynamic equilibrium between materials and \nfood (Torres, Romero,  Macan, Guarda and Galotto, 2014) . Many factors \nare essential to estimate the magnitude of the migration process from \npackaging films into food or food simulants and to know the \nconcentration change of migrating species with time. The key point in \ndesig ning a specific migration model in food contact materials is the \ndetermination of two fundamental parameters, the diffusion and partition \ncoefficients which are specific for each system. In most cases, the \nmigration of a particular substance from polymer f ilms is controlled by the \nmolecular diffusion of the migrant through the polymer internal structure, \nIntroduction  \n~ 68 ~ \n which can be described by the Fick\u2019s second law (Po\u00e7as, Oliveira, \nBrandsch and Hogg, 2012; Huang, Li and Zhou, 2015)  \n                                                                                 (I.1) \nwhere Cp refers to the concentration of the migrant in the material at time \nt and position x, and D is the diffusion coefficient which measures the \nrate at which the diffusion process occurs. D could be either a constant or \na concentration -dependent value and characterizes the migration kinetics, \nas the rate at which the transferred substances move through the system.  \nActive nanocomposites can be used in packaging applications as two -\ndimensional  delivery systems based on the release of active additives to \nextend the shelf-life of food products by their action against \nmicroorganisms and oxidative degradation processes. Indeed, the main \nrole of active packaging materials is the release of functiona l additives \nonto the food surfaces in a controlled and systematic process, depending \non the consumer\u2019s nutritional needs and tastes, including mineral, \nprobiotics, vitamins, phytochemicals, oils and other active agents.  \nMigration tests in food contact mate rials should cover all those \nrequirements established by the EU Regulation No 10/2011 on plastic \nmaterials in contact with foodstuff. Although the best approach to test \nmigration is to work with real food matrices, it is not often possible by the \ncomplex c ompositions of most foodstuffs resulting in non -reliable, \ntedious and time -consuming procedures. The current legislation marks the \nvalid route to assess the mass transport processes by evaluating the overall \nand specific migration of targeted substances us ing food simulants \n(Commission_Regulation/(EU)/No -10/2011; Huang, Li and Zhou, \n2015) . Table I. 9 shows the food simulants which are selected as model \nsystems according to the current legislation.  \u086f\u08d4\u0896\n\u089a\u08d4=\u0870\u08d4\u0adb\u086f\u0896\n\u089e\u08d4\u0adb \nIntroduction  \n~ 69 ~ \n At the end of the contact period and depending on the selected food \nsimulant, accurate analytica l methods should be applied to determine the \nprecise amount of migrant in contact with food under the testing \nconditions. It is necessary to identify and determine the target substance(s) \nin the food or food simulants to estimate the specific migration lev el. \nHowever, no standardized analytical methods have been proposed up to \nnow to identify and determine nanoparticles and/or active additives in \nfood simulants.  \n \nTable I. 9. Food simulants established by EU Regulation No 10/2011.  \nFood Simulant  Abbreviation  \nEthanol 10 % (v/v)  A \nAcetic acid 3 % (w/v)  B \nEthanol 20 % (v/v)  C \nEthanol 50 % (v/v)  D1 \nVegetable Oil  D2 \nPoly(2.6 -diphenyl -p-phenylene oxide), also known as MPPO and \nTENAX\u00ae  E \n \nChromatography has been classically used for identification and \nquantification of migrated compounds in passive packaging materials, \nparticularly for common additives, such as plasticizers or colourants. \nRecent studies have proposed the use of different ch romatographic \ntechniques to evaluate the migration of active agents, such as gas \nchromatography -flame ionization detector (GC -FID) (Kuorwel, Cran, \nSonneveld, Miltz and Bigger, 2013; Muriel -Galet, Cran, Bigger, \nHern\u00e1ndez -Mu\u00f1oz and Gavara, 2015) , gas chromat ography \u2013mass \nspectrometry ( GC/MS ) (Efrati  et al, 2014)  or high performance liquid \nchromatography -UV detection (H PLC-UV) (Muriel -Galet, Cran, Bigger, \nHern\u00e1ndez -Mu\u00f1oz and Gavara, 2015) . \nIntroduction  \n~ 70 ~ \n In most cases, a previous step to chromatographic analysis involves the \npreparation of an appropriate sample based on analytical procedures to \nachieve a concentration and/or isolation of analytes by using sample \npreparation techniques, such as solid phase extraction (SPE) (Ridgway, \nLalljie and Smith, 2007; Vi\u00f1as and Campillo, 2014) . \nInductively coupled plasma with different detectors, such as mass \nspectrometry (ICP -MS), atomic emission spectrometry (ICP -AES) and \noptical emission spectrometry (ICP -OES) can be also used in quantitative \nanalysis of potentially migrating nanofillers. Thes e techniques are highly \nselective, sensitive and accurate, making them the most efficient in \ndetermining trace metal ions, such as those present in nanofillers and \nnanocomposites intended for the use in food packaging. For example, \nLavorgna et al quantifie d the concentration of silver released in aqueous \nsolutions at RT from multifunctional active nanocomposites based on \nchitosan with silver -MMT by using ICP -MS (Lavorgna  et al, 2014) . Artiega \net al also used this technique to evaluate the  Ag-NPs migration from \ncommercial food containers. Results demonstrated that the amount of \nsilver migrated increased with storag e time and temperature although, in \ngeneral, silver showed a low tendency to migrate into food simulants \n(Artiaga, Ramos, Ramos, C\u00e1mara and G\u00f3mez -G\u00f3mez, 2015) . \n \n5. Legislation  \nThe legislative framework associated to food contact materials includes \nmany regulations, not always applicable in all countries, which have been \ndiscussed and turned on by considering legal and scientific assumptions \napplicable to the formulation, processing and use of materials i ntended to \nIntroduction  \n~ 71 ~ \n be in direct contact with food. The European Union (EU) has made great \neffort s in unifying the legislation of different member countries.  \nTraditional packaging systems intended to come in contact with food \nmust comply with the legislation set up  by the EU and extrapolated to the \nnational level. But, the raising interest in production of active packaging \nsystems has forced the EU and other administrations to set up the \napplicable legislation in food contact materials (Amenta  et al, 2015) . The \ncurrent legislative framework is represented in  Figure I. 18, in particular for \nactive packaging systems (surrounded by green lines).  \nThe Framework Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 refers to all materials in \ncontact with food, but it is mainly focused  on active and intelligent \nmaterials, since it establishes the basic principles that should accomplish \nall materials intended for their use in food packaging \n(Regulation_(EC)/No -1935/2004) . The article 3 indicates:  \n1. Materials and articles, including active and intelligent materials and articles, shall be \nmanufactured in compliance with good manufacturing practice so that, under normal \nor foreseeable conditions of  use, they do not transfer their constituents to food in \nquantities which could:  \na) endanger human health  \nb) bring about an unacceptable change in the composition of the food  \nc) bring about a deterioration in the organoleptic characteristics thereof  \n \n2. The labelling , advertising and presentation of a material or article shall not mislead \nthe consumers.  \n \nThe introduction of active and intelligent food packaging systems, which \nare supposed to interact with food and/or the package headspace, \nrepresents the appearance of  new challenges for the evaluation of their \nsafety and their harmless character to human health. From the beginning \nof the research in active packaging for their possible commercial use it \nwas clear that regulations limiting or even banning migration shoul d be \nchanged to avoid the incorrect use of packaging due to the insufficient \nIntroduction  \n~ 72 ~ \n labelling or non -efficient operation of the packaging materials (Dainelli, \nGontard, Spyropoulos, van de n Beuken and Tobback, 2008) . The \nFramework Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 on materials and articles \nintended to come into contact with food contains some general provisions \non the safety of active and intelligent packaging and sets the framework \nfor the E uropean Food Safety Agency (EFSA) evaluation processes.  \n \nRegulation (EC) 450/2009\nActive and Intelligent materials\nDirective 2007/42/EC\nRegenerated cellulose filmDirective 2005/31/EC\nCeramic articles\nRegulation (UE) 10/2011\nPlastics materials\nRegulation (EC)\n1935/2004Regulation (EC) 2023/2006\nGood manufacturing practiceRegulation (EC) 282/2008\nRecycled plastic materials\nRD 847/2011\nPositive list of permitted substances\nLabelling\nTraceability Declaration of complianceSafeguard measures General requirements\nActive and intelligent\nEvaluation and authorisation of substancesGeneral aspects \n \nFigure I. 18. European legislation in food contact materials and general aspects of the \nFramework Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 on materials and articles intended to come \ninto contact with food and legislation applied to active packaging (surrounded by green \nlines).  \n \nHowever, specific legislation devoted to active and intelligent materials \nwas introduced in 2009. Regulation (EC) No 450/2009 was  published to \ncover this particular situation in the case of materials designed to \nIntroduction  \n~ 73 ~ \n intentionally interact with food. This regulation established specific rules \nfor active and intelligent materials and should be applied in harmonization \nwith the general req uirements established in the Framework Regulation \n(EC) No 1935/2004 (Commission_Regulation/(EC )/No -450/2009) . This \nregulation also mentions that the substances responsible for the active and \nintelligent functions can be either directly incorporated into the packaging \nmaterial or contained in separate containers (e.g. sachets or labels). It also \ndescribes the procedures for the authorization of active substances in the \nEU. The main requirement indicated in this regulation is based on the risk \nassessment that the EFSA should perform to all the active compounds to \nbe proposed for their commercial us e. In addition, a list of substances or \ngroup/combination of them to be used in active and intelligent packaging \nmaterials should be drawn up following the risk assessment of these \nsubstances by the EFSA (Vald\u00e9s, Mellinas, Ramos, Garrig\u00f3s and Jim\u00e9nez, \n2014) . Therefore, only those substances included in the positive list of \nauthorized substances drawn by the EFSA may be used as valid \ncomponents of active and intelligent packaging materials and articles, with \nthe exception of these substances already a uthorized in other EU \nlegislations, such as food additives, flavourings, enzymes, etc (AINIA and \nEOI, 2015) . The list of authorized substances is continuously growing \nafter the positive evaluations by the EFSA, which allows the submission \nof new proposals for active substances, which must be accompanied by a \nrisk assessment study (Restuccia  et al, 2010) . \nAll passive parts of active and intelligent food packaging systems are also \nunder the EU legislation ( Figure I. 18). The Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 \nand subsequent amendments and corrections (the last of them being \nintroduced on February 2015) , stated the specific measures to be taken \ninto account on active packaging systems. This regulation provides th e \nIntroduction  \n~ 74 ~ \n overall migration limits admissible for materials in direct contact with \nfood (10 mg per 1 dm2 of food surface area or 60 mg per kg food) to \nensure the safety of the final material or article. It also establishes the \nspecific migration limits for substan ces incorporated inside the polymer \nmatrix that can be released after the extended contact with food. These \nlimits ensure that the material in contact with food does not pose a risk to \nhuman health. It is indicated that the amount of active substances rele ased \nfrom packaging materials could exceed the overall migration requirements \nindicated in the EU or national legislations if these substances have been \napproved as harmless by the EFSA. The transfer of these active \nsubstances to food should not be include d in the calculation of the overall \nmigration limit (Vald\u00e9s, Mellinas, Ramos, Garrig\u00f3s and Jim\u00e9nez, 2014) . \nOn the other hand , as previously discussed, the growing concern \nassociated with nanotechnologies and the human health has forced the \nlegislative bodies to set up new regulations regarding the safe use of \nnanomaterials in food packaging applications (Bumbudsanpharoke and \nKo, 2015) . The EU proposes the use of the European Food Information \nto Consumers Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 as a guideline and \nreference for nanotechnology applied in food contact materials. These \nguidelin es were published on the provision of pre -packed food \ninformation to consumers on general food labelling and nutrition labelling \n(EFSA, 2011) . The main novelty of this regulation and the application to \nnanomaterials was that all food ingredients with a form of engineered \nnanomaterials must be indicated in the list of i ngredients, warning \nconsumers of their use (Bumbudsanpharoke and Ko, 2015) . \n \n \n \nIntroduction  \n~ 75 ~ \n 6.

Objectives  \nObjetives  \n~ 101 ~ \n The main  objective of the present work is the develop ment and \ncharacterization  of innovative  active systems based on the combination of \ndifferent polymer matrices and additives, to extend  the shelf-life of \npackaged foodstuff. For this purpose , two main research lines are \nproposed: (1) active f ilms based on PP as polymer matrix  widely used in \nfood packaging applications in combination with carvacrol  and/or thymol ; \nand (2) active nanocomposites based on PLA as biopolymer matrix with \nthe addition of thymol and two different nano fillers  (Dellite\u00ae43B nanoclay \nand silver nanoparticles).  \nThis approach would lead to propose the following specific objectives : \ni. Development and characterization (morphological, mechanical, \nthermal and oxygen barrier properties) of active films based on \nPP with carvacrol and /or thymol. The antimicrobial activity of \nthe obtaine d films was evaluated against two typical foodborn e \nbacteria: Staphylococcus aureus  (Gram -positive) and Escherichia coli  \n(Gram -negative). The release of the active additives from PP \nfilms into different a queous and fatty food simulants  was also \ninvestigate d, including kinetic diffusion study and evaluation of \nthe antioxidant activity  of the obtained extracts . Finally, the \nefficiency of the active  films in increasing foo d shelf-life was \nevaluated by their application to two food samples (strawberries \nand sliced bread)  stored at different conditions . \nii. Development of active nanocomposites based on PLA with \nthymol . Two different formulations were proposed  by the \naddition of nanomaterials : \na) PLA/ thymol bio-films  with the addition of a commercial \norgan o-modified montmorillonite (Dellite\u00ae43B, D43B ). A \nfull characterization (morphological, mechanical, thermal, \nObjectives  \n~ 102 ~ \n optical and oxygen barrier properties) of the obtained \nnanocomposites  was performed. Their d isintegration rate \nunder composting conditions; a kinetic release study  of \nthymol into aqueous food simulants ; and their antioxidant \nand antimicrobial activity were also evaluated.  \nb) PLA/ thymol bio-systems with silver nanoparticles  (Ag-NPs) . \nTwo different morphologies  were proposed to evaluate the \neffect of processing on the nanocomposite s properties: films \nand dog -bone bars.  A full characterization (morphological, \nmechanical, thermal, optical , oxygen barrier properties  and \nwater vapour permeability ) of all systems was  carried out. \nDisintegration under composting conditions  was also \ninvestigated. In addition, a kinetic release study  of thymol and \nAg-NPs into aqueous food simulants , as well as the  \nantioxidant and antimicrobial activit ies of films  were \nevaluat ed. Special attention was paid to the antimicrobial \nperformance of f ilms including both active additives, thymol \nand Ag -NPs.  \n \n \n~ 103 ~ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIII. Results  and Discussion  \n \nResults and Discussion  \n~ 105 ~ \n This section  presents and discusses the main results obtained in this work \nfollowing the research lines specified in the previous  section. These results \nare divided in two chapt ers, corresponding to formulations based on PP \nand PLA , respectively:  \n \nChapter 1 : this study is focused on the development of active films with \nantioxidant and antimicrobial performance with PP as a conventional \npolymer matrix and carvacrol and thymol as active natural additives. Films \nwere processed by melt -blending/ compression moulding  and they were \nfurther  characterized in their physico -chemical and mechanical properties, \nwhile their functionality for the intended use in active food packaging was \nalso studied  by different in-vitro tests and by reproduction of their real \nbehaviour on food contact assays.  \nChapter 2 : PLA was used as biopolymer matrix for the development of \nnano composites with antioxidant  and antimicrobial  performance  with \nthymol as active additive and two different  nanofiller s to improve some of \nthe PLA properties : \nSection 2.1: a commercial nanoclay, Dellite\u00ae43B, was added to \nPLA/thymol formulations  to obtain  films which were fully \ncharacterized in their physico -chemical pr operties. Th eir \nfunctionality for active food packaging w as also  studied by using \ndifferent tests. The biodegradable character of the obtained films \nwas also evaluated under  composting conditions.  \nSection 2.2 : silver nanoparticles (Ag -NPs) were used as \nnanofiller s with antimicrobial properties  to obtain d ifferent \nPLA/thymol/Ag -NPs formulations . Films and dog -bone bars \nwere processed by extrusion  and a ll formulations w ere fully \ncharacterized in their pyhysico -chemical properties. T heir \nResults and Discussion  \n~ 106 ~ \n functionality for a ctive food packaging w as also evaluated by \nusing different tests. The biodegradable character of the obtained \nnanocomposites was also evaluated under  composting conditions.  \n \nPart of the experimental work of this doctoral thesis was carried out at \ninternati onal and well -recognised instit utions in the fields of material \nscience and food technology. This work was divided in two different stays \nunder the supervision of:  \n- Prof. Jose Maria Kenny at the Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Perugia , \nTerni (Italy),  Dipartamento di Ingegneria Civile e Ambientale, \nGroup of Scienza e Tecnologia dei Materiali (November -\nDecember 2010 and September -December 2012  for a total time \nof 6 months) . \n- Prof. Joseph Kerry at th e University College Cork, (Ireland), \nDepartment of Food  and Nutritional Sciences, Food Packaging \nGroup (October 2013 -February 2014  for a total time of 5 \nmonths) . \n \nSome of the  results presented in this PhD thesis have been already \npublished or are now under review in  different scientific books and \njournals with  high impact factor in the fields of analytical and food \nchemistry ( Table III. 1 and Table III. 2). Additionally, the obtained results \nwere disseminated by participation in  several international conferences \n(Table III. 3). In particular, six oral communications were presented, three \nof the m invited.

Introduction  \nFood active packaging systems consisting on polymer matrices with the \naddition of compounds with antimicrobial and/or antioxidant properties \nare increasing their use to extend foodstuff shelf-life and while improving \nconsumer\u2019s safety (Vermeiren, Devlieghere, Van Beest, De Kruijf and \nDebevere, 1999; Fern\u00e1ndez, 2000; Appendini and Hotchkiss, 2002; Del \nNobile  et al, 2009) . The migration of active compound s may be achieved \nby direct contact between food and the packaging material or through gas -\nphase diffusion from the inner packaging layer s to food surface (Conte, \nBuonocore, Bevilacqua, Sinigaglia and Del Nobile, 2006; Coma, 2008; \nGemili, Ye menicio\u01e7lu and Altinkaya, 2009; Mastromatteo, Mastromatteo, \nConte and Del Nobile, 2010) . \nFood can be subjected to microbial contamination that is mainly caused \nby bacteria, yeasts and fungi. Many of these microorganisms can cause \nundesirable reactions and can deteriorate organoleptic and nutritional \nproperties of food (Kuorwel, Cran, Sonneveld, Miltz and Bigger, 2 011b) . \nThe most common procedure to incorporate AM agents (most of them \nsynthetic) into food is by direct addition permitting to diminish food \nspoilage by microorganisms. But this strategy has several disadvantages , \nsuch as the rising consumer \u2019s concern s for food s with synthetic additives  \nin their composition, as well as some mistaken procedures in the  addition \nof these agents to the food bulk when spoilage occurs primarily on the \nsurface . The undesirable modification of organoleptic properties is \nanothe r drawback of the use of these strategies in processed food . \nAM packaging is increasing the attention from food industries to protect \ntheir products from microbial contamination (Kuorwel, Cran, Sonneveld, \nMiltz and Bigger, 2013)  due to the increasing consumer demands for \nminim ally processed and preservative -free products (L\u00f3pez, S\u00e1nchez, \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 1  \n~ 116 ~ \n Batlle and Ner\u00edn, 2007a) . Food packaging films allow the controlled \nrelease of AM additives into food in prolonged periods of time (including \nstorage and distribution operations) and limit possible undesirable \nflavours caused by the direct addition of synthetic additives into food \n(Suppakul, Miltz, Sonneveld and Bigger, 2003; Ho Lee, Soon An, Cheol \nLee, Jin Park and Sun Lee, 2004; Suppakul, Miltz, Sonneveld and Bigger, \n2006; L\u00f3pez, S\u00e1nchez, Batlle and Ner\u00edn, 2007a; Peltzer, Wagner and \nJim\u00e9nez, 2 009). \nActive food packaging with AO abilities is also growing as an adequate \nalternative to common procedures oxidation . The addition of AOs \ndirectly to food samples in combination with vacuum or modified \natmosphere  has been proposed as a good possibility to preserve fat food \nfrom fast oxidative degradation  (Lopez -de-Dicastillo  et al, 2011) . In these \nsystems , the AO  additives incorporated directly into polymer matri ces can \nplay a double role: (i) food protection by their release  in controlled \nconditions and rates , avoiding oxidation of fats and pigments (Del Nobile  \net al, 2009) ; and (ii) to protect the polymer from oxidative degradation \nduring processing. In fact, the addition of AOs to polyolefins is a \ncommon practice for food -grade film manufacturing (Tovar, Salafranca, \nSanchez and Nerin, 2005; Sir\u00f3  et al, 2006) . \nThe n ew possibilities offered by the use  of natural additives in food \npackaging have produced a clear increase in the number of studies based \non natural active compounds  wit AM/AO abilities , such as \uf061-tocopherol \n(Barbosa -Pereira  et al, 2013) , aromatic plant extracts (Dopico -Garc\u00eda  et al, \n2011; Lopez -de-Dicastillo  et al, 2011)  and polyphenols extracted from \nnatural oils (Peltzer, Wagner and Jim\u00e9nez, 2009; Park  et al, 2012) . AM/AO \nadditives derived from EOs are perceived by consumers as health y \ncompounds and they have been proposed in the last decade as  potential \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 1  \n~ 117 ~ \n alternatives to synthetic ad ditives , such as BHT  (Valentao  et al, 2002) . \nMany  studies have focused on the AMs present in EOs extracted from \nplants or spices (basil, thyme, oregano, cinnamon, clove, rosemary) \nconsisting on complex mixtures of different biological active compounds \nincluding terpenoids, phenolic acids, esters, aldehydes, ketones and \nalcohols  (Dorman and Deans, 2000) . Extracts derived from herbs and \nEOs contain many natural compounds suc h as thymol, linalool and \ncarvacrol with a broad AM activity against different pathogenic and \nspoilage microorganisms , including Gram -negative (L\u00f3pez, S\u00e1nchez, \nBatlle and Ner\u00edn, 2007b; Suppakul, Son neveld, Bigger and Miltz, 2011a)  \nand Gram -positive species (L\u00f3pez, S\u00e1nchez, Batlle and Ner\u00edn, 2007a; \nGuti\u00e9rrez, Escude ro, Batlle and Ner\u00edn, 2009) ; as well as against yeast \n(Kuorwel, Cran, Sonneveld, Miltz and Bigger, 2011a)  and moulds \n(Rodriguez -Lafuente, Nerin and Batlle, 2010) . Therefore, there is a rising  \ninterest in the evaluation and application of these compounds for \nminimizing the su rface  contamination of food , in particular  meats, fruits \nand vegetables, decreasing the microbial growth rate of microorganisms \nresponsible for food degradation (Appendini and Hotchkiss, 2002; \nLundb\u00e4ck, Hedenqvist, Mattozzi and Gedde, 2006; Sanchez -Garcia, Ocio, \nGimenez and Lagaron, 2008; Persico  et al, 2009; Peltzer, Navarro, L\u00f3pez \nand Jim\u00e9nez, 2010; Suppakul, Sonneveld, Bigger and Miltz, 2011a)  \nCarvacrol and thymol , which are major compounds present in thyme and \noregano EOs (Al-Bandak and Oreopoulou, 2007) , are isomeric phenolic \nmonoterpenes that exhibit a significant antifungal and in vitro  antibacterial \nactivity against several strains (Halliwell , Aeschbach, L\u00f6liger and Aruoma, \n1995) . They  also exhibit high AO activity (Tomaino  et al, 2005)  and are \ngener ally recognized as safe (possess \u201cGRAS\u201d status) (Persico  et al, 2009)  \nand as flavouring substances according to the European Commission \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 1  \n~ 118 ~ \n Decision 2002/113/EC. Their AO activity can be easily evaluated by \nusing diverse methods such as DPPH, a simple, rapid, sensitive, a nd \nreproducible procedure (Ozcelik, Lee and Min, 2003) . The addition of \nboth additives into polymer matri ces might represent an advantage in \nfood applications due to their possible synergistic effect against several \nmicroorganisms  (Lambert, Skandamis, Coote and Nychas, 2001; Guarda, \nRubilar, Miltz and Galotto, 2011) . The use of high initial concentrations of \nthese volatile additives was previously reported, since some loss during \nprocessing was expectable (Sanchez -Garcia, Ocio, Gimenez and Lagaron, \n2008; Del  Nobile  et al, 2009; Persico  et al, 2009; Mascheroni, Guillard, \nGastaldi, Gontard and Chalier, 2011; Tun\u00e7 and Duman, 2011) . \nActive compounds have been usually added to packaging materials by the \nincorporation of their precursor EOs (Salafranca, Pezo and Ner\u00edn, 2009) . \nRodr\u00edguez et al studied the addition of EOs to wax coating s to develop \nAM active packaging materials able to preserve strawberries from \nmicroorganism s contamination by the release of additives from the \ncoating  to food surface  (Rodr\u00edguez , Batlle and Ner\u00edn, 2007) . Authors \nreported that  there was no direct contact between EOs and food , so it was \nconcluded that  the natural volatile compounds (eugenol, carvacrol, \nthymol) present in the headspace packaging  were the main responsible for \nthe inhibition of the pathogen s growth. In other study, carvacrol was \nadded to chitosan -based films for active packaging and their antimicrobial \nefficiency against food spoilage microorganisms was demonstrated by \nusing a headspace chromatographic technique (Kurek, Moundanga, \nFavier, Gali\u0107 and Debeaufort, 2013) . Guti\u00e9rrez et al used a cinnamon -\nbased a ctive material to increase more than 3 times the shelf-life of a \ncomplex bakery product with minimal changes in packaging and no \nResults and Discussion.

In fact, \nflavour is one of the main factors influencing consumer\u2019s food choice \n(Pozo -Bay\u00f3n, Guichard and Cayot, 2006)  and volatile aromatic \ncompounds are important contrib utors to flavour and odour of fruits. As \nan example, t he flavour of strawberries is comprised of a complex mixture \nof esters, aldehydes, alcohols, furans and sulphur compounds , being e sters \nthe main headspace volatiles. The amount of m ethyl esters increase s with \nthe plant maturation, while it does not change significantly for ethyl esters \nduring the fruit growth  stages  (Rizzolo, Gerli, Prinzivalli, Buratti and \nTorreggiani, 2007) . Bread is another example where  more than 540 \ndifferent compounds were described in its complex volatile fraction (Ruiz, \nQuilez, Mestres and Guasch, 2003) , being alcohols, aldehydes, esters, \nketones, acids, pyrazines and  pyrrolines th e major volatile components, \nwhile  furans, hydrocarbons and lactones were also identified (Poinot  et al, \n2007) . \nSolid phase microextraction (SPME) has become one of the preferred \ntechniques in analysis of aroma s and volatile compounds , offering \nsolvent -free, rapid , low-cost and reliable analytical methods with easy \npreparation. SPME  is also sensitive, selective and usually offer s low \ndetection limits (Ho, Wan Aida, Maskat and Osman, 2006) . When used in \nthe sample headspace, HS-SPME is a non -destructive and non -invasive \nmethod that has been used to evaluate volati le and semi -volatile \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 1  \n~ 120 ~ \n compounds released from a great number of foods (Qu\u00edlez, Ruiz and \nRomero, 2006; Poinot  et al, 2007) . \nThe release rate of AOs from packaging material s can be evaluated by \nmigration studies, using aqueous and fatty food simulants and conditions \nspecified in the European food packaging regulations  launched in  2011 \nand later amendments  (Commission_Regulation/(EU)/No -10/2011; \nKuorwel, Cran, Sonneveld, Miltz and Bigger, 2013) . Migration  is the result \nof diffusion, dissolution and equilibrium processes involving the mass \ntransfer of low molecular mass compounds initially present in the package \ninto food sample s or food simulant s; and it is often described by Fick\u2019s \nsecond law (Manzanarez -L\u00f3pez, Soto -Valdez, Auras and Peralta, 2011) . \nChromatographic methods are commonly  used for identification and \nquantification of migrated compounds (Salafranca, Pezo and Ner\u00edn, 2009) , \nconsidering that  concentration and/or isolation of analytes into suitable \nsolvent s should  be performed prior to chromatographic analysis . Some  \nsample preparation and purification techniques , such as SP E, have been \nproposed to improve detection and quantification in the analysis of \nmigrated compounds from polymer matrices (Burman, Albertsson and \nH\u00f6glund, 2005; Ridgway, Lalljie and Smith, 2007) . \nIn spite of the increasing concern on the use of synthetic polymers in \nmassive applications, such as food packaging, due to their poor \nbiodegradability and high permanence in the environment after use, these \nmaterials show many advantages including low cost, good processability \nand excellent mechanical and physical properties. P olyolefin -based films \nhave been proposed for the development of active packaging system s by \nthe combination of the polymer good properties (mechanical, barrier, \noptical and thermal) and the AM/AO effect given by the additives \n(Suppakul, Miltz, Sonn eveld and Bigger, 2006; L\u00f3pez, S\u00e1nchez, Batlle and \nResults and Discussion.

A full \nphysico -chemical characterization of these films was c arried out by \ndetermination of their main thermal, structural, mechanical and functional \nproperties. The release of these compounds from films into different food \nsimulants was also studied; including a kinetics diffusion study and the \nevaluation of the antioxidant efficiency by the DPPH method.  Fast and \nreliable analytical procedures were developed and validated for the analysis \nof the studied AOs in selected food simulants. For aqueous food \nsimulants, SPE followed by GC/MS  analysis was used. Fatty food \nsimulants (isooctane and ethanol 95 % (v/v)) were directly analysed by \nGC/MS  and HPLC -UV, respectively. The AM activity of films was also \nevaluated against two typical food -borne bacteria: Staphylococcus  aureus  \n(Gram -positive) and Escherichia  coli (Gram -negative).  Finally, t he \neffectiveness of the developed active films to increase the post -harvest \nshelf-life of fresh food was evaluated by studying the headspace volatile \ncomposition of two food samples ( sliced bread and strawberries)  by \nheadspace s olid phase microextraction and gas chromatography mass \nspectrometry (HS-SPME -GC/MS ) at controlled conditions. Results were \ncorrelated with the AM activity by visual observation of the fungal growth \nin the studied food . \n \n  \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 1  \n~ 122 ~ \n 2. Experimental  \n2.1.

The AO performance of carvacrol and thymol \nwas studied by determining the oxidation induction parameters  by DSC , \ni.e. oxidation onset temperature, OOT ( \u00b0C) and oxidation induction time, \nOIT ( min) (Posp\u0131\u0301\u0161il et al, 2003; Archodoulaki, L\u00fcftl and Seidler, 2006) . \nOOT is defined as the minimum temperature where oxidation takes place \nin pure oxygen atmosphere. The OIT value is defined as the time to the \nonset of an exothermic oxidat ion peak in oxygen atmosphere and it was \ndetermined as the difference between the time at the intersection between \nthe baseline and the tangent of the exothermic oxidation peak and the \ntime for the gas switching in two different atmospheres: pure oxygen an d \nair. All tests were performed in triplicate for each formulation.  \nOOT (\u00b0C) is a relative measurement of the degree of thermo -oxidative \nstability of the material evaluated at a given heating rate in oxidative \natmosphere (Peltzer and Jim\u00e9nez, 2009) . Samples were  heated up at 10 \u00b0C \nmin-1 under pure oxygen (50 mL min-1) from 30 \u00b0C to the temperature \nwhere the exothermic oxidation peak  was observed .

Samples were taken in triplicate  at 2, 6, 12, 24, \n48 hours and 5, 10 and 15 days . \nThe migration process is described by the diffusion kinetic s of the additive \nthrough the film and it is expressed by the diffusion coefficient, D (m2 s-1) \n(Manzanarez -L\u00f3pez, Soto -Valdez, Auras and Peralta, 2011) . Considering \nthe case of limited packaging, limited food, where migration occur ring \nfrom a limited volume packaging film into a well -mixed limited volume of \nfood, the diffusion coefficients of thymol and carvacrol can be determined \nby using a release kinetic model based in the Fic k\u2019s second law (Equation \n1.2). In this case, the food simulant initially does not contain any migra ting \ncompound , and as migration occurs, the ir concentration increases from \nzero (CF,0) to its equilibrium value (CF,\uf0a5).

An aliquot of 100 \u03bc L of each simulant extract was mixed \nwith 3.9 mL of a methanolic solution of DPPH (23 mg  L-1) in a capped \ncuvette. The mixture was shaken quickly at room temperature and the \nabsorbance of solution s was measured immediately at 517 nm in 1-min \nintervals until the absorbance value was completely stable  (200 min), by \nusing a Biomate -3 Ultraviolet -visible ( UV-Vis) spectrophotometer \n(Thermospectronic, USA).

Antibacterial  activity  \nThe evaluation of the anti bacterial  activity of PP films  containing \ncarvacrol, thymol and  the equimolar mixture of both additives was carried \nout by using two test microorganisms: Escherichia  coli (Gram -negative, \nATCC (American Type Culture Collection) 25922) and Staphylococcus  aureus  \n(Gram -positive, ATCC 6538P). The PP0 sample was also tested as \ncontrol. Overnight cultures of Escherichia  coli and Staphylococcus  aureus  were \ngrown in Tryptic Soy Broth at 35 \u00b0C for 24 h . The strains selection \nrepresented typical spoilage organism groups common ly occurring in food \nproducts.  \nAntibacterial  activity tests were carried out by using the agar disk diffusion \nmethod. Disks cut from films were placed on Petri dishes containing \nMueller -Hinton agar (MHA) supplied by INSULAB S.L., (Valencia, \nSpain), previou sly spread with 0.1 mL of each inoculum. The \nconcentration of bacterial cultures in the inoculum was 106 colony -\nforming unit ( CFU ) per mL, corresponding to the concentration that \ncould be found in contaminated food, and standardized in the McFarland \nscale 0.5, as it has been already proposed  (Suppakul, Sonneveld, Bigger \nand Miltz, 2011b) . The Petri dishes were then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h  \nand t he anti bacterial  activity of each material was evaluated by observing \nthe growth inhibition zone and measuring the diameter (mm) by a ruler. \nThe bacterial growth under the film disks (area of contact with the agar \nResults and Discussion.

Study of the effectiveness of the active films to preserve \nperishable food: shelf -life study  \nFood samples.  Strawberries and sliced bread were purchased from a local \nmarket. Strawberries were selected for this study due to their rapid post -\nharvest deterioration, which constitutes a problem on their commercial \ndistribution. Sliced bread was selected due to the i ncreasing consumer \ndemand for fresh bread with long shelf-life. Damaged, non -uniform, \nunriped or overriped strawberries were removed and the selected fruits \nwere stored for at least 2 h at 3 \u00b0C to ensure their thermal equilibrium \nbefore testing.  \nFood packa ging.  The effectiveness of the developed active films (with \neach additive at 8 wt%  in different samples)  was evaluated by putting \nthem in contact with the above -referred food , which were  appropriately \ncut to be placed on the base of disposable PP Petri dishes (inside \ndimensions: 88 mm diameter x 12 mm high). An additional test was \ncarried out with uncut strawberries which were placed into polyethylene  \nsuitable food container s (250 mL, 4 c m high x 13 cm opening diameter) as \nshown in Figure 1. 3. \nActive films were cut with the appropriate dimensions to match the top of \nthe lid of the used containers in order to release the antimicrobial studied \nagents (carvacrol and thymol) into the packaging headspace. The final \ncontainers were then sealed with \"Parafilm\" to avoid losses of volatile \ncompounds and were incubated at 25 \u00b0C and 50 % RH in a cl imatic \nResults and Discussion.

Experimental assembly used for headspace analysis of whole strawberries by \nHS-SPME.  \nShelf -life study.  The observation of the occurrence of fungal growth  on \nthe studied samples was also performed. In addition, HS-SPME -GC/MS  \nanalysis was carried out for f ood samples (whole strawb erries and sliced \nbread) in direct contact with the PP films . For this purpose, s amples were \nextracted at selected times to determine the headspace composition. \nContainers were sealed and a polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE )/silicone \nseptum was placed on their  top part to allow the insertion of the SPME \nfibre for volatiles extraction ( Figure 1. 3). Samples were then stored in a \nclimatic chamber and tested at different temperatures and days of storage \naccording to the conditions shown in Table 1. 1. 25 \u00b0C and 4  \u00b0C were \nselected to simulate ambient and refrige rated storage conditions, \nrespectively. Three replicates were performed for each food sample and \nday of study.  \nHS-SPME analysis of volatile compounds for food samples was \nperformed by following  a method applied to bread samples (Poinot  et al, \nPP0                      PPT8                   PPC8  \nResults and Discussion.

Fibres were previously  conditioned by foll owing the manufacturer\u2019s \nrecommendations. The needle of the SPME device was inserted into the \ncontainer through the septum and fibre s were  exposed to the food sample \nheadspace for 30 min at room temperature. Fibres were  then retracted \ninto the needle assem bly point , removed from the container, transferred \nto the injection port of the GC unit and immediately desorbed.  \nAnalysis of volatiles produced in the headspace of bread and strawberries \npacked samples  was performed by using a  Perkin Elmer TurboMass Gold \nGC/MS  (Boston, MA, USA) equipped with a split/splitless injector and a \nquadrupole mass spectrometer operating in electronic impact (EI) \nionisation mode (70 eV) . A SPB -5 capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm x \n0.25 \uf06dm; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) was used. The  column \ntemperature was programmed from 40 \u00b0C (hold 10 min) to 120 \u00b0C (hold 1 \nmin) at 5 \u00b0C min-1, to 140 \u00b0C at 2 \u00b0C min-1 (hold 0 min) and to 230 \u00b0C at 5 \n\u00b0C min-1 (hold 8 min). Helium was used as carrier gas at 1 mL min-1 flow \nrate. Ion source and GC/MS tr ansfer line temperatures were 250 and 270 \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 1  \n~ 135 ~ \n \u00b0C, respectively , while the  injector temperature was 270 \u00b0C and time for \nfibre desorption was fixed at 5 min in the splitless mode (1.5 min splitless -\nperiod). After every run, the SPME fibre was conditioned for 30 min at \n270 \u00b0C in the injector of the gas chromatograph followed by a blank \nanalysis to avoid the fibre carryover.  \nIdentification of volatile compounds in strawberries and sliced bread \nheadspace was performed in full scan mode (m/z 30 -550). Carvacrol and \nthymol were identified by using both, the NIST mass spectral library and \ngas chromatographic retention times of standard compounds. The rest of \nvolatiles were tentatively identified by their GC/MS spectra. In this sense, \nthe compounds having \uf0a3 90 % similarit y with spectra in the NIST library \nwere not taken into consideration. Chromatographic responses of \ndetected volatile compounds (peak area counts) were monitored for \ncomparative measurements of each compound in the studied samples.  \n \n2.8.

A significant decrease (p < 0.05) in \nelastic modulus was observed for the materials with additives when \ncompared with PP0, being this effect more pronounced  for PPC8 and \nPPT8 films. A certain increase in elongation at yield for these samples was \nalso observed (p < 0.05). This behaviour could be explained by some \nplasticizing effect caused by the addition of both additives to the polymer \nmatrix resulting in th e increase in ductile properties, which would also \nresult in changes in the materials crystallinity. This behaviour has been \nalso reported for LDPE -based samples with carvacrol (Persico  et al, 2009) . \n \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 1  \n~ 139 ~ \n 3.1.3.  Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA).  \nThe effect of carvacrol and thymo l on the thermal stability of PP films \nwas studied by TGA under nitrogen atmosphere. Figure 1. 6 shows the \nTGA curves obtained for PP0 and PPC samples. As it is well reported for \nPP thermal degradation, a single degradation step was observed for PP0 \nsample (Navarro, Torre, Kenny and Jim\u00e9nez, 2003) . However, samples \nwith carvacrol showed a first degradation step at low temperatures (about \n115 \u00b0C) and a second step corresponding to the thermal degradation of \nthe polymer matrix. The TGA patterns of other formulations were quite \nsimilar in all cases. In this way, the first degradation step observed in \nactive films was associated to the degradation of carvacrol and/or thymol.  \n \nFigure 1. 6. TGA curves obtained for PP0 and formulat ions with carvacrol under nitrogen.  \n \nTherefore, it was possible to determine the remaining amount of additive \nin the polymer matrix after processing. The remaining concentrations \nwere approximately 1, 2 and 3.5 wt% for formulations w here the  initial \namount s were  4, 6 and 8 wt%, respectively.

Chapter 1  \n~ 140 ~ \n gave an indirect confirmation of the presence of both compounds in the \npolymer matrix after processing and consequently their ability to act as \nactive agents in these materials as it has been reported by other authors \n(Persico  et al, 2009) . \nTable 1. 3 summarizes the initial degradation temperature , Ti, determined \nat 5 % of weight loss, and the temperatu re for the maximum rate , Tmax, for \nthe main degradation step, ascribed to the PP thermal degradation. As can \nbe observed , no appreciable differences were observed for T i and T max \nvalues in all samples. These results show that the addition of carvacrol and \nthymol to the PP matrix does not significantly affect the thermal \ndegradation profile in inert atmosphere. However, it is expectable that a \ncertain amount of carvacrol and thymol would be lost during processing, \nsince these materials are submitted to temperatures above the \nvolatilization point of the additives. Therefore, the processing parameters, \nin particular temperature and time , should be optimized to avoid excessive \nevaporati on and therefore the loss of these additives incorporated to PP  \npermitting the permanence of significant amounts of additives in PP \nmatrices  (Dobkowski, 2006) . \n \n3.1.4.  Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) . \nDetermination of thermal parameters in inert atmosphere.  Thermal \nproperties of samples were also studied by DSC , where four parameters \nwere determined: crystallization temperature, T c (\u00b0C); melting \ntemperature, T m (\u00b0C); crystallization enthalpy, \u2206H c (J g-1); and melting \nenthalpy, \u2206H m (J g-1).

Nevertheless, it should \nbe highlighted that the melting enthalpy of the PP0 sample was clearly \nhigher than those obtained for the act ive materials. This observation could \nindicate some decrease in PP  crystallinity caused by the presence of \nadditives. In this sense, crystallinity, \uf063 (%), of samples was calculated \naccording to Equation 1.1.  Results are also shown in Table 1. 3, where a \nhigher value for \uf063 (%) was obtained for PP0. From these results,  it could \nbe concluded that the PP crystallinity decreases significantly with the \naddition  of thymol and carvacrol, confirming the observed changes in the \nmechanical properties where a decrease in the elastic modulus was \nnoticed. This decrease in crystallinity could be due to the interactions \nbetween the polymer matrix and additive molecules in  the PP \nmacromolecular network , in particular by the formation of hydrogen \nbonds between the hydroxyl groups in the additive and the crosslinking \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 1  \n~ 142 ~ \n points in the polymer macrochains with increase in the disorder of the PP \nstructure and consequent decrease in  crystallinity . A similar effect was \nreported for PP with the addition of other antioxidants  (Alin and \nHakkarainen, 2010) . \n \nEvaluation of oxida tion induction parameters (OIT and OOT).  The \nevaluation of the antioxidant performance of carvacrol and thymol in PP \nmatrices  is relevant in this study,  since the se additives are not only \nsupposed to play the role of active additives for food, but also to protect \nthe polymer against  oxidative degradation during processing and further \nuse. The determination of OOT and OIT parameters is considered a \nreliable, simple and fast method for the evaluation of the AOs efficiency \n(Pomerantsev and Rodionova, 2005) . Both parameters correspond to \nrelative measurements of the stability against oxidation of materials  at high \ntemperatures . \nTable 1. 4 shows  the OOT and OIT results  for all the tested materials . The \nonset degradation temperatures for all active materials were significantly \nhigher (at least in 25 \u00b0C) than the OOT obtained for the PP0 sample  (p < \n0.05) . Therefore, it is remarkable that some antioxidant effect in the \nmaterial caused by the presence of the active additives in films  was \nobserved . In particular, the formulations with thymol showed significantly \nhigher values than their coun terparts with carvacrol  (p < 0.05) . Similar \nresults were previously reported for PP  matrices  with \u03b1 -tocopherol and \nhydroxytyrosol, two other natural antioxidants  (Peltzer and Jim\u00e9nez, \n2009) . \n \nResults and Discussion.

For this reason, the evaluation of OIT in this work was carried out \nin two different atmospheres at 200 \u00b0C. This temperature was fixed since \nthese tests require values slightly higher than those obtained for OOT of \nthe pure polymer, and OOT for PP 0 was 195 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. Air was selected \nsince it would represent a situation according to the real processing or \nshelf-life conditions for these materials , while pure oxygen was also used \nsince it would represent the most aggressive conditions for the oxidative \ndegradation. Table 1. 4 shows the results obtain ed for OIT in both \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 1  \n~ 144 ~ \n atmospheres. In the case of pure oxygen, PPT6 and PPT8 films  showed \nhigher efficiency as AOs in such aggressive conditions when compared to \ncarvacrol  (p < 0.05) . This behaviour was also reported by other authors \nwho demonstrated that the AO efficiency of thymol was higher than that \nof carvacrol in sunflower oil samples (Yanishlieva, Marinova, Gordon and \nRaneva, 1999) . In the case of air atmosphere, as expected, OIT values \nwere higher than those obtained in pure oxygen, since the experiment \nunder air is less aggressive to materials  (Riga, Collins and Mlachak, 1998) , \nbut results showed a similar trend since thymol showed higher antioxidant \nperformance than carvacrol.  \nIn all cases, the increase in OOT and OIT values for PP with additives \nshowed certain AO effect after processing  to protect PP from oxidative \ndegradation . These results are an additional confirmation that certain \namounts of thymol and carvacrol still remain ed in all formulations after \nprocessing and they would be able to be released from the material to \nfoodstuff as active additives , since it will be discussed in further sect ions \nof this chapter . Finally, an increase in both parameters was also observed \nwhen the additive concentration increased. So, it can be concluded that \nthe best results for AO performance in these formulations would be \nobtained in those samples with higher  amount of additives , in particular \nthymol.  \n \n3.1.5.  Oxygen Transmission Rate (OTR)  \nBarrier properties to oxygen were studied by the determination of oxygen \ntransmission rate per film thickness ( e), OTR \u2219e. Results are shown in Table \n1.4.

Chapter 1  \n~ 145 ~ \n films could be due to the modification of the polymer matrix structure by \nthe presence of additives, reducing consequently the resistance of films to \noxygen diffusion through them (Sothornvit and Krochta, 2000) . This \nbehaviour could be due to two related causes. On one hand, the increase \nin free volume in the polymer structure caused by the chemical interaction \nbetween polymer chains and additive molecules and, on the other hand, \nthe decrease in the material crystallinity already obse rved by DSC and the \npresence of certain porosity in the films surface observed by SEM \n(Amstrong, 2002) . \n \n3.2. Migration study  \n3.2.1.  Validation of the developed methods  \nThe analytical methods developed in this study for the evaluation of the \nmigration of ca rvacrol and thymol into food simulants were validated by \nassessing the main analytical characteristics: linearity, precision \n(repeatability), detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) limits and \naccuracy (recovery test).  \nLinear ranges were calculated with f ive calibration points, each o f them  in \ntriplicate (0.15 -2.10 mg  kg-1 in dichloromethane for the SPE-GC/MS  \nmethod and aqueous food simulants; 0.15 -4.00 mg  kg-1 for isooctane and \nethanol 95 % (v/v) for direct GC/MS  and HPLC -UV analyses, \nrespectively).  The calculated calibration curves gave an acceptable level of \nlinearity for thymol and carvacrol with determination coefficients ( R2) \nranging between 0.9963 -0.9989, as shown in Table 1. 5. Repeatability was \nevaluated by analysing  three replicates of standard solutions processed in \nthe same day . All methods showed similar results for relative standard \ndeviation (RSD) , lower than 10 %. LOD and LOQ values were \nResults and Discussion.

As can be seen in  Table 1. 5, \nthe lowest values for LOD and LOQ were obtained for thymol by using \nthe HPLC -UV method. On the other hand, carvacrol showed lower \nvalues f or these parameters considering the SPE -GC/MS  method. In \ngeneral terms , the LODs and LOQs values obtained for these active \nadditives  ranged between 0.16 -0.22 mg kg-1 and between 0.50 -0.74 mg kg-\n1, respectively.  \nRecovery tests for the SPE-GC/MS  method were accomplished in \ntriplicate to evaluate accuracy, by spiking aqueous food simulants with \nknown amounts of each additive at three concentration levels (0.03, 0.27 \nand 2.60 mg  kg-1). A working solution containing thymol and carvacrol  \n(4000 mg  kg-1) in me thanol was used. Satisfactory results were obtained \nfor mean recoveries at all the tested levels ( Table 1. 6), ranging from 86.7 -\n108.2 % with RSD values between 2.1 -11.0 %. In conclusion, the results \nobtained in the validation of the analytical  methods developed in this \nstudy can be  considered accep table for the determination of the migration \nof carvacrol and thymol in aqueous and fatty food simulants.  \n \nResults and Discussion.

Release of active  additives into food simulants  \nBoth active additives were readily released into aqueous and fatty food \nsimulants from all PP films ( Table 1. 7). Similar behaviour was observed \nfor thymol and carvacrol migration under the same experimental \nconditions. However, thymol showed a trend to higher migration than \ncarvacrol in distilled wate r. The amount of active additives released into \nfatty food simulants from PP -based films with 8 wt% thymol (PPT8) and \ncarvacrol (PPC8) was significantly higher than those obtained in the \naqueous simulants (p < 0.05) . In particular, the highest migration le vels \nwere obtained into isooctane at 20 \u00b0C for 2 days compared with the rest \nof simulants tested ( 40 \u00b0C and 10 days ). This behaviour might result from \nthe higher affinity of PP to non -polar liquids, such as isooctane , than to \nthe highly polar  solvents, suc h as ethanol 95  % (v/v)  or other polar food \nsimulants . Therefore the extraction of additives becomes an issue in \nisooctane, showing a diffusion behaviour rather than migration, ultimately \nleading to high migration values  (Torres, Romero, Macan, Guarda and \nGalotto, 2014) . \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 1  \n~ 149 ~ \n The higher migration observed for thymol and carvacrol into fatty food \nsimulants could be also attributed to two factors: the high er solubility of \nthe migrated active additives into these solvents and the phenomenon of \nswelling of the polymer matrix when the films come into contact with \nfatty food  simulants (Suppakul, Sonneveld, Bigger and Miltz, 2011a) . \nTehrany et al indicated that polarity can be a predominant controlling \nfactor in migration kinetics and, consequently,  a highly polar simulant \nshould have a great effect on sorption  of additives into polymer matrices  \n(Tehrany, Mouawad and Desobry, 2007) . In this sense, partitioning \ndepends on the polarity and solubility of the migrant in the food simulant. \nIn our case, the higher release of carvacrol and thymol into ethanol 95 % \n(v/v) rather than ethanol 10 % (v/v)  showed the influence of the simulant \npolarity and the solubility  of thymol and carvacrol  in the migration \nphenomenon . It can be also assumed that certain amount of simulant s will \npenetrate into the matrix, enhancing the mobility of the target active \nadditives inside the polymer chain s, which could promote faster dif fusion \nand in consequence higher migration. This behaviour has been also \nsuggested in previous studies of the migration of some active compounds \nwith antioxidant properties from polyolefins into fatty food simulants \n(Haider and Karlsson, 2000; Tovar, Salafranca, Sanchez and Nerin, 2005; \nPeltzer, Wagner and Jim\u00e9nez, 2009; Kuorwel, Cran, Sonneveld, Miltz and \nBigger, 2013) . \nResults and Discussion.

The migration of these additives  \ninto the  tested  simulants might be due mainly to two factors: the \nhydrophilic character of these  additives described in literature (Peltzer, \nWagner and Jim\u00e9nez, 2009) ; and the small size of the ir molecules , \npermitting  faster diffusion since the diffusion rate is governed by the \nmobility of the additives molecules which is determined by the ir size and \ngeometry (Haider and Karlsson, 2000; Reynier, Dole, Humbel and \nFeigenbaum, 2001) . This behaviour was also observed by Mastromatteo et \nal who reported that the release of thymol from a swelling homogeneous \npolymeric network could be viewed as the result of the  diffusion from the \nouter water solution into the polymer matrix, the macromolecular matrix \nrelaxation and the diffusion of the active compound from the swollen \npolymeric network into the outer water solution (Mastromatteo, Barbuzzi, \nConte and Del Nobile, 2009) . The difference in polarity between the polar \nmigrated substances and the non -polar polymer  should be also taken into \naccount . \n \n3.2.3.

The \nantioxidant activity of these compounds depends not only on the ir \nstructure but also on many other factors, such as their concentration, \ntemperature, light, simulant type and physical parameters inherent to the \nparticular food to be put in contact with these compounds (e.g. pH).  \nResults and Discussion.

Chapter 1  \n~ 154 ~ \n compounds with sterically -hindered hydroxyl group s, such as BHT, have \nbeen also reported to possess high antioxidant activity (Mastelic  et al, \n2008) . \nThe inhibition values obtained in DPPH tests were correlated with the \namount of thymol and carvacrol released from films ( Table 1. 7). As \npreviously discussed, t he highest amount of released additives was \nobserved into fatty food simulants  and no signi \ufb01cant differences between \nisooctane and ethanol 95  % (v/v)  were observed  for different \nformulations at p < 0.05  significance level  (Figure 1. 7). These results \nsuggest that a considerable amount of both additives  remain in the \npolymer matrix after processing and consequently could act as active \nagents in these PP-based formulations . In this sense, the PP films \nobtained  in this study could be used as AO films for food packaging \napplications in order to  extend the shelf-life of food products, retarding \noxidation processes . \nFinally, the study of the combined activity of carvacrol and thymol \nintroduced in the matrix  at 4 wt% of each compound (PPTC8) showed \nsome additive effect between them since similar results were obtained fo r \nsamples with 8  wt% of each compound (PPC8 and PPT8) separately. This \neffect was more evident into fatty food simulants  (Figure 1. 7). \n \n3.2.4.

Chapter 1  \n~ 157 ~ \n In a first approach, a significantly higher amount of migrated analytes \noccur red into isooctane (see \u03b1 values in Table 1. 8). Furthermore, for this \nsimulant, at t > 120 h, the equilibrium was not well defined and  in the case \nof PPT8 in isooctane the release values ob tained at the end of the \nexperiment were close to 100 % . This result can be explained by the \n\u201cswelling -controlled\u201d model  already proposed by other authors  (Suppakul, \nSonneveld, Bigger and Miltz,  2011a) . \nAccording to this model, simulant s would  firstly penetrate into the \npolymer matrix to dissolve the active agents , thereby enabling their \nsubsequent release. Indeed, it could be expected that the simulant uptake \nwould cause polymer swelling. The  migration of thymol and carvacrol is \nthus expected to increase with an increase in the simulant penetration into \nthe PP -based  film, reaching a plateau when the matrix is saturated with \nthe simulant. However, many interactions take place during the migrati on \nof species from polymers into liquids. Moreover, it has been pointed out \nthat a time -dependent relaxation process could occur as the result of the \nswelling that takes place during the diffusion of the liquid through the \npolymer. Consequently , release rates change continuously and the accurate \nmathematical analysis of the migration is difficult. The rapid diffusion of \nsimulant molecules through the polymer bulk facilitates further \npenetration by the plasticization of the polymer matrix  caused by the \npresence of additives , until a plateau is reached. As pointed out before, fo r \nisooctane an increase of migration after reaching the equilibrium was \nobserved for both active additives at 360 h. This could be due to a \ncombination of temperature and lo nger time s in which the PP -based  films \nwere penetrated by isooctane producing the increase on the release d \namount of additives . It can be also assumed that  the sorption of isooctane \nby the PP matrix and the consequent creation of void spaces could favour \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 1  \n~ 158 ~ \n the migration of the phenolic compounds (Manzanarez -L\u00f3pez, Soto -\nValdez, Auras and Pera lta, 2011) . \nThe experimental release data shown in Figure 1. 9 and Figure 1 .10 were \nfurther analysed in terms of a diffusion model in agreement with  Equation \n1.4. However, the use of this equation to compute diffusion coefficients \nneeds the previous knowledge of the partition values. According to the \nprevious discussion , it can be assumed that the amount of thymol or \ncarvacrol release d from the matrix  can be estimated as being constant \nafter 120 h, and once Equation 1.4 can only be applied to MF,t/MP,0 < 0.6;  \nthe use of this equation do not interfere with the assumed  effect of the \nswelling -process in the mass transport by diffusion. Under these \ncircumstances , the release of thymol and carvacrol from PPT8 and PPC8 \nto different simulan ts can be modelled by using Equation  1.6: \n \n                                                                 (1.6.) \nwhere k\u2019 is a constant related to the release rate constant. By fitting \nEquation 1.6 to the experimental data (see solid lines in  Figure 1. 9 and \nFigure 1 .10), the values of MF,\u221e/MP,0 can be obtained and, finally apparent \npartition coefficients (\u03b1 ap) can be calculated through Equation  1.7: \n \n                                                                          (1.7.) \nIt should be stressed that the Equation 1.6 has been selected once \nconsidered the border and limit conditions of the experiments reported in \nthis work, since it describes a first order kinetic process (Reis, Guilherme, \u072f\u0728,\u0750\n\u072f\u0732,\u074b\u0d58 =\u0d6e\u072f\u0728,\u221e\n\u072f\u0732,\u074b\u0d58\u0d72\u0d6b1\u2212\u0741\u2212\u0747\u2032\u0750\u0d6f \n\u072f\u0728,\u221e\u072f\u0732,\u074b\u0d58 =\u07d9\u074c\u073d\n\u0d6b1+\u07d9\u074c\u073d\u0d6f\u0d58  \nResults and Discussion .

As can be seen, the linearity of the \nplot 5.0\n0,, 1 1\n\uf0fa\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\uf0e9\n\uf0d7\uf02d\nFtF\nMM\n\uf061\uf070versus 5.0t was very good for both active additives and \nall simulants tested , resulting in  determination coefficient values ( R2) \nranging from 0.961 -0.995 for thymol and 0.983 -0.992 for carvacrol, \nsuggesting that the experimental release data are well described by the \nproposed diffusion model for short -range times.  \nThe analysis of the diffusion coefficients ( D) (Table 1. 8) shows that the \ndiffusion process for thymol and carvacrol in different simulants are \nindependent on theactive additives, w ith D values ranging from 1\u00d710\u221214 \nto 2\u00d710\u221214 m2 s-1. This behaviour was expected if considering that \ncarvacrol and thymol are isomers having similar molecular weights, \nchemical structure and polarity (Licciardello, Muratore, Mercea, Tosa and \nNerin, 2013) . The exception occurs for the diffusion of these compounds \ninto isooctane. In fact, D values for thymol and carvacrol are 4 and 6 \ntimes higher for this simulant than the average values for the other ones. \nThis is, however, in line with the previous discussion and with results \nreported in Section 3.2. as well. It is also worth noticing that  the \nmagnitude of D values found for these films are one order of magnitude \nlower than those obtained for similar AOs and films (Suppakul, \nSonneveld, Bigger and Miltz, 2011a) , suggesting that these f ilms can \nprovide a long -term release, or higher retention inside films, of AOs \nmaking them very useful for active packaging systems.  \nResults and Discussion.

Antibacterial  properties  \nFigure 1. 12 shows the results of the anti bacterial  tests for the active films  \nwith 8 wt% of additives against Staphylococcus  aureus  and Escherichia  coli by \nusing the agar disk diffusion method. This method is very simple and it is \nbased on the measurement of the clear zone caused by growth inhibition \nproduced by a film disk containing the antimicrobial agent when putting \nin direct contact with a bacterial culture (Singh, Singh, Bhunia and Singh, \n2003; Weerakkody, Caffin, Turner and Dykes, 2010) . In this sense, when \nthe PP -based  films with the active agents were placed on top of the \nculture media, it is expected that both additives will diffuse from the \npolymer matrix into the agar in a radial manner, producing a clear zone of \ngrowth inhibition around the active film.  \n \n \n \nFigure 1. 12.

This behaviour was also observed for the rest of materials with 8  \nwt% of additives  (carvacrol and the equimolar mixture of both \ncompounds) , but with smaller  inhibition zone ( Table 1. 9). These results \ndemonstrate the  antimicrobial action of both additives at high \nconcentrations (8 wt%). The study of the combined activity by carvacrol \nand thymol in the same film (PPTC8) showed that some additive effect \nbetween them took place considering the results obtained for sample s \nwith 4 wt% of each compound (PPC4 and PPT4) separately, where an \ninsufficient inhibition with no growth under the film was observed , as it \nwas already reported  by other authors  (Guarda, Rubilar,  Miltz and \nGalotto, 2011) . Finally, samples with additives at initial concentrations 6 \nwt% were also not enough to achieve an adequate inhibition  under  these \nconditions.  \n \nTable 1. 9.

There was just some effect only \nunder the film, but the inhibition zone was not observed. However, it is \nstill possible to attribute certain antibacterial properties of these films \nResults and Discussion . Chapter 1  \n~ 163 ~ \n against  Escherichia  coli, since this inhibition is categorized as \u201csufficient\u201d as \nit is described in the SNV 195920 -1992 Standard  (Pollini, Russo, Licciulli, \nSannino and Maffezzoli, 2009) . The low antibacterial activity against \nEscherichia  coli could be due to the higher resistance of Gram -negative \nmicroorganisms to polyphenols  making necessary either the use of higher \nconcentrations of carvacrol and thymol in these films or the use of these \nactive agents in the vapour phase , which has been reported to be more \nefficient against Escherichia  coli (Becerril, G\u00f3mez -Lus, Go\u00f1i, L\u00f3pez and \nNer\u00edn, 2007) . \nOther studies have described the antimicrobial effect of thymol and \ncarvacrol a gainst Escherichia coli (Xu, Zhou, Ji, Pei and Xu, 2008) , \nattributing this effect to their ability t o permeate and depolarize the \ncytoplasmic membrane. These authors observed areas with coagulated \nmaterial in the outer wall of cells caused by the precipitation of some \nproteins. However, other authors reported higher effectiveness of oregano \nessential oil  in Gram -positive bacteria  (L\u00f3pez, S\u00e1nchez, Batlle and Ner\u00edn, \n2005) . Therefore it can be  concluded that experimental conditions for \nsuch tests are important to get high or low resistance of specific \nmicroorganisms against these compounds  (L\u00f3pez, S\u00e1nchez, Batlle and \nNer\u00edn, 2007a; Weerakkody, Caffin, Turne r and Dykes, 2010) . \nAs a general conclusion, the addition of ca rvacrol and thymol to PP films \ndemonstrated some antimicrobial activity in bacterial strains potentially \npresent in food , in particular against Gram -positive bacteria.  \n \n \n \n \nResults and Discussion.

Observati on of fungal growth  \nThis study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the \ndeveloped films and their ability to act in active packaging formulations to \nincrease the shelf-life in fresh food . These tests were  based on the visual \nobservation of the inhibition of the fungal growth in food samples by the \naction of the highly volatile active additives, carvacrol and thymol. In this \nsense, some previous studies by other authors showed the effectiveness of \nthese compounds against different fungal s trains of particular interest in \nthe food industry (L\u00f3pez, S\u00e1nchez, Batlle and Ner\u00edn, 2007a) . \n \n \nFigure 1. 13.

Chapter 1  \n~ 165 ~ \n Figure 1. 13 shows the appearance of sliced strawberries and bread \nsamples at the beginning of the experiment (day 0) and after the \nobservation of microbial growth  for some days . Regarding strawberries, \nsatisfactory results were obtained for samples in con tact with the active \nfilms, since no fungal growth was observed until six days of storage. In the \ncase of strawberries in contact with the pure PP film (PP0), a rapid growth \nof microorganisms was observed  at the third day of treatment.  \nOn the other hand, t he presence of microorganisms was observed in \nbread samples in contact with the PP0 film after 13 days of storage, in \ncontrast to bread with the active films where no evidence of microbial \ncontamination after 45 days of storage was observed.  \n \nFigure 1. 14. Evaluation of the effectiveness of PP0 and active film containing 8 wt% of \nthymol (PPT8) to preserve uncut strawberries by observation of fungal growth.  \n \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 1  \n~ 166 ~ \n However, it was noticed that cut strawberries lost their organoleptic \nproperties after few days  of storage , even before the v isual evidence of \nfungal growth . For this reason , this study was also conducted for uncut \nstrawberries ( Figure 1. 14). For the PP0 film microbial growth was \nobserved after 6 days of storage. However, strawberries in contact with \nthe PPT8 film remained unaltered after 13 days. At this storage time \nstrawberries presented a physical deterioration due to  the storage \nconditions, but it is important to highlight that microbial growth was not \nobserved until the end of the study (15 days).  \nSimilar studies were performed with uncut strawberries by other authors, \ngetting satisfactory results for samples in cont act with films treated with \nEOs, such as cinnamon, oregano and thyme (Rodr\u00edguez, Batlle and Ner\u00edn, \n2007) . Regarding thyme and oregano EOs, their antimicrobial activity is \nattributed to the high amount of carvacrol and thymo l in their \ncomposition (Hazzit, Baaliouamer, Faleiro and Miguel, 2006) . Other \nstudies conducted in different fruits and vegetables also demonstrated the \neffectiveness of the constituents of different EOs (eugenol, thymol, \nmenthol or eucalyptol) to improve the organoleptic quality of food as well \nas to reduce the microbial growth, in particular when using a modified \natmosphere  for packaging  (Mastromatteo, Conte and Del Nobile, 2010) . \nIn conclusion, results obtained from food samples in contact with PP -\nbased  films containing carvacrol and thymol evidenced the effectiveness \nof these compounds to improve the shelf-life of perishable food, such as \nstrawberries and bread. Accordingly, these results also suggest the \npotential to use the se films in active packaging systems to replace the \ndirect addition of preservatives in food formulations.  \n \n \nResults and Discussion .

A \nhigh release of carvacrol was observed a fter 2 days  with slower release rate  \nafter 5, 10 and 15 days of storage. This mec hanism of controlled release \ncould lead to the improvement in shelf-life of the stored samples retarding \nthe post -harvest deterioration.

Chapter 1  \n~ 168 ~ \n Equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging (EMAP) is the most \ncommon packaging technology used to reduce the high respiration rate of \nstrawberries. It is known that a suitable atmosphere composition can \nreduce the respiration rate of fruits and fungal growth with minimal \nalteration of organoleptic properties (Rizzolo, Gerli, Prinzivalli, Buratti \nand Torreggiani, 2007) . In this sense, the identification of the main \ncompounds present in the headspace of the packaged strawberries was \ncarried out ( Table 1. 10) with PP0 films after 4 days  of storage at room and \nrefrigerated conditions . One of the most importan t processes occurring \nduring fruit ripening is the increase in volatiles contributing to fruit aroma \nand flavour , so the determination of volatiles is a very adequate tool to \npredict the decomposition degree of packaged fruits . In this case, t he \nmajor vola tiles identified for strawberries stored at room temperature \ninclude methyl -isopentanoate, 2 -methyl -butylacetate, methyl -hexanoate \nand hexyl -acetate. Methyl-butanoate and methyl -hexanoate were also \nfound in the headspace composition of refrigerated strawbe rries at 4 \u00b0C. \nThese results are in accordance with those obtained by other authors \nwhen studying volatile compounds in the same food samples (Rizzolo, \nGerli, Prinzivalli, Buratti and Torreggiani, 2007; Blanda  et al, 2009) . \nThe addition of thymol and carvacrol to PP films modified significantly \nthe atmosphere inside packages during the storage of food samples due to \ntheir release from film s. This fact could be related to the inhibition of the \nvolatile compounds identified under these conditions (Table 1. 10) that \nwere not detected in samples in contact with PPT8 and PPC8 films after 4 \ndays of storage.  \n \nResults and Discussion .

Ethanol results  from the fermentation and/or \nlipid oxidation in bread as it has been reported by other authors (Poinot  et \nal, 2007) . In this sense, commercial bread samples in contact with PP T8 or \nPPC8 films after 4 days of storage were characterized by significantly \nlower amounts of ethanol, suggesting a reduction on oxidation reactions \nby the presence of thymol and carvacrol. The improvement on the \noxidative stability of bread could be attri buted to the release of carvacrol \nand thymol resulting in the increas e of shelf-life. \nFrom these results it can be concluded that the release of both additives \nfrom active films to the headspace of the studied packaged foodstuff \nincreased with the storage time, as expected. The volatiles profile obtained \nby HS -SPME -GC/MS  was found to be different for samples in contact \nwith PP0 and those with PPT8 and PPC8, due to the modification of the \nfood headspace composition by the presence of these additives. \nTherefo re, the release of thymol and carvacrol from the active PP films \nhas shown to be effective in maintaining the quality of strawberries and \nbread submitted to different storage conditions. Finally, it can be \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 1  \n~ 170 ~ \n concluded that PP films with carvacrol and thymol could be a promising \nalternative to increase the foodstuff shelf-life. \n \n4. Conclusions  \nCarvacrol and thymol have shown their potential as active additives in PP -\nbased  films for food packaging with the double effect of their controlled \nrelease to foodstuff and  their possibility to protect food from oxidative \nand microbiological degradation processes.  \nCharacterization of the active PP-based films was carried out by using \ndifferent analytical techniques in order to evaluate the effect of carvacrol \nand thymol  in the polymer matrix and their stabilization performance \nduring processing. SEM micrographs showed certain porosity for films \nwith the highest additives concentrations  (8 wt%) . Some decrease in the \nelastic modulus was ob served  for the active formulations comp ared with \nneat PP. The presence of additives did not affect the thermal stability of \nPP, but resulted in decreasing  crystallinity and oxygen barrier properties. \nThe presence of thymol and carvacrol also increased the stabilization \nagainst thermo -oxidative degradation, with higher  oxidation induction \nparameters; suggesting that the polymer is well stabilized and a certain \namount of these compounds remained  in the polymer matrix after \nprocessing a t high temperatures.  \nThe release study of carvacrol and thymol from PP films into aqueous and \nfatty food simulants was also accomplished. Analytical methods for the \ndetermination of the target compounds in the studied food simulants were \nsuccessfully developed and validated. T he release of additives from films \nwas dependent on the food simulant and the amount incorporated  into \nthe polymer matrix . In particular, high migration levels  were obtained for \nResults and Discussion . Chapter 1  \n~ 171 ~ \n both additives into isooctane, showing higher migration  for thymol . The \nantiox idant activity of migration extracts was confirmed by the DPPH \nmethod, showing thymol a higher antioxidant capacity especially into \nisooctane with a 42.2 % of inhibition. The results obtained for the \nmigration kinetics study showed that carvacrol and thymo l incorporated \ninto PP films at 8 wt% were readily released into different food simulants, \nbut some quantities still remaining in the polymer matrix after 15 days. \nThe release kinetics of both additives from PP films showed a Fic kian \nbehaviour with diffusi on coefficients ranging from 1 -2\u00d710 \u221214 m2  s-1; \nexcept for the diffusion into isooctane where values 4-6 times higher were \nobtained.  \nFinally, thymol showed higher inhibition against bacterial strain s present \nin food than carvacrol, leading to higher antimic robial activity , in \nparticular against Gram -positive bacteria . The obtained results provided \nevidences that exposure to carvacrol and thymol is an effective way to \nenlarge the quality of strawberries and bread samples during distribution \nand sale.  \nAs a gen eral conclusion of this chapter , it could be stated  that the addition \nof AO/AM additives , such  as carvacrol and thymol to PP matrices in \nfood packaging applications shows high potential to improve quality and \nsafety aspects. In particular, the high efficie ncies of their release from PP \nactive films point s out  the great potential of these systems in AO/AM \npackaging of different food products to extend their shelf-life while  \navoid ing the direct addition of additives to food . \n \n \n \n \nResults and Discussion.

PLA was selected as the polymer matrix by its adequate \ncombination of mechanical and optical properties for the formulation of \ntransparent films while preserving the b iodegradable character of \nnanocomposites. Thymol was used as active additive while two different \nnano -reinforcements were selected, a commercial organo -modified \nmontmorillonite (MMT), Dellite\u00ae43B, in Section 2.1, and silver \nnanoparticles (Ag -NPs) in Sectio n 2.2. Both nanomaterials were selected \nby their commercial availability, good compatibility with the polymer \nmatrix and possibility of positive modifications in the mechanical, barrier \nand antimicrobial properties of PLA.  \n \nResults and Discussion . Chapter 2  \n~ 187 ~ \n 1. Introduction  \nResearch in biopolymers and their possible use in massive applications, \nsuch as food packaging, has gained a lot of attention in the last few years \nfrom technological and ecological points of view (Mellinas  et al, 2015) . In \nfact, the raising trend for the industrial use of environmentally -friendly \nmaterials, such as PLA, represents an interesting alternative to polymers \nderived from petroleum due to its renewable origin, biodegradability and \nbiocompatibility (Alix et al, 2013; Reddy, Vivekanandhan, Misra, Bhatia \nand Mohanty, 2013) . PLA is one of the most important commercially \navailable bio -based and biodegradable thermoplastic polyesters (Inkinen, \nHakka rainen, Albertsson and Sodergard, 2011)  by its adequate optical and \nmechanical properties, possibilities of modification with additives without \nhampering its biodegradation/biocompatibility abilities. In addition, PLA \nis classified as GRAS for food pack aging applications, fulfilling the \nrequirements to be in direct contact with aqueous, acidic and fatty foods \n(Peelman  et al, 2013) . \nPLA is a highly transparent and rigid material with a relatively low \ncrystallizatio n rate, making it a promising candidate for the fabrication of \nbiaxial oriented films, thermoformed containers and stretch -blown bottles \n(Inkinen, Hakkarainen, Albertsson and Sodergard, 2011) . However, some \nproperties of PLA are inadequ ate for food packaging applications, such as \npoor thermal stability and low glass transition temperature, gas barrier \nproperties, ductility and toughness  (Hwang  et al, 2012) . In the last few \nyears, some work has been reported to improve some of these PLA \nproperties. One of the most paved paths to overcome these drawbacks is \nby the reinforcement with nanomaterials, mostly layered silicates \n(Fukushima, Tabuani and Camino, 2009; Gamez -Perez  et al, 2011; \nLagaron and Lopez -Rubio, 2011; Pi card, Espuche and Fulchiron, 2011) . \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 2  \n~ 188 ~ \n In this sense, the incorporation of lamellar nanofillers  with high aspect \nratio, such as MMTs, has resulted in significant improvement in PLA \nmechanical, gas barrier, and optical properties  (Rhim, Hong and Ha, \n2009) . \nSilver nanoparticles (Ag -NPs) have also emerged as candidates for PLA \nmodification by their strong AM effect to  a wide range of \nmicroorganisms, joined to their stability at high temperatures and low \nvolatility (Echegoyen and Ner\u00edn, 2013) . Due to their unspecific \nmechanism of action, silver ions are active not only against a broad \nnumber of bacteria , but also against yeast, fungi and viruses (Sharma, \nYngard and Lin, 2009) . How ever, some concerns about the safety and \nenvironmental effects of products containing Ag -NPs in direct contact \nwith food have raised recently (Reidy, Haase, Luch, Dawson an d Lynch, \n2013; Addo Ntim, Thomas, Begley and Noonan, 2015) . According to the \nCouncil Directive 94/36/EC (1994), silver is accepted as food additive \nwith the code E174 if used as \u201cexternal coating of confectionary, \ndecoration of chocolates, liqueurs\u201d. Nevertheless, in food contact \nmaterials Ag -NPs are not yet allo wed, although the presence of certain \nsilver zeolites is already authorized in plastic food containers and rubber \nseals (Artiaga, Ramos, Ramos, C\u00e1mara and G\u00f3mez -G\u00f3mez, 2015) . Nano - \nand thin -film tech nologies based on novel systems associating metal \nnanoparticles to biopolymer matrices open a broad range of new \napplications, such as active biofilms for food packaging. The AM effect of \nAg-NPs loaded in selected polymer matrices against foodborne bacteri a \nhas been reported. For instance, Kanmani et al  developed active \nnanocomposite films by blending aqueous solutions of gelatin with \ndifferent concentrations of Ag -NPs (Kanmani and Rhim, 2014a) . \nNanocomposite films based on L DPE containing Ag -NPs were also \nResults and Discussion . Chapter 2  \n~ 189 ~ \n formulated, showing some improvement in the resistance to \nmicrobiological degradation of packed juice (Emamifar, Kadivar, Shahedi \nand Soleimanian -Zad, 2011) . Shameli et al evaluated the AM per formance \nof PLA/Ag -NPs nanocomposites against Escherichia coli  and Staphylococcus \naureus  by the disk diffusion method with high success (Shameli  et al, 2010) . \nFortunati et al reported that the antibacterial activity of Ag -NPs depends \non the bacterial strain and on differences in the cell wall structure between \nGram -negative an d Gram -positive bacteria (Fortunati, Rinaldi , et al , 2014) . \nRecently, food packaging companies are focusing on the improvement of \nquality and extending the food shelf -life while m aintaining their natural \nproperties. The increasing demand for natural additives has resulted in the \ndevelopment of new active materials based on polymer or biopolymer \nmatrices with natural additives, such as plant extracts or essential oils , \nwhich are cat egorized as GRAS by the FDA as well as the current \nEuropean Legislation (Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011. Plastic \nmaterials and articles intended to come into contact with food ) (Guarda, \nRubilar, Miltz and Galotto, 2011; Vald\u00e9s, Mellinas, Ramos, Garrig\u00f3s and \nJim\u00e9nez, 2014) . \nThe addition of natural additives with AM and/or AO properties into a \npolymer matrix allows their gradual release during storage and \ndistribution, extending food shelf-life by decreasing lipid auto -oxidation \nand the spo ilage by microorganisms, which are recognized as major causes \nof deterioration affecting both sensory and nutritional quality \n(Manzanarez -L\u00f3pez, Soto -Valdez, Auras and Peralta, 2011) . In this sense, \nthymol is one of the most promising natural additives to be used in active \nformulations since it  has been reported to be effective as AO an d AM (Al-\nBandak and Oreopoulou, 2007; Amorati, Foti and Valgimigli, 2013; \nGyawali and Ibrahim, 2014) . In fact, the presence of the hydroxyl \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 2  \n~ 190 ~ \n functional group in the thymol structure plays an important role in its AM \nand AO activity. The hydroxyl group promotes the delocalization of \nelectrons, acting as proton exchangers to reduce the gradient across the \ncytoplasmic membrane of bacterial cells and causing the collapse of the \nproton motive force and depletion of the ATP pool, leading to cell death \n(Gyawali and Ibrahim, 2014) . The AO properties  of thymol are due to the \nability to donate H -atoms from the phenol hydroxyl groups, which could \nreact with peroxyl radicals to produce stabilized phenoxyl radicals and \nterminating the lipid peroxidation chain reactions (Mastelic  et al, 2008; \nViuda -Martos, Navajas, Zapata, Fern\u00e1ndez -L\u00f3pez and P\u00e9rez -\u00c1lvarez, \n2010) . Several methods have been proposed to determine the high AO \nand AM activity of thymol as pure compound or extracted from plants \n(S\u00e1nchez -Moreno, 2002; Amorati and Valgimigli, 2015; Perricone, Arace, \nCorbo, Sinigaglia and Bevilacqua, 2015) . \nThe use of natural additives in combination with nanofillers to develop \nnovel active nanocomposites has been recently proposed (Kanmani and \nRhim, 2014a; Mihindukulasuriya and Lim, 2014; Q in et al, 2015; Shemesh  \net al, 2015; Tornuk, Hancer, Sagdic and Yetim, 2015) . In these active \nsystems, additives with AM and/or AO performance, such as thymol, are \nembedded into a matrix acting against bacteria and/or mo ulds extending \nfood shelf -life while improving quality (Sung et al, 2013) .

Losses of thymol \nduring processing are caused by evaporation or degradation due to high \ntemperatures. Nevertheless, these losses ( around 30 %) are in the same \nrange than those reported for other common antioxidants in PLA -based \nformulations, such as BHT (Ortiz -Vazquez, Shin, Soto -Valdez and Auras, \n2011) . These losses can be due to several factors, such as poor mixing in \nthe extruder, evaporation, thermal degradat ion and the own AO action of \nthese additives to protect the polymer during processing. But, it is \nremarkable that the volatility of active additives is desirable in food \npackaging applications to promote their migration from the polymer \nsurface to food (Wessling, Nielsen and Giacin, 2001) . Therefore, thymol \ncan be considered a good active additive in food packaging materials since \na large amount remains after processing and ma y be released from the \npolymer matrix to improve foodstuff shelf -life.

Films characterization  \n3.2.1.  Thermal analysis  \nFigure 2. 2 shows the weight loss and derivative thermogravimetric analysis  \n(DTG) curves obtained for neat PLA and all nanocomposite films. The \nmain degradation peak for PLA was observed in all samples around 365 -\n370 \u00b0C. A first degradation step around 120 \u00baC was observed in those \nmaterials containing thymol and it was attributed  to the evaporation \nand/or loss of thymol from the polymer matrix, as already discussed in \nChapter 1 and in agreement with Tawakkal et al. (Tawakkal, Cran and \nBigger, 2014) . These authors used TGA to study the retention of thymol \nin PLA -based films after processing and suggested that the evaporation \nand/or volatilization of thymol from the polym er matrix started at low \ntemperatures, remaining active for a broad temperature range. This result \nis another indication of the  presence of thymol after processing.  The \namount of thymol (w eight loss, wt%, 1st degradation step) was calculated  \nfrom the TGA curves and results are shown in Table 2. 3. The obtained \nresults were quite similar to those values obtained from the determination \nof thy mol by HPLC -UV already discussed in Section 3.1.  \nThe Tini, or onset temperature determined at 5 % of weight loss,  and Tmax \n(temperature for the maximum degradation rate) of PLA are also shown \nin Table 2. 3.

Weight loss (wt%) (a) and DTG (b) curves obtained for PLA -based films.  \n \nSome authors have considered several molecular mechanisms to explain \nthe PLA thermal degradation. The primary cause of this process is a non -\nradical, 'backbiting' which is refered to the formation of cyclic compounds \nthrough intramolecular reactions betwee n the carboxylic end group of the \nPLA chain and the ester bond of the chain. This reaction can produce \nlactide, oligomers of lactic acid, acetaldehyde, carbon monoxide and water, \ndepending upon the size of the cyclic transition state (Barrere  et al, 2014) { 050100\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700Weight Loss (wt%)\nTemperature (\u00baC)PLA\nPLA/D43B2.5\nPLA/D43B5\nPLA/T\nPLA/T/D43B2.5\nPLA/T/D43B5\n-0,06-0,04-0,020,000 100 200 300 400 500 600 700DTG (mg s -1)Temperature (\u00baC)\nPLA\nPLA/D43B2.5\nPLA/D43B5\nPLA/T\nPLA/T/D43B2.5\nPLA/T/D43B5(a) \n(b) \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 2  \n~ 210 ~ \n Other authors have pro posed radical reactions for the PLA degradation \nmechanism, which start with either alkyl -oxygen or acyl -oxygen homolysis \nleading to the formation of several types of oxygen - and carbon -centred \nmacro -radicals and carbon monoxide (Fukushima, Abbate, Tabuani, \nGennari and Camino, 2009) . \nDSC was used to determine the T g values in all PLA -based films ( Table \n2.3). It is known that this parameter is dependent upon the polymer \nstructural arrangement and corresponds to the torsion oscillation of the \ncarbon backbone giving a clear indication of the tough ness and ductility of \nthe polymer (Hughes, Thomas, Byun and Whiteside, 2012) . T g results of \nthese materials showed that the addition of D43B to PLA did not produce \nimportant variations in the polymer structure, as reported by other \nauthors for other PLA -based  nanocomposites (Lewitus, McCarthy, Ophir \nand Kenig, 2006; Scatto  et al, 2013) . However, the effect of thymol on the \nPLA macromolecular structure (and consequently on T g) was more \nimportant. In fact, the presence of thymol induced a decrease in more \nthan 10 \u00b0C in T g values, regardless of the presence of D43B ( Figure 2. 3),. \nA similar behaviour was reported by other authors in PLA formulations \nwith thymol (Tawakkal, Cran and Bigger, 2014 ) and other active additives \n(Byun, Kim & Whiteside, 2010; Hwang et al., 2012). This decrease in T g \nvalues could be explained by some plasticizing effect caused by the \naddition of thymol resulting in an increase in the molecular mobility of the \nmacromol ecular chains of the polymer matrix and the ductility of the final \nblend of PLA with thymol, with some reduction in the polymer toughness \nas will be discussed for the tensile properties of all materials. No other \nsignificant peaks were observed in the DSC curves ( Figure 2. 3), and it \ncould be concluded that the addition of thymol and D43B to the polymer \nmatrix did not change the inherent amorphous structure of PLA.  \n~ 211 ~ \n  \n \n(a) \n(b) \nFigure 2. 3.

Structural analysis  \nXRD is a very useful technique to determine d -spacing and gives an \naccurate estimation of the layer separation in silicate nanocomposites. The \nXRD pattern of neat PLA is characterized by a broad band approximately \nat 2\u03b8 = 15\u00b0, confirming its amorphous structure (Fukushima, Abbate, \nTabu ani, Gennari and Camino, 2009) . No significant differences were \nfound in the XRD patterns of all materials at this angle range, suggesting \nthat the polymer structure and crystallinity were not influenced by the \npresence of D43B and/or thymol  and corrobo rating the DSC results.  \nThe most significant differences in XRD  patterns of these materials were \ndetected in the low angle range (2 -10\u00b0) ( Figure 2. 4). D43B is characterized \nby a single diffraction peak at 2\u03b8 = 4.6 \u00b0 corresponding to the (001) plane \nof the silicate layers, accounting for a 19.2 \u00c5 interlayer distance. A shift of \nthe clay diffraction peak to lower angles would mean a higher distance \nbetween  layers and consequently suggests the good interaction of D43B \nwith the polymer matrix (Scatto  et al, 2013) . In fact, the results obtained \nfor XRD  patterns of PLA nanocomposites with D43B showed a \ndiffractio n peak around 2.6\u00ba, corresponding to an interlayer distance of \n35.6 \u00c5. In addition, a significant decrease in this peak intensity was \nobserved with the addition of the nanofiller, accounting for the formation \nof a more disordered structure. This result als o suggests the formation of \nan intercalated nanocomposite structure, as indicated by other authors \n(Picard, Espuche and Fulchiron, 2011) . The broad diffraction peak \nobserved at 2\u03b8 around 5.2 \u00b0 (d-spacing equal to 17.0 \u00c5) in the \nnanocomposite XRD patterns could be attributed to the fraction \ncharacterized by different alkylammonium chain arrangements in the \ninterlayer space corresponding to the (002) basal plane (Persico  et al, \n2009) . These observations were coincident to those by Araujo et al who \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 2  \n~ 213 ~ \n reported the XRD analysis of PLA macromolecules concluding that they \ncould diffuse and insert between the clay mineral layers (Ara\u00fajo, Botelho, \nOliveira and Machado, 2014) . \n \nFigure 2. 4. WAXS patterns of D43B, neat PLA and nanocomposite films.  \n \nThe lowest peak intensity for the nanocomposites studied by XRD was \nobtained  for PLA/T/D43B2.5. This result could be attributed to the \npresence of thymol favouring the nanoclay exfoliation making more \neffective the interaction between the silicate layers a nd the polymer \nmacromolecules, as already reported in other plasticized nanocomposites \nstudied in our research group (Martino, Ruseckaite, Jim\u00e9nez and Averous, \n2010) It could be concluded that thymol could promote the swelling of \nthe nanoclay stacks, as al so reported by other authors (Persico  et al, 2009) . \nHowever, the intensity of peaks for formulations with 5 wt% of D43B \nwere higher . This behaviour could be due to the unfavourable effect in the \npolymer -clay interactions by swelling at high loadings. In conclusion, \nXRD results suggest the effective intercalation of PLA macromolecules \ninto the D43B galleries achieved by mixing PLA with 2.5 wt% of D43B \nand 8 wt% of thymol.  020004000600080001000012000\n22,5 33,5 44,5 55,5 66,5 77,5 88,5 99,5 10Intensity (counts)\n2\u03b8 (\u00b0)D43B\nPLA\nPLA/T\nPLA/D43B2.5\nPLA/D43B5\nPLA/T/D43B2.5\nPLA/T/D43B5\nResults and Discussion.

Chapter 2  \n~ 215 ~ \n 3.2.4.  Mechanical properties  \nIt is known that Tg for amorphous PLA is in the range of 50 -60 \u00b0C. Below \nthat temperature, PLA shows high tensile strength and is quite brittle, \nresulting in difficulties for the manufacture of flexible films. However, the \naddition of plasticizers leads to the enhancement in the ductile properties \nof the polymer matrix by increasing the plastic elongation and reducing \nbrittleness (Byun, Kim and Whiteside, 2010) . Conversely, t he addition of \nnanoclays to polymer matrices results in improvement in toughness, \nparticularly in exfoliated nanocomposites.  \nIn this study, the results obtained for the tensile properties of all materials \nare shown in Table 2. 4. It was observed that elastic modulus (E, MPa) and \nelongation at break ( \u03b5B, %) of PLA suffered some modification by the \naction of thymol and D43B. In fact, t he add ition of thymol in binary PLA \nfilms resulted in a significant decrease (around  15 %) in the E value (p < \n0.05). This change in the polymer toughness could be explained, once \nagain, by some plasticizing effect caused by thymol to PLA matrices, \nalready discu ssed previously by the observed decrease in T g values. Similar \nresults  were reported in PLA and LDPE formulations  with active \ncompounds, such as resveratrol, carvacrol or \uf061-tocopherol (Persico  et al, \n2009; Hwang  et al, 2012; Tawakkal, Cran and Bigger, 2014) . \nAs expected, the addition of D43B to PLA in binary systems without \nthymol increased significantly the E values and decreased significantly \u03b5B \n(p < 0.05) . This effect was related to the reinforcement provided by \nsilicate layers to the PLA structure and the high aspect ratio, surface area \nand good dispersion of the nanoclay layers throughout the polymer matrix \nwith strong interactions (Quilaqueo Guti\u00e9rrez, Echeverr\u00eda, Ihl, Bifani and \nMauri, 2012; Scatto  et al, 2013) . \nResults and Discussion.

It  is possible to \nassert that thymol has an important influence on the mechanical \nperformance of these nanocomposites.

Chapter 2  \n~ 217 ~ \n nanofillers to polymer matrices can lead to significant enhancement in \ntheir barrier properties. However, the barrier to oxygen of PLA -based \nfilms with 2.5 and 5 wt% of D43B did not show significant differences \nbetween neat PLA and all the active nanocomposite films (p > 0.05) \n(Table 2. 4). These results can be attributed to the relatively low amount of \nD43B added to PLA being  insufficient to achieve an effective \nintercalation into the PLA matrix that could produce a tortuous pathway \nfor oxygen molecules to permeate through the film (Martino, Ruseckaite, \nJim\u00e9nez and Averous, 2010; Quilaqueo Guti\u00e9rrez, Echeverr\u00eda, Ihl, Bifani \nand Mauri, 2012; Reddy, Vivekanandhan, Misra, Bhatia and Mohanty, \n2013) . Regarding thymol, its addition did no t modify the properties of \nPLA-based films as other authors reported by attributing the decrease in \nthe oxygen permeability of PLA nanocomposites to the increase in the \nmobility produced by the addition of plasticizers (Jamshidian  et al, 2012) . \nA similar trend was obt ained for PLA -based ternary nanocomposites, \nwhere results showed that the oxygen barrier of neat PLA was not \nmodified with no significant improvement or decrease with the addition \nof thymol and the nanofiller (p > 0.05) as in conventional polymers used \nin food packaging like PS, PET or HDPE (Auras, Harte, Selke and \nHern\u00e1ndez, 2003) . \n \n3.2.6.

Similar colour differences \nwere reported when using other active additives, such as \nresveratrol, into PLA matrices, where the presence of these compounds \ncontributed to increase the films colour (Byun, Kim and Whiteside, 2010)\n \nFigure 2. 6.

Chapter 2  \n~ 219 ~ \n 3.3. Disintegrability under composting conditions  \nThe disintegrability of PLA under composting conditions has been \nstudied by some authors who mentioned that PLA suffers hydrolysis \nreactions induced by the diffusion of water into the polymer structure, \nproducing a reduction in the molecular weight by rand om non -enzymatic \nchain scissions of the ester groups and resulting in the formation of \noligomers and lactic acid (Luzi  et al, 2015) . Furthermore, these oligomers, \nwhen buried under composting conditions can be decomposed by \nmicroorganisms, including fungi and bacteria resulting in simple \nmolecules, mainly water, carbon dioxide and biomass monomers. In fact, \nonce started the water diffusion through the PLA matrix, the molecular \nweight decreases up to 10.000 -20.000 Da and microorganisms start \nmetabolizing these macromolecules into organic matter, and simple \nmolecules . \nIn this work, disintegrability under composting conditions of PLA and \nPLA-based active nanocomposites were studied.  Figure 2. 7 shows the \nvisual observation of films submitted to the disintegrability test and Table \n2.5 summari zes the values of weight loss obtained at different times. It \nwas observed that, after 2 days, the disintegration rate of PLA -based \nmaterials increased significantly (p < 0.05) for binary and ternary systems. \nIn fact, after 4 days samples changed their app earance ( Figure 2. 7) with a \ngeneral whitening effect, loss of transparency and evident deformation \nand size reduction. These results were indicative of  the beginning of the \nhydrolytic degradation process caused by simultaneous changes in the \nrefractive index due to water absorption, with formation of low molecular \nweight by -products and increase in the PLA crystallinity (Fukushima, \nTabuani, Arena, Gennari and Camino, 2013) . \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 2  \n~ 220 ~ \n However, the faster appearance of visual signs of  degradation observed in \nnanocomposites when compared to neat PLA could be due to the \npresence of hydroxyl groups from thymol and the organic modifier of \nD43B (Fukushima, Abbate, Tabuani, Gennari and Camino, 2009; \nFukushima, Tabuani, Arena, Gennari and Camino, 2013; Fortunati, Luzi , \net al, 2014). Hydroxyl groups can contribute to the heterogeneous \nhydrolysis of PLA by absorbing water from the medium resulting in a \nnotice able formation of labile bonds in the PLA structure with the \nconsequent significantly higher disintegrability rate (p < 0.05) (Sinha Ray, \nYamada, Okamoto and Ueda, 2003; Proikakis, Mamouzelos, Tarantili and \nAndreopoulos, 2006) . \n \n \nFigure 2. 7. Visual observations of PLA -based films at different times under composting \nconditions at 58 \u00b0C.  \n \nBinary and ternary systems suffered physical breakage ( Figure 2. 7) and the \nweight loss consider ably increased ( Table 2. 5) after 7 days, showing \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 2  \n~ 221 ~ \n significant differences in the disintegrability values regarding neat PLA (p \n< 0.05). Results at longe r testing times showed that the physical \ndegradation progressed with burial time, resulting in the complete \ndisintegration of the initial sample after 35 days where the degree of \ndisintegration exceeded 90 % covering the ISO 20200 requirements.  \nFTIR  analys is of neat PLA and PLA -based nanocomposite films obtained \nduring the disintegrability tests provided the PLA characteristic bands: \n1750 cm\u22121 (C=O), 1440 cm\u22121 (CH(CH 3)), and 1267 cm\u22121 (C-O-C) as well \nas three peaks at 1123, 1082 and 1055 cm\u22121 related to the C -C-O groups. \nFigure 2. 8 shows the FTIR spectra of neat PLA, PLA/T and \nPLA/T/D43B5 after 0, 7 and 21 days of the study. A general reduct ion in \nthe intensity of the three peaks related to the C -C-O groups was detected \nafter 7 days, resulting in their disappearance at 21 days in composting \nconditions for all the studied formulations. Similar results were reported \nby Fortunati et al, who prop osed that the decrease in intensity of the peaks \ncorresponding to C -C-O groups was related to the scission of the PLA \ninterchain bonds caused by the hydrolysis during the disintegration tests \n(Fortunati, Luzi , et al , 2014) . \nSome decrease in the intensity for the band corresponding to the C-O-C \nstretching vibration at 1267 cm\u22121 was also observed  in all samples. Both \nmodifications can be due to the depletion of the lactic acid and oligomer \nmolecules caused by microorganisms, le aving highly reactive carboxylate \nions end groups  (Khabbaz, Karlsson and Albertsson, 2000) .

Chapter 2  \n~ 224 ~ \n Figure 2. 9 shows the DSC thermograms obtained from the first heating scan \nfor all PLA -based films at different composting times. The endothermic peak \nobserved immediately after T g at day 0 corresponds to the enthalpic relaxation \nprocess for all the tested materials. This effect was related to the ageing \nprocess of PLA and it was previously observed by other authors (Hughes, \nThomas, Byun and Whiteside, 2012; Burgos, Martino and Jim\u00e9nez, 2013) . \nHowever, the initially amorphous PLA -based materials developed multiple \nendothermic peaks just after  7 days of testing. In fact, the enthalpic relaxation \npeak gradually disappeared due to the hydrolytic reactions at the beginning of \nthe disintegration process. Yang et al related this behaviour with the moisture \nabsorption under composting conditions, since water could serve as a \nplasticizer agent in PLA matrices (Yang, Fortunati, Dominici, Kenny and \nPuglia, 2015) . \nThe gradual disintegration suffered when increasing the testing time allows \nthe observation of new melting peaks r elated to the formation of crystalline \nstructures with different perfection degrees in the PLA matrix ( Figure 2. 9). \nThese results are correlated with v isual changes, since hydrolysis promotes \ncrystallization in the polymer matrix, resulting in important changes in the \ndisintegrability behaviour. Similar results were reported by other authors, who \nsuggested that the appearance of multiple melting peaks co uld be related to \nthe formation of different crystal structures due to the polymer chains \nscission produced during degradation (Fukushima, Abbate, Tabuani, Gennari \nand Camino, 2009; Fortunati, Armentano , Iannoni , et al , 2012; Gorrasi and \nPantani, 2013; Yang, Fortunati, Dominici, Kenny and Puglia, 2015) . \nFigure 2. 10 shows the DSC t hermograms recorded during the second heating \nscan for samples submitted to the disintegration test.

Release st udy \nActive nanocomposites used in food packaging should release the desired \nchemicals at suitable rates to result in a noticeable enhancement of foods \nshelf-life and quality during storage. The incorporation of active additives, \nsuch as thymol, to polymer matrices should permit their gradual release to \nfood, minimizing surface contamination, but obviously satisfying the \nrequirements stated in the current food packaging legislation.  \nThe use of nanofillers in active packaging systems has revealed some \nability  in retarding the release of active additives from polymer matrices, \nimproving the action of the additives and extending foodstuff shelf -life \n(Campos -Requena, Rivas, P\u00e9rez, Garrido -Miranda and Pereira, 2015) . In \nthis work, migration tests were carried out to evaluate the effect of the \nnanoclay in controlling the release kinetics of thymol from the PLA matrix \nto ethanol 10 % (v/v) ( Figure 2. 11). It was observed that the addition of \nD43B resul ted in the delay in the thymol release due to the larger \ntortuosity effect imposed by the dispersed nanoclay, as reported by \nSanchez -Garcia et al (Sanchez -Garcia, Ocio, Gimenez and Lagaron, 2008) . \nThe formulation with the highest amount of D43B (PLA/T/D43B5) \nshowed lower migration rates, retaining higher amounts of thymol in the \npolymer structure.  \nThe final amounts of thymol migrated in ethanol 10 % (v/v) at  40 \u00baC after \n10 days were 285.0 \u00b1 3.3, 275.5 \u00b1 13.8 and 235.3 \u00b1 19.4 mg thymol kg-1Food \nsimulant  for PLA/T, PLA/T/D43B2.5 and PLA/T/D43B5, respectively.  \n \nResults and Discussion.

The analysis of the partition coefficients (\u03b1 and KP,F) showed that the \nassessment of diffusion of thymol is clearly influenced by them in the \ndifferent  tested times.  \n \nThus, assuming that the thymol migration is governed by the Fick\u2019s 2nd \nlaw Equation (2.7)  \n \n                                                                                   (2.7) \nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient, c is the concentration of the released \nspecies and x is the space coordinate.  \nFor a plane sheet of thickness l, and the initial condition l/2 < x < l/2, \nconsidering constant the concentration of thymol released and with a \nboundary condition of a partition c oefficient between both phases, the \nanalytical solution of Equation (2.7) for one -dimensional diffusion of \nthymol in a limited volume solution  is expressed as Equation (2.8) (Crank, \n1975) : \n \n                                                           (2.8) \nwhere qn are the non -zero positive roots of tanq n = -\u03b1 qn and l is the \npolymeric matrix half -thickness.  \nTaking into account these conditions, the diffusion coefficients ( D, cm2 s-\n1) were obtained from a least -square fit of Equation (2.8) to experimental \ndata (solid lines in Figure 2. 12). \nThe D values ( Table 2.6), calculated for each sample, were determined by \nminimizing the root mean square errors (RMSE) of the measured and \u07f2\u073f\n\u07f2\u0750=\u07f2\n\u07f2\u0754\u0d6c\u0726\u07f2\u073f\n\u07f2\u0754\u0d70 \n \uf028\uf0292\n,\n2 2 2\n1 ,2 11 exp1F t n\nn F nM Dq t\nM q l\uf061 \uf061\n\uf061 \uf061\uf0a5\n\uf03d \uf0a5\uf02b\uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf02d\uf03d \uf02d \uf0ea \uf0fa\uf02b \uf02b \uf0eb \uf0fb\uf0e5\nResults and Discussion.

Chapter 2  \n~ 234 ~ \n In fact, a deeper analysis of the fitting between experimental and \ncalculated values showed that positive deviations of the fitting line for \nshort times (i.e., MF,t/M F,\u221e,<0.60) and negative deviations for \nMF,t/M F,\u221e>0.60 were observed in all cases. These results allow estimating \nthe kinetics of thymol migration for short times. For such purpose, a \nsimplified migration model derived from Equation (2.8) and useful for \nlinear regression analysis was used (Equation (2.10) ) (Chung, Papadakis \nand Yam, 2002) . \n \n                                                               (2.10) \n \nDiffusion coefficients for short times, (D\u2019, cm2 s-1), were computed by \nusing the linear fitting of Equation (10) to the experimental data ( Figure \n2.13). Results obtained showed a very good fit between computed and \nexperimental  values as a function of , with \ndetermination coefficients ( R2) higher than 0.999, suggesting  that the \nexperiment al release data are well described by the proposed diffusion \nmodel for short -range times.   \nEven though the whole data range was not characterised by a Fickian \ndiffusion process (probably due to the fitting controlled by the last points \nin the plot), the fi tting to the first data (called short -range time) is poor. \nIndeed, with Equation (2.10), results lead to best fitting values. Therefore, \nthe discrepancy in D values obtained ( D and D') from Equation (2.8) and \nEquation (2.10) is enough to conclude that a no n-Fickian migration model \nis observed in this system.  \n   0.5'0.5\n, 0. 5\n0.5\n,01 1 1F t\nPM DtM l\uf070 \uf061 \uf061 \uf070\uf0e9 \uf0f9\n\uf02d \uf0d7 \uf03d\uf02d \uf0d7 \uf02b\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0d7\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0eb \uf0fb\n 5.0\n0,, 11\n\uf0fa\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\uf0e9\n\uf0d7\uf02d\nFtF\nMM\n\uf061\uf070  5.0t\nResults and Discussion.

Plots of  versus  for the migration of thymol from: \nPLA/T ( ), PLA/T/D43B2.5 ( ), and PLA/T/D43B5 ( ), into ethanol 10 % (v/v).  \n \nIn fact, the inability of the model to predict the release kinetics in ethanol \n10 % (v/v) according to a Fickian diffusion process could be due to the \nstructural modifications of the PLA matrix caused by sorption of ethanol, \nwhich could act as a PLA plasti cizer and could favour the opening of the \nstructure creating void spaces and favouring the thymol release at long \ntimes (Mascheroni, Guillard, Nalin, Mora and Piergiovanni, 2010) . \nLikewise, as the diffusion rate increased ( D > D'), the intermolecular \ninteraction between ethanol and PLA chains was enhanced at long times \n(Samsudin, Soto -Valdez and Au ras, 2014) . \nAt the best of our knowledge, there are no reported values of the \ndiffusion coefficient of thymol in PLA nanocomposite films. However, in \nthe release study presented in Chapter  1 the value of the diffusion \ncoefficient for thymol in PP -based films in ethanol 10 % (v/v) was higher \n(1.75 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm2 s\u22121 ) than those reported in Table 1.5.

Chapter 2  \n~ 236 ~ \n reported the values of the diffusion coefficient of thymol in LLDPE films \nin ethanol 10 % (v/v), ranging from 7.5 \u00d7 10\u22128 to 1.8 \u00d710\u22128 cm2 s\u22121, \nwhich were higher than those obtained in this work. This differences \ncould be explained by the lower density of LLDPE resulting in higher \nmass transport properties (Torres, Romero, Macan, Guarda and Galotto, \n2014) . \nWhen considering the thymol release profiles shown in Figure 2. 11, the D \nvalues are consistent with these results. The presence of the nanoclay \nleads to the decrease in the thymol release at long -time. Beltran et al \nreported the same behaviour when studied PCL with hydroxytyrosol and \nC30B. These authors related the decrease in the hydroxytyrosol release \nrate with the interactions between this compound and C30B (Beltr\u00e1n, \nValente, Jim\u00e9nez and Garrig\u00f3s, 2014) . \nIn conclusion, th ese results suggest that it is possible to control the release \nof active additives with interest in the design of novel active \nnanocomposites through the incorporation of laminar nanoclays, since the \nincrease observed in the interlayer distance and interca lation results in the \ndecrease in the diffusion of thymol through the polymer matrix by the \ntortuous path imposed with the incorporation of nanoclays to PLA -based \nfilms (Campos -Requena, Rivas, P\u00e9rez, Garrido -Miranda and Pereira, \n2015) . \n \n3.5.

As expected, all extracts containing thymol  \nshowed important AO activity.  \nIt was observed that the amount of thymol after 10 days of contact with \nthe food simulant ( MF,10 days) was lower than the amount retained into the \npolymeric matrix ( MP,0). But the released amount of thymol was  enough to \npermit considering this additive as an efficient AO in PLA -based \nnanocomposites, since the inhibition values were around 77 % after 10 \ndays, quite close to IP,0. These results were in agreement with those \nobtained in PP -based films ( Chapter  1) where thymol and carvacrol were \nused as active additives.  \n \nTable 2. 7.

Chapter 2  \n~ 239 ~ \n (PLA/D43B2.5 and PLA/D43B5). It has been stated that the antibacterial \nactivity of phenolic monoterpenes, including thymol, is related with their \nability to react with phospholipids present in the cell membranes, causing \nsome increase in the cell wall p ermeability and the consequent leakage of \ncytoplasm as well as their interaction with some enzymes located on the \ncell wall (Burt, 2004; Emiroglu, Yemis , Coskun and Candogan, 2010) . \nIndeed, and as discussed in a previous chapter , thymol has the ability to be \nreleased from polymer matrices and then it can disrupt the lipid structure \nof the bacteria cell wall, leading t o the destruction of cell membranes, \ncytoplasmic leakage and ultimately microorganisms death (Kavoosi, \nDadfar and Purfard, 2013) . \nFormulations with D43B also showed some antibacterial activity against \nEscherichia coli  and Staphylococcus aureus  strains, but some special features \nshould be highlighted. De Azeredo et al reported that OMMT could \nproduce the rupture of cell membranes resulting in inactivation o f both, \nGram -positive and Gram -negative bacteria, due to the presence of \nquaternary ammonium groups able to react with lipids and proteins in the \nmicroorganism cell wall (de Azeredo, 2013) . Nevertheless , taking into \naccount the migration results previously discussed, the very low migration \nrate for D43B and the controlled release of thymol from the active \nnanocomposite films, it could be assumed that the antibacterial action of \nthese nanocomp osites is controlled by two factors, as already stated by \nother authors (Nigmatu llin, Gao and Konovalova, 2008) , i.e. the solid \nsurface of D43B and the controlled release of thymol already reported in \nthese PLA -based active nanocomposites. Indeed, the highest percentages \nof viability in this study were obtained for the active terna ry \nnanocomposites with thymol and D43B.  \nResults and Discussion.

The addition \nof thymol did not significantly affect the thermal stability of PLA, but \nsome decrease in the elastic modulus was observed due to the slight \nplasticizing effect induced by the active additive. The incorporation of \nD43B and thymol did not r esult in a clear enhancement of oxygen barrier \nproperties, but tensile behaviour was improved due to the intercalation \nand partial exfoliation of nanoparticles through the polymer  matrix, as \nobserved by XRD and TEM . Some differences in films colour were \nobserved by the addition of thymol and D43B, being larger for films with \nthe highest concentration of the nanoclay. Nevertheless, the intrinsic \ntransparency of PLA was not affected by the addition of both \ncomponents.  \nIt was observed that most of the thymol i nitially added to the PLA \nmatrices (around 70 -75 %) remained in the nanocomposites after \nprocessing, ensuring their posterior applicability to active systems.  \nResults of the disintegrability tests under composting conditions showed \nthat the incorporation o f 8 wt% of thymol to PLA -based formulations \ncould favour the disintegration of the polymer matrix, due to the presence \nof the reactive hydroxyl group in the thymol structure, while the presence \nof D43B did not show any influence in the disintegration perfo rmance. \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 2  \n~ 242 ~ \n The combination of both additives induced higher degradation rates, \nsuggesting their advantages in industrial applications where biodegradation \ncould be an issue, such as food packaging.  \nThe applicability of these active nanocomposite films in food  packaging \nwas evaluated by studying the release of thymol into an aqueous simulant \nand their antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. The amount of thymol \nreleased into the aqueous food simulant was measured by HPLC -UV and \na kinetic model was proposed, sug gesting that the release of thymol is \ninfluenced by the presence of D43B and the PLA matrix. This continuous \nrelease favoured the antioxidant activity of these films determined by \nusing the spectrophotometric DPPH method, resulting in a high \npercentage of inhibition. Finally, the addition of D43B has some effect in \nthe improvement of the antibacterial activity of thymol -based films, \nshowing higher inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus  and Escherichia coli . \nIn summary, the combination of thymol and D43B i ntroduced into a \ncommercial PLA matrix, in particular the combination of 8 wt% of \nthymol and 2.5 wt% of D43B, showed high potential to develop new bio -\nbased active films with application in fresh food packaging. The \nimprovement in the functional properties  of PLA -based films due to the \naddition of the active additive and the nanoclay also increased their \nantimicrobial and antioxidant properties, demonstrating the activity and \nhigh potential for packaging applications.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 Section 2.2.  \nActive nanocomposites based on PLA with thymol \nand silver nanoparticles for food packaging \napplications  \n \nResults and Discussion . Chapter 2  \n~ 245 ~ \n Summary  \nThe present work aims to develop biodegradable active nanocomposites \nwith AM and AO properties based  on PLA with thymol and Ag -NPs as \nactive additives. In order to achieve this objective, firstly, injection \nmoulded dog -bone bars were obtained and characterized to evaluate the \nthermal, morphological and mechanical properties as a preliminary \napproach to o btain active packaging systems for the food industry. \nSecondly, thin nanocomposite films (around 40 \u03bcm thick) were developed \nand characterized in order to evaluate their thermal, optical and barrier \nproperties . The influence of thymol and Ag -NPs on the deg radation of \nPLA-based active nanocomposites (films and dog -bone bars) in \ncomposting conditions was also studied. M igration tests were carried out \nto study the kinetic release of the nanocomposite films performance in \nfood contact. Finally, the AO performan ce and AM activity of the \ndeveloped films were evaluated by using the DPPH free radical \nscavenging  method  and against two typical foodborne bacteria  (Escherichia \ncoli and Staphylococcus aureus) , respectively . These points are of great interest \nin order to prove the potential applicability of the developed systems as \nfood active packaging solutions through controlled release formulations. \nThe scheme in the next page shows the graphical flow of tests performed \nwhose results will be discussed in this section.  \n \nResults and Discussion.

An additional sample without any additive was also \nprepared as control , as summarized in Table 2. 8. \nA total mixing time of 6 min were used in binary systems . Thymol was \nadded in the last 3 minutes of the extrusion process and the screw speed \nwas then reduced to 100 rpm to limit losses by v aporization and thymol \nResults and Discussion.

Active nanocomposites characterization  \nPLA-based active nanocomposites were characterized by the \ndetermination of their thermal, mechanical, morphological, optical (colour \nand opacity) and barrier (oxygen transmission, and water vapour \npermeability) properties.  \n \n5.3.1.  Thermal properties  \nTGA tests were performed by using a TGA Seiko Exstar 6300 (USA). \nSamples (around 7 mg) were heated from 25 to 700 \u00b0C at 10 \u00b0C min-1 \nheating rate under nitrogen atmosphere (flow rate 50 mL min-1). Analyses \nwere performed in triplicate.  \nDSC tests were conducted, in triplicate, by using a DSC Mettler Toledo \n822/e (Schwerzenbach, Switzerland) under nitrogen atmosphere (50 mL \nmin-1).

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)  \nThe surface of neat PLA and PLA active nanocomposites and the cross \nsection of PLA/Ag/T6 and PLA/Ag /T8 ternary composites in dog -bone \nbars were analysed by FESEM (Supra 25 -Zeiss, Jena, Germany) to study \ntheir homogeneity and influence of thymol and Ag -NPs on the PLA \nmorphology. Samples were coated with a gold layer prior to analysis in \norder to increase  their electrical conductivity.  \n \n \n \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 2  \n~ 250 ~ \n 5.3.3.  Mechanical properties of injection moulded samples  \nTensile tests were used to evaluate the mechanical behaviour of neat PLA \nand the new active nanocomposites by using a digital Lloyd instrument \nLR 30K with a cross -head sp eed of 1 mm min-1 and a load cell of 30 kN. \nDog-bone bars (2 mm thick) were prepared for testing by following the \nUNE ISO 527 Standard. Important parameters related with this study (\u03b5 b, \nTS and E) were calculated from the resulting stress -strain curves \naccording to the ASTM D882 -09 Standard procedure (ASTM, 2009) . \nTests were carried out at room temperature and all values reported were \nthe average of five measurements.  \n \n5.3.4.  Optical properties of films  \nThe light transmission of PLA -based films was determined, in triplicate, \nby using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 UV -Vis spectrophotometer \n(Waltham, MA, USA). The measurements were carried out at 500 nm in \nthe transmittance (%) mode to evaluate the transparency of the developed \nfilms i n the visible region. Each film was cut in 2.5 x 2.5 cm2 strips.  \nModifications on colour caused by the addition of additives into the PLA \nmatrix were determined with a Konica CM -3600d COLORFLEX -DIFF2 \ncolorimeter (Reston, VA, USA) using the CIELab colour pa rameters: L* \n(lightness), a* (red-green coordinate) and b* (yellow -blue coordinate). \nMeasurements were taken at five different locations around the film \nsurface and average values were calculated.

Chapter 2  \n~ 251 ~ \n 5.3.5.  Barrier properties of films  \nAn oxygen permeation analyser (8500 model Systech, Metrotec S.A, \nSpain) was used for OTR tests with pure oxygen (99.9 %). Film samples \nwere cut into 14 cm diameter circles and they were clamped in the \ndiffusion chamber at 25 \u00b0C before testing. Tests were p erformed in \ntriplicate and average values were expressed as oxygen transmission rate \nper film thickness (OTR\u00b7e).  \nWVP was determined gravimetrically in accordance with the test method \nindicated in the ASTM E 96M -05 Standard for water vapour transmission \nof materials.

The cells were placed in a climatic chamber \n(Dycometal, Barcelona, Spain) at 23.0 \u00b0C and 50%  RH. The amount of \nwater vapour transferred through films and absorbed by the desiccant was \ndetermined as the weight gain of the cell  after 24 h. A minimum of seven \ndeterminations were taken to plot weight variation vs time resulting in a \nlinear characteri stic graph. Water vapour transmission (WVT) was \ncalculated using Equation 2.12.  \n \n                                                              (2.12) \nwhere A is the film area exposed (0.005 m2) and G/t is the slope obtained \nfrom the weight gained in the permeation cell (G, grams) versus time (t, \nhours).  \nThe water vapour permeability (WVP) of film samples was determined, in \ntriplicate, using Equation 2.13.  \n \u0739\u0736\u0738= \u0d6b\u0729\u0750\u0d57\u0d6f\n\u0723\u0d58  (\u0743 \u2219\u210e\u22121\u2219\u0749\u22122) \nResults and Discussion.

Quantification of thymol in PLA -based films after processing  \nThe actual amount of thymol present in PLA -based films after processing \nwas determined by solid -liquid extraction followed by HPLC -UV analysis. \n0.05 \u00b1 0.01 g of each film were extracted with 10 mL of methanol at 40.0 \n\u00b0C and 50 % RH for 24 h in a climate ch amber (Dycometal CM -081, \nBarcelona, Spain). Three replicates were carried out for each formulation. \nA Shimadzu LC -20A liquid chromatograph (Kyoto, Japan) with UV \ndetector and a LiChrospher 100 RP18 column (250 mm \u00d7 5 mm \u00d7 5 \u03bcm, \nAgilent Technologies, USA) w ere used . An isocratic elution of 40:60 (v:v) \nacetonitrile:water at 25 \u00b0C and a flow rate 1 mL min-1 were applied. 20 \u03bcL \nof the extracted samples were injected and analyses were performed in \ntriplicate at 274 nm.  Standard solutions of thymol in methanol at  \nconcentrations between 100 and 500 mg kg-1 were used to elaborate the \ncalibration curve for the thymol quantification.  \n \n5.5. Identification of thymol and Ag -NPs in PLA -based films  \nFTIR analysis was performed by using a Jasco FTIR 615 spectrometer \n(Easton, MD, USA) equipped with a DTGS detector to confirm the \npresence of thymol into the PLA -based films.

A Perkin Elmer Instruments (Lambda 35) UV -Vis \nspectrophotometer (Waltham, MA, USA) operating in the 2 50-500 nm \nrange was used.  \nXRD patterns were recorded at room temperature in the scattering angle \n(2\u03b8) from 2.5 to 80\u00b0 (step size = 0.05 \u00ba min-1) by using filtered Cu K\u03b1 \nradiation (\u03bb = 1.54 \u00c5). A Bruker D8 -Advance diffractometer (Madison, \nWI, USA) was used, with voltage and current of X -ray tubes of 40 kV and \n40 mA, respectively.  \n \n5.6. Disintegrability under composting conditions  \nDisintegration tests under composting conditions were performed in dog -\nbone bars and films by following the ISO -20200 standard method (UNE -\nEN_20200, 2006) . A commercial compost with certain amount of \nsawdust, rabbit food, starch, sugar, oil and urea was used. Testing samples \n(15 x 5 x 2 mm3 for injection moulded samples  and 20 x 20 mm2 for \nfilms) were buried at 5 cm depth in perforated boxes and incubated at 58 \n\u00b0C. The aerobic conditions were guaranteed by mixing the compost softly \nand by the periodical addition of water according to the standard \nrequirements.  \nDifferent disintegration t imes were selected to recover samples from their \nburial and further tested: 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 57 days for injection \nmoulded samples;  and 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 days for films.

The disintegrability value for each material at \ndifferent times was obtained by normalizing the sample weight with the \nvalue obtained at the initial time.

Morphological changes in the  surface of the recovered samples \nafter testing at 0 and 14 days were studied by FESEM. FTIR spectra \n(Jasco FT -IR 615, USA) were also recorded in the 400 -4000 cm-1 range, in \nATR mode.  \n \n5.7. Release tests from PLA -based films  \nThe release of thymol and Ag -NPs fro m PLA -based nanocomposite films \nwas studied in ethanol 10 % (v/v) as food simulant, in agreement with the \nEuropean Standard EN 13130 -2005 (UNE -EN_131 30-1, 2005)  and the \nCommission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 on plastic materials and articles \nintended to come into contact with food \n(Commission_Regulation/(EU)/No -10/2011) .

Silver release study  \nThe release of Ag -NPs from nanocomposite films into ethanol 10 % (v/v) \nat different times was  directly determined by using an Agilent 7700x \nICP/MS (Santa Clara, CA, USA) under conditions reported by Song et al \nwith some modifications in the experimental parameters (Song, Li, Lin, \nWu and Chen, 2011) . A Scott -type spray chamber (Agilent Technologies) \nwas used for sample introduction connected to a MicroMist small volume \nnebulizer. Sampling depth was 8.0 mm and argon was used as the carrier \ngas.

Rhodium was \nused as internal standard and it was introduced by  using a peristaltic pump \nin line with the sample solution. Suspensions were sonicated for 1 minute \nprior to analysis.  \nCalibration standard working solutions were obtained by dilution of a \nstock solution (0.1 mg kg-1) of Ag -NPs in ethanol 10 % (v/v) to avo id \nmatrix effects. Dilutions were prepared by accurately weighing the \ncorresponding aliquot of the stock solution after 1 minute sonication (\u00b1 \n0.1 mg). LOD and LOQ values were calculated from the regression \nparameters obtained from the calibration curve (3  Sy/x/a and 10 S y/x/a, \nrespectively; where S y/x is the standard deviation of the residues and a is \nthe slope), resulting in 1.19 \u00b5g kg-1 and 3.98 \u00b5g kg-1, respectively.

Determination of the antioxidant activity  \nThe AO activity of thymol released into ethanol 10 % (v/v) was analysed \nin terms of radical scavenging ability by using the DPPH method, as \nproposed by Byun et al with slight modifications (Byun, Kim and \nWhiteside, 2010 ). An aliquot of 100 \u03bcL of each extract was mixed with 3.9 \nmL of a methanolic solution of DPPH (23 mg L-1) in a capped cuvette. \nThe mixture was shaken vigorously and it was kept in the dark at room \ntemperature for 200 min. The absorbance of each solution was \ndetermined at 517 nm by using a Biomate -3 UV -Vis spectrophotometer \n(Thermo Scientific, USA).

Chapter 2  \n~ 261 ~ \n DSC thermograms for all the tested materials are shown in  Figure 2. 18. \nSince the PLA used in this study was mostly amorphous, a T g value could \nbe determined in all samples ( Table 2. 9). It is known that T g is dependent \nupon the polymer structural arrangement and corresponds to the torsion \noscillation of the carbon backbone (Hughes, Thomas, Byun and \nWhiteside, 2012) . So, it wa s expected that the addition of thymol could \nlead to some reduction in T g, as observed in Table 2. 9. In fact, binary and \nternary systems with thymol sh owed a significant decrease in more than \n10 \u00b0C on T g values (p < 0.05). This reduction was associated with the \nalready reported plasticizing effect of thymol in polymer matrices, also \nobserved when thymol was added to a PP matrix (Chapter 1), increasing \nthe molecular mobility of the polymer structure. A similar behaviour was \nreported by other authors for the addition of similar AOs to PLA with a \nremarkable reduction on T g values (Byun, Kim and Whiteside, 2010; \nHwang  et al, 2012; Arrieta, L\u00f3pez, Ferr\u00e1ndiz and Peltzer, 2013) . DSC \nresults also showed that the addition of Ag -NPs had no relevant effect on \nthe T g values of PLA, in agreemen t with previous studies (Fortunati, \nArmentano, Zhou, Iannoni , et al , 2012) . Conversely, parameters related to \ncrystallization or melting of PLA nanocomposites were not observed due \nto the mentioned amorphous structure of the polymer used in this study, \nwhich remained after the addition of thymol and Ag -NPs to the polymer \nmatrix.  \n \nResults and Discussion.

FESEM \nmicrographs were also tak en to cross section of ternary systems to \nevaluate the incorporation of both additives to the polymer matrix ( Figure \n2.20). It was noticed that Ag -NPs were well dispersed with no apparent \nagglomerates, which could be probably r elated to the presence of thymol \nin these formulations (Fortunati, Armentano, Zhou, Puglia , et al , 2012) . \n \n~ 263 ~ \n Figure 2. 19.

Chapter 2  \n~ 264 ~ \n authors (Kanmani and Rhim, 2014a) . Some reduction in tensile strength \nvalues was observed for the PLA -thymol binary systems, being more \nevident for those with the highest content (8 wt%, p < 0.05). This effect \ncould be due to the increase in polymer chains mobility caused by the \npresence of thymol in these formulations (Fabra, Talens and Chiralt, \n2008) . These results are also related with those obtained for mechanical \nproperties of PP -based films in Chapter 1 and active PLA -based films \nwith D43B.  \nThe combined action of thymol and Ag -NPs on the PLA mechanical \nbehaviour was also evaluated. A s ignificant  decrease in  elastic modulus of \nthe ternary formulations was observed compared to neat PLA resulting in \nmore flexible and stretchable materials  (p < 0.05) . It could be suggested \nthat the presence of Ag -NPs contributed to the thymol ability to increase \nthe PLA chain mobility, which also promoted a more effective dispersion \nof silver nanoparticles. These combined effects could be related to the \npresence of Van der Waals interactions between the hydroxyl g roups of \nthymol molecules and the partial positive charge on the surface of the Ag -\nNPs which affects the mechanical response of the ternary nanocomposites \n(Fabra, Ta lens and Chiralt, 2008; Shameli  et al, 2010; Aguirre, Borneo and \nLe\u00f3n, 2013) . \n \n6.2.

Chapter 2  \n~ 265 ~ \n the amorphous ch aracter of the commercial PLA used in this study. No \ncrystallization or melting phenomena were detected.  The addition of Ag -\nNPs to PLA (PLA/Ag) did not reveal significant differences with respect \nto neat PLA in terms of T g (p > 0.05), in agreement with Fortunati et al \n(Fortunati, Rinaldi , et al , 2014)  and with previous results obtained in this \nwork for dog -bone bars . However, as expected from the result s already \ndiscussed for injection moulded samples, thymol -containing binary and \nternary nanocomposite films showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in \nTg values with differences higher than 10 \u00b0C with respect to the glass \ntransition temperature of neat PL A. This reduction in T g is related to the \nhigher mobility of the polymer macromolecules caused by the  increase of \nthe free volume in the matrix, promoting the torsion oscillation of the \ncarbon backbone due to the plasticizing effect induced by the addition  of \nthymol. It is well known that the addition of low molecular weight \ncompounds decreases PLA toughness by reducing the glass transition \ntemperature and increasing the mobility of macromolecules (Gon\u00e7alves  et \nal, 2013) . A similar shift to lower temperatures in T g was observed by the \nincorporation of thym ol to PP matrix producing a plasticization effect, as \ndiscussed in Chapter 1. A significant decrease in T g was also reported by \nother authors for PLA -based films with thymol (Tawakkal, Cran and \nBigger, 2014; Wu, Qin , et al , 2014) . A similar behaviour was reported for \n\u03b1-tocopherol, resveratrol, BHT and tert -butylhydroquinone added to PLA \n(Byun, Kim and Whiteside, 2010; Hwang  et al, 2012; Gon\u00e7 alves  et al, \n2013) . In all cases, an effective plasticizing effect was observed, resulting \nin the decrease in T g. \nThe thermal stability of neat PLA and the active nanocomposite films was \nstudied by TGA under nitrogen atmosphere.

A  first degradation step s tarting at 120 \u00b0C was \nalso detected (data not shown), which could be related to the thymol \ndegradation. This result confirms, once again, the permanence of a \ndetectable amount of thymol in the PLA -based nanocomposites after \nprocessing.  \nThe main TGA paramet ers obtained, i.e. T ini determined at 5 % weight \nloss, and T max for the main peak associated to the PLA thermal \ndegradation, are shown in  Table 2. 10. As can be observed, the separate \naddition of thymol and Ag -NPs into PLA did not significantly affect the \nthermal behaviour of the polymer matrix in terms of T max and T ini (p > \n0.05). However, the significant reduction observed in these parameters \ncaused by  the combined addition of Ag -NPs and thymol in ternary \nsystems suggests some decrease in the PLA thermal stability ( p < 0.05) for \nthe active nanocomposite ternary films . This phenomenon was related \nwith some degradation of these materials during processing . \n \nResults and Discussion . Chapter 2  \n~ 267 ~ \n Table 2. 10.

The evaluation of the light \ntransmission in the visible region (500 nm) revealed that all binary and \nternary films with thymol and Ag -NPs were, in general, highly transparent, \nshowing transmittance values higher than 90 % in all cases. A slight \ndecrease (p < 0.05) in transmittance was observed in binary systems \nResults and Discussion . Chapter 2  \n~ 271 ~ \n containing thymol, which might be due to the colourless transparent \nappearance of this additive.  \nOn the other hand, the inclusion of Ag -NPs into PLA films also produced \nsome significant reduction ( p < 0.05) in transparency, which was related \nto the prevention of light transmission by the nanoparticles \nhomogeneously dispersed through the polymer matrix  (Kanmani and \nRhim, 2014a) . Results suggest that the amount of both additives, thymol \nand Ag -NPs, used in these formulations did not affect dramatically the \ncolour and transparency of PLA films. Therefore, their incorporation into \nthe PLA matrix could be suitable for food packaging applications without \ncompromising to an u nacceptable degree its optical properties.  \n \n6.2.4.  Barrier properties  \nResults of the effect of the addition of thymol and Ag -NPs on the barrier \nproperties (OTR and WVP) of PLA -based films are shown in Table 2. 10. \nBiofilms with low oxygen permeability are desirable for food preservation \nas oxygen can accelerate lipids oxidation and facilitate the growth of \naerobic microorganisms, thereby shortening the food she lf-life (Pagno  et \nal, 2015) . The OTR \u00b7e values obtained in this study showed that the \noxygen barrier offered by neat PLA was not significantly modified (p > \n0.05) in the presence of additives.  \nThe study of the water vapour barrier properties of biofilms is important \nto assess their possible performance as food packaging materials since one \nof their main functions is to decrease the moisture transfer between food \nand the surrounding en vironment keeping food quality and increasing \nshelf-life (Siracusa, Rocculi, Romani and Rosa, 2008) . Water vapour \nbarrier in biofilms could be considered as the balance between the \nhydrophobic/hydrophilic characteristics of all their components. In our \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 2  \n~ 272 ~ \n case, WVP of PLA films was not significantly  affected (p > 0.05) by the \nincorporation of Ag -NPs (PLA/Ag). This behaviour may be due to the \nspherical shape of silver particles and their homogeneous dispersion in the \npolymer matrix which may not develop efficiently the tortuous pathway \nnecessary to re tard water vapour diffusion (Rhim and Wang, 2014) . \nIt has been stated that high water vapour permeability of films intended \nfor food packaging could restrict considerably their use (S\u00e1nchez -\nGonz\u00e1lez, Vargas, Gonz\u00e1lez -Mart\u00ednez, Chiralt and Ch\u00e1fer, 2011) . In this \ncase, the addition of thymol to PLA -based films resulted in a significant \ndecrease (p < 0.05) in WVP values for binary and ternary systems, up to \n40 % compared to thos e values obtained for the neat PLA film. These \nresults could be explained by the repulsion to water molecules caused by \nthe addition of hydrophobic components, such as thymol, at high \nconcentrations (L\u00f3pez -Mata  et al , 2013) . Therefore, these thymol -\ncontaining nanocomposites allowed an important improvement in barrier \nproperties to water vapour, which is a remarkable feature in food \npackaging applications, especially at high RH storage conditions.  Similar \nresults were found by other authors under the same conditions (23 \u00b0C, \n45% RH), reporting a WVP value of 1.99 x 10-14 kg m m-2 s-1 Pa-1 for neat \nPLA, and a 25 % reduction in WVP for PLA films loaded with 4 wt% \u03b1 -\ntocopherol (Gon\u00e7alves  et al, 2013) . Meanwhile, the addition of 2 wt% \nmarigold flower extract containing astaxanthin resulted in the decrease in \n21 % in WVP of PLA, which was attributed to the hydrophobic nature of \nthis extract (Samsu din, Soto -Valdez and Auras, 2014) . \n \n \n \n \nResults and Discussion . Chapter 2  \n~ 273 ~ \n 6.3. Quantification of thymol in PLA -based films after processing  \nThe quantification of the actual amount of thymol present in the \nprocessed active films is an important issue since the high volatility of this \nadditive could result in losses during extrusion and further film \nmanufacturing at high temperatures. The final amount of thymol detected \nin binary and ternary formulations  after processing is shown in Table 2. 10. \nResults are indicative that the losses of thymol were lower than 30 %, \nregardless of the initial amount used in the formulations (6 or 8 wt %). \nThese results can be considered acceptable and  were reduced to the \nminimum by the optimization of processing conditions as previously \ndiscussed, allowing thymol to be inside the extruder for the minimum \ntime to achieve a good dispersion into the polymer matrix. Therefore, it \ncan be expected that the r emaining amount of thymol in these PLA -based \nfilms after processing is high enough to obtain acceptable properties in \nterms of antibacterial activity, as it will be further discussed. Other authors \nhave also reported some losses of volatile additives durin g processing. In \nthis sense, losses of c atechin and epicatechin during processing  \nincorporated to PLA matrices were reported in the range of 20 -35 %, \nwhere processing temperature, residence time of PLA into the extruder \nand the additives concentration main ly influenced their permanence in the \nfinal blends (I\u00f1iguez -Franco  et al, 2012) . Moreover, losses of astaxanthin \nfrom marigold flower extract added to PLA up to 80 % were reported \n(Samsudin, Soto -Valdez and Auras, 2014) . \nPLA/Ag/T8 nanocomposites showed a significantl y higher amount of \nthymol (p < 0.05) remaining after processing (around 76 %) ( Table 2. 10). \nThis result may indicate that the loss of thymol could be i nfluenced by the \npresence of Ag -NPs, which could play a role in retarding the diffusion of \nthymol molecules through the polymer structure. A similar effect was \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 2  \n~ 274 ~ \n observed by Efrati et al for active films based on LDPE with thymol and \ndifferent contents of MMTs.

Identification of thymol and Ag -NPs in PLA -based films  \nFTIR and UV -Vis absorption spectra of PLA and PLA active \nnanocomposite films are shown in Figure 2. 23a and Figure 2. 23b, \nrespectively. FTIR results confirmed the presence of a significant amount \nof thymol remaining in th e nanocomposite films after processing, since \nthe flexion vibration of the methylene group (CH 2) at 806 cm-1 (see \nzoomed area in Figure 2. 23a) was observed for all formulations containing \nthymol, a clear indication of the presence of the additive in the processed \nformulations.  \nThe presence of thymol in binary and ternary systems a fter processing was \nalso confirmed by UV -Vis spectrophotometry ( Figure 2. 23b). Thymol \nshows maximum absorption in this region ( \u03bbmax) at 274 nm, corresp onding \nto the characteristic band of the \u03c0 -\u03c0* transition, also due to the \nauxochrome phenolic hydroxyl group in its structure (Rukmani and \nSundrarajan, 2011) . Furthermore, those formulations with Ag -NPs \nshowed a low -intensity but characteristic band at the visible region around \n400 nm, which some authors correlated with the surfac e plasmon \nresonance (SPR) transition peak (Vigneshwaran, Nachane, \nBalasubramanya and Varadarajan, 2006; Shameli  et al, 2010; Kanmani and \nRhim, 2014a) . \n~ 275 ~ \n  \nFigure 2. 23.

Chapter 2  \n~ 279 ~ \n PLA/Ag/T8 showed the highest disintegration rate followed by \nPLA/Ag/T6 highlighting the high influence of thymol in the diffusion \nprocess of water molecules through the p olymer structure, promoting \nhydrolysis due to the increase in chain mobility induced by the plasticizing \neffect already discussed. This behaviour was improved by the \nhomogeneous dispersion of thymol into the PLA matrix, as it was \nobserved in FESEM microgra phs. In addition, the hydroxyl groups in \nthymol can contribute to the heterogeneous hydrolysis of the PLA matrix \nafter absorbing water from the composting medium, resulting in a \nnoticeable increase in disintegrability values for PLA nanocomposites with \nthymol after 14 days. In the initial stages of the composting test, some \ninteractions between the thymol hydroxyl groups and water molecules \nwith formation of hydrogen bonds could retain the hydrolysis process \ncompensating the higher water diffusion rate in s amples with thymol. This \neffect is no longer observable after 14 days. A similar behaviour was \nreported by Sinha Ray et al, who suggested that 14 days could be \nconsidered the critical time to start the heterogeneous hydrolysis process \n(Sinha Ray, Yamada, Okamoto and Ueda, 2003) , as observed in this study.  \nThe presence of hydroxyl groups in the thymol molecules, finely dispersed \nin the PLA matrix, are responsible of the formation o f labile bonds in the \npolymer structure and consequently the hydrolysis reaction is faster by \nformation of low molar mass chains (Sinha Ray, Yamada, Okamoto and \nUeda, 2003; Proikakis, Mamouzelos, Tarantili and Andreopoulos, 2006) . \nThis effect could be even reinforced by synergies between Ag -NPs and \nthymol, since A g atoms could catalyse the disintegration process \n(Fortunati, Armentano, Iannoni , et al , 2012) . \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 2  \n~ 280 ~ \n Finally, after 57 testing days, it was observed that all PLA nanocomposites \nappeared totally disintegrated satisfying the ISO Standard requirements \nfor a biodegradable material (UNE -EN_20200, 2006) . \nThe evolution of thermal, chemical and morphological properties upon \ndisintegrability tests was also studied for injection moulded samples.  \n \nStructural ana lysis \nPLA/Ag/T8 nanocomposites submitted to composting conditions up to \n21 days were analysed by FTIR and the most relevant spectra are reported \nin Figure 2. 27. The typical stretching band of the carbonyl group ( -C=O) \nat 1750 cm-1, attributed to lactide, and the -C-O- bond stretching band in \nthe PLA -CH-O- group at 1180 cm-1 were identified (Shameli  et al, 2010) . \nAs previously discussed, the hydrolytic degradation in PLA takes place \nduring the initial phases of the compostin g treatment, where the high \nmolar mass PLA chains are hydrolysed to form low molar mass oligomers \nwith plenty of available and highly reactive hydroxyl and carboxylic acid \ngroups (Fukushima, Abbate, Tabuani, Gennari and Camino, 2009) . \nFTIR spectra after 21 days showed a considerable decrease in the intensity \nof the peak related to the carbonyl group ( -C=O) at 1750 cm-1 and the \nsimultaneous a ppearance of a typical IR absorption corresponding to \ncarbonyl groups in carboxylic acids formed by the hydrolytic scission of \nthe ester groups (Fukushima, Feijoo and Yang, 2012) . In addition, the \nband at 1180 cm-1 corresponding to the -C-O- stretching practically \ndisappeared after 7 treatment days as already reported by other authors \n(Fortunati, Armentano, Iannoni , et al , 2012) .

However, these samples developed multiple \nendothermic peaks just after 7 days. These peaks are related to the \nformation of crystalline structures with different perfection degrees in the \nPLA matrix during degradation, which was promoted by the hydrolysis \nprocess. Similar results were already reported by other authors, who \nsuggested that the appearance of multiple melting peaks could be related \nto the formation of different crystal structures due to the PLA chain \nscission produced during the degradation process (Fukushima, Abbate, \nTabuani, Gennari and Camino, 2009; Fortunati, Armen tano, Iannoni , et al , \n2012; Gorrasi and Pantani, 2013) . \nDSC thermograms recorded during the second heating scan did not reveal \nany crystallization and melting peaks, as it was  expected. However, it was \nobserved that T g values decreased with the testing time, upon 21 days of \nstudy ( Figure 2. 30). This behaviour could be assoc iated with the increase \nin the mobility of the polymer chains as a consequence of hydrolysis and \nformation of low molar mass oligomers, producing some plasticizing \neffect (Sinha Ray, Yamada, Okamoto and Ueda, 2003; Proikakis, \nMamouzelos, Tarantili and Andreopoulos,  2006; Burgos, Martino and \nJim\u00e9nez, 2013; Gorrasi and Pantani, 2013) .

Chapter 2  \n~ 287 ~ \n 2.31). A similar behaviour was reported by Fortunati  et al, indicating that \nthe PLA hydrolysis begins in the amorphous region of the polymer \nstructure producing an overall increase in the polymer crystallinity \n(Fortunati, Rinaldi , et al, 2014) . Furthermore, the results obtained before \nthe beginning of the burial test suggest the influence of thymol on PLA \ndegradation, since significantly higher disintegration values were obtained \nfor PLA/T6, PLA/T8, PLA/Ag/T6 and PLA/Ag/T8 compared to PLA \nor PLA/Ag samples (p < 0.05). As previously discussed, the thymol \nhydroxyl groups can contribute to the PLA hydrolysis after absorbing \nwater from the composting medium, resulting in a noticeable increase in \ndisintegrability values for thymol -contain ing PLA nanocomposites.  \nAfter 4 days of treatment, no significant differences (p > 0.05) were \nobserved for all samples regardless of their composition ( Figure 2. 32), \nshowing similar weight loss and disintegrability ratio. It should be also \nhighlighted that the testing temperature (58 \u00b0C) was higher than the glass \ntransition temperature of the nanocomposites, previously reported in the \n40-45 \u00baC range, res ulting in some induction of the crystallization process \ninto the amorphous zones in the polymer matrix and chain mobility, \naccelerating the hydrolytic degradation process. This behaviour could also \nbe related to the low thickness of the tested samples (Fortunati, \nArmentano, Iannoni , et al, 2012) . \nIt was observed that after 14 days of composting test all films reached the \ndegradation values higher than 90 % (as indicated in the ISO 20200 \nstandard for a biodegradable material ).

Results were well below the legislation limits for silver (0.05 mg \nAg kg-1 food) (EFSA, 2005)  although there is not a specific legislation for \nAg-NPs.  Echegoyen et al described the release of Ag -NPs as a \nsuperposition of two simultaneous processes: a surface release and the \noxidative dissolution of silver into the ethanol medium. Therefore, the \nsilver species present in ethanol solutions and detected in our tests aft er \n10 days of contact probably correspond to Ag+ ions liberated by the \noxidation of the Ag -NPs (Song, Li, Lin, Wu and Chen, 2011; Echegoyen \nand Ner\u00edn, 2013) .

Thymol release  \nTable 2. 12 also shows the amount of thymol released after 10 days of \ncontact between films and ethanol 10 % (v/v) at 40 \u00b0C. As expected, \nthymol release increased at high contents, showing significant differences \nbetween all formulations (p < 0.05). The highest migra tion levels were \nobtained for the ternary systems; in particular PLA/Ag/T8 (34.0 \u00b1 1.7 mg \n(kg simulant )-1). This result could give an indication of some protection of Ag -\nNPs to limit thymol losses during processing permitting the preservation \nof the active component and limiting losses at the extrusion temperatures. \nThis effect was also observed by Efrati et al when blending thymol with \ndifferent clays (Efrati  et al, 2014) , concluding that the increase in the clay \ncontent permitted the significant reductionin thymol losses during \nprocessing.  \nIn this context, the release kinetics of thymol in ethanol 10 % (v/v) was \nstudied for 15 days ( Figure 2. 33). As it can be seen, the incorporation of \nAg-NPs into the polymer matrix resulted in the increase of the total \namount of migrated thymol. Although migration tests were carried out for \nResults and Discussion . Chapter 2  \n~ 291 ~ \n 15 days, it can be observed that the migration steady state was not cle arly \nreached for the whole testing time ( Figure 2. 33). Therefore, the estimation \nof the maximum concentration of thymol able to migrate in ethanol 10 % \n(v/v) at t \u2192\u221e, C\u221e, was performed by using the Weibull approach \n(Equation 2.1 5) (see solid lines in Figure 2. 33), \n \n                                                                (2.15) \nwhere Ct is the cumulative concentration (ppm) of thymol (mass of \nthymol per kilogram of food simulant) released at time t, and k\u2019 and d are \nconstant values. Initially, based on empirical observations, Equation (2.1 5) \ncan be used for a first assessment of the diffusion mechanism, since d and \nk\u2019 are closely related to the mechanism and rate release constant, \nrespectively (Papadopoulou, Kosmidis, Vlachou and Macheras, 2006; \nCosta, Valente, Miguel and Queir oz, 2011) . It can be  seen that the fit of \nC\u221e values increased with the incorporation of Ag -NPs to the PLA matrix \naccording to previous results, which related some protection of Ag -NPs \nto thymol losses (Table 2. 13). \u0725\u0750=\u0725\u221e[1\u2212exp(\u2212\u0747\u2032\u0750)\u0740] \nResults and Discussion.

The validity of Equation (2.1 6) is restricted to \nCt/C\u221e < 0.60.  \nThe mean dissolution time ( MDT ), which characterizes the thymol release \nrate from a given matrix to indicate the thymol -release -retarding efficiency \nof the polymer (Costa, Valente, Miguel and Queiroz, 2011)  can be \ncalculated through Equation (2.1 7). \n \u0725\u0750\u0725\u221e\u0d57 =\u0750\u0747\u074a \nResults and Discussion.

This effect occurs when the permeant mobility and \nthe polymer segment  relaxation rates are similar. It is known that ethanol \ncan act as an aggressive solvent being able to be sorbed by PLA \n(Manzanarez -L\u00f3pez, Soto -Valdez, Auras and Peralta, 2011)  leading to a \nplasticizer -like effect (Mascheroni, Guillard, Nalin, Mora and Piergiovanni, \n2010) , with the consequence of molecular rearrangements caused by the \nincrease in mobility of the polymer chain (Mutsuga, Kawamura and \nTanamoto, 2008) . In this case, it was previously reported that PLA \nmatrices in contact wi th ethanol 10 % (v/v) suffer some molecular \nmodifications leading to the additives release (Fortunati, Peltzer , et al , \n2012) . \nIt is worth noticing that the use of Equations (2.1 5) to (2.1 7) allows to \nconclude that there is a close relationship between the fitting parameter k\u2019 \nand ( MDT )\u22121 respectively, following the function ( MDT )\u22121 = 1.49 (\uf0b10.06) \nk\u2019 (R2=0.9929), indicating the validity of both semi -empirical equations to \ncharacterize the migration rate of thymol in these PLA matrices. \nFurthermore, it could be verified that the migration rate calculated taking \ninto account the overall range time was moderately higher than that \nobtained for short -range times, in agreement with the proposed Non -\nFickian mechanism.  \nHowever, a more accurate assessment on the migration rate should be \ncarried out on the basis of physical grounds.

Chapter 2  \n~ 295 ~ \n thymol from the PLA -based films was evaluated by using the Lagergren \nfirst-order and pseudo -second order rate equations (A\u015f\u00e7i, A\u00e7ikel and \nA\u00e7ikel, 2012) , which can be written, respectively, in their linear form as  \n \n                                                                (2.18) \n                                                                               (2.19) \nwhere Ce and Ct are the amounts of thymol migrated into the food \nsimulant (mg L\u22121) at equilibrium and at time t, respectively, and k1 and k2 \nare the Lagergren pseudo -first order (s\u22121) and pseudo -second order rate (L \nmg\u22121 s\u22121) constants, respectively.  \nFigure 2. 34 shows the representative plots of the fitting of linearized \nforms of Equations (2.1 8) and (2.1 9) to experimenta l data. From this \nanalysis, joined to the fitting parameters summarized in Table 2. 14, it can \nbe concluded that the pseudo -second order model showed hi gher \ncorrelation coefficients. It was also observed that, considering the \nassociated imprecision, Ce values agreed well with C\u221e which have been \ninitially estimated and reported in Table 2. 13. Both facts suggest that \nmigration of thymol from PLA -based films follows a pseudo -second \norder kinetics, which relies on the assumption that physisorption is not \nthe rate -limiting step (Ho, 2006) , in agreement with the mechanism \ndescribed by Equation (2.1 6). \u074a\u0748(\u0725\u0741\u2212\u0725\u0750)=ln(\u0725\u0741)\u2212\u07471\u0750 \n\u0750\n\u0725\u0750=1\n\u072d2\u0725\u07412+1\n\u0725\u0741\u0750 \nResults and Discussion.

The results obtained for all migration extracts from active \nnanocomposite films at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 hours and 5, 10 and 15 days \nfollowed a similar pattern related to the scavenging ability on DPPH \nradicals.  Table 2. 12 shows the results for the AO performance of all \nformulations obtained after 10 days in contact with ethanol 10 % (v/v). \nAs expected, the scavenging activity against the DPPH radical followed a \nsimilar behaviour than migration results. The amount of thymol present in \neach extract increased with time and in consequence, the AO activity was \nhigher. The dependence between the amount of AO released and the \nobtained scavenging activity was also observed by Delgado et al and in a \nprevious study in PP -based films u sing thymol and carvacrol as active \nadditives (Delgado  et al, 2014) . \nResults and Discussion.

Chapter 2  \n~ 300 ~ \n A slight reduction in the bacterial growth was observed for binary systems \ncontaining thymol against Escherichia coli showing no significant differences \n(p > 0.05) after 3 and 24 h of incubation. Moreover, these films \nsignificantly inhibited the growth of Sthaphylococcus aureus after 3 h. These \nresults are in agreement with those obtained in a previous study where the \nconcentration of thymol added into PP films was not enough to inhibit \nthe growth of Escherichia coli . The AM activity of thymol has been \nproposed as consisting on binding to membrane proteins by means of \nhydrogen bonding, thereby changing the permeability characteristics of \nthe membrane. Therefore, the AM activity of thymol is strongly \ndependent on the physico -chemical characteristics and compo sition of the \nbacterial membranes (Trombetta  et al, 2005) . The mechanism of action is \nbased on the disturbance of the cytoplasmic bacterial membrane, \ndisrupting the proton motive force (PMF), electron flow, active transport \nand coagulation of cell contents (Burt, 2004) . In fact, most studies \ninvestigating the action of EOs and their components against food \nspoilage organisms and foodborne pathogens agree that, generally, all \nthese compounds (including thymol) are more active against Gram -\npositive than against Gram -negativ e bacteria, such as Escherichia coli , since \nthey possess an outer layer surrounding the cell wall, primarily composed \nof lipids, proteins and lipopolysaccharides and forming a hydrophilic \npermeability barrier providing protection against the diffusion of \nhydrophobic compounds through them. In contrast, the cell wall of \nGram -positive bacteria, such as Sthaphylococcus aureus , does not contain \nlipopolysaccharides and, consequently, thymol can be more susceptible to \ninhibit its growth (Feng  et al, 2000; Maneerung, Tokura and Rujiravanit, \n2008) . \nResults and Discussion . Chapter 2  \n~ 301 ~ \n Active nanocomposite film s containing Ag -NPs showed relevant \nantibacterial activity against both tested bacteria obtaining significant \ndifferences (p < 0.001) for each incubation time at 3 and 24 h compared \nto the PLA control film. The antibacterial activity of ternary \nnanocomposi tes was higher with Sthaphylococcus aureus than with Escherichia \ncoli regardless of the incubation time and temperatures, confirming similar \nresults reported by other authors (Kv\u00edtek et al, 2008; Jokar, Abdul \nRahman, Ibrahim, Abdullah and Tan, 2012) . Erem et al evaluated the \nantibacterial activity of PLA fibres with Ag -NPs against Sthaphylococcus \naureus and Klebsiella pneumonia  (Gram -negative) bacteria, concluding that \nAg-NPs were more effective against Sthaphylococcus aureus (Erem, Ozcan, \nErem and Skrifvars,  2013) . These results may be also attributed to the \nstructure and mode of antibacterial action of Ag -NPs as well as to \ndifferences in the cell wall structure of Gram -positive and Gram -negative \ncells (Jokar, Abdul Rahman, Ibrahim, Abdullah and Tan,  2012; Reidy, \nHaase, Luch, Dawson and Lynch, 2013) . \nHowever, the mechanism of action of Ag -NPs has not been well \nestablished and several possibilities have been proposed to explain the \nAM activity of Ag -NPs. Some authors have focused on cell membrane \ndisruption due to the interaction  of Ag -NPs with phosphorous and \nsulphur containing compounds of proteins, preventing DNA replication. \nOther studies focused on the binding of the positively charged Ag -NPs \nwith negatively charged bacterial cell membranes, disrupting cell walls and \nsurface proteins. A third mechanism is related to the penetration of Ag -\nNPs into bacteria, which inactivates enzymes producing H 2O2. All these \npossible mechanisms finally lead to the cells death (Kanmani and Rhim, \n2014a) . Furthermor e, some studies have also shown that the toxicity of \nAg-NPs vary significantly depending on their dimensions and shape, since \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 2  \n~ 302 ~ \n small nanoparticles have larger relative surface areas for the Ag+ release, \nwith higher protein binding efficiencies and passing easily through pores \nin bacterial membranes (Duncan, 2011) . \nThe effect of temperature on the antibacterial activity efficiency of PLA \nand PLA -based nanocomposite films w ith thymol and Ag -NPs was also \ninvestigated. R esults for the studied films  showed their high activity \nagainst both tested bacteria obtaining significant differences (p < 0.001) \nfor each incubation temperature at 3 and 24 h compared to the PLA \ncontrol sampl e, and slight differences between both bacteria.  The \npresence of thymol results in increasing the antibacterial effect of Ag -NPs \ndue to the bacterial membranes damage caused by thymol. The presence \nof both active agents (thymol and Ag -NPs) may cross the ce ll membranes \nmore efficiently, penetrating the interior of cells and interacting with \nintracellular critical sites for the antibacterial activity. This fact could be \nrelated with the higher amount of Ag and thymol released from the PLA \nmatrix when both add itives are incorporated, since it could be suggested \nthat bacteria inactivation is most likely caused by the Ag+ ions release. \nFurther studies need to be performed to elucidate this aspect since the \namount of silver and thymol released depends on several f actors as it has \nbeen previously mentioned in the migration results.  \n \n7. Conclusions  \nActive nanocomposites based on PLA, thymol and silver nanoparticles \nwere successfully processed by extrusion in the form of injection moulded \nsamples and films and they were further characterized in terms of thermal, \noptical, mechanical, morphological, and barrier properties. Disintegrability \nunder composting conditions was also studied. The applicability of films \nResults and Discussion . Chapter 2  \n~ 303 ~ \n to food packaging was also evaluated by evaluating their migrat ion, \nantibacterial and antioxidant performance.  \nThe identification of Ag -NPs and thymol into the PLA matrix was \nsuccessfully carried out. FESEM micrographs showed good distribution \nof both additives through the PLA matrix, with homogenous surfaces and \nhighlighting the presence of silver nanoparticles successfully embedded \ninto the polymer matrix. Moreover, the determination of thymol by \nHPLC -UV demonstrated that this additive remains after processing in a \nsignificant amount and could act as active additive.  \nThe combination of both additives influenced PLA thermal properties. \nDSC results showed that the addition of thymol resulted in a decrease in \nthe T g of PLA, favouring some plasticization of the polymer matrix. The \npresence of thymol and Ag -NPs into the PL A-based films also influenced \nthe thermal stability of the ternary systems. An enhancement in the barrier \nproperties to water vapour was also obtained by the incorporation of \nthymol, providing improved protection to packaged food.  \nThe degradation study of all active nanocomposites under composting \nconditions showed that the inherent biodegradable character of PLA was \nimproved by the addition of thymol and Ag -NPs, getting a faster \ndegradation rate and meeting the biodegradation legal requirements.  \nActive nan ocomposite films containing Ag -NPs and thymol, in particular \nPLA/Ag/T8, showed positive results concerning antibacterial and AO \nactivity, demonstrating their effectiveness in the inhibition of the growth \nof foodborne bacteria and the radical scavenging inh ibition by DPPH \nmethod. The amount of thymol and Ag -NPs released into aqueous food \nsimulant suggested that the release of thymol is influenced by the presence \nof Ag -NPs in the PLA matrix.  \nResults and Discussion. Chapter 2  \n~ 304 ~ \n In conclusion, PLA/Ag/T8 showed potential to be applied as bio -based  \nactive film with biodegradable character and AM and AO properties to \nextend the shelf -life of food products.  \n \n8.

General Conclusions  \n \nGeneral Conclusions  \n~ 319 ~ \n According to the proposed objectives and the results obtained in the \npresent work, the following conclusions can be obtained:  \nI. PP-based active films containing 4, 6 and 8 wt% of thymol \nand/or carvacrol were obtained by melt -blending and \ncompression -moulding and further characterized by using \ndifferent analytical techniqu es. The active films showed their \nhomogeneity after processing despite, certain porosity observed \nby SEM at the highest additives concentration (8 wt%). Some \ndecrease in the elastic modulus was observed for the active \nformulations compared with neat PP. Th e presence of additives \ndid not affect the thermal stability of PP, but resulted in some \ndecrease in crystallinity and oxygen barrier properties. The \npresence of thymol and carvacrol also increased the stabilization \nagainst thermo -oxidative degradation of PP-based films, with \nhigher oxidation induction parameters when using 8 wt% of \nthymol and carvacrol; suggesting that the polymer is well \nstabilized and a certain amount of these compounds remained in \nthe polymer matrix after processing.  \nII. The incorporation of 8 wt% of carvacrol and thymol as active \nadditives into PP films for food packaging resulted in the \npossibilities of their controlled release with possible activity in \nprotecting food from oxidative and microbiological degradation. \nAnalytical methods for  the determination of the target \ncompounds in aqueous and fatty food simulants were successfully \ndeveloped and validated. The release of the studied additives \nfrom films was dependent on the food simulant used in the tests \nand their amount effectively inco rporated into the polymer \nmatrix. Diffusion coefficients were calculated and a Fickian -type \nGeneral Conclusions  \n~ 320 ~ \n model was developed for the release kinetics of thymol and \ncarvacrol. The addition of thymol and carvacrol in PP -based films \nshowed higher inhibition against Gram -positive bacteria, in \nparticular for thymol. PP -based active films were also tested in \ndirect contact with food, clearly increasing the quality and shelf -\nlife of strawberries and bread samples.  \nIII. Active nanocomposite films based on PLA with a commercial \norgan o-modified montmorillonite were prepared with 2.5 and 5 \nwt% of D43B and 8 wt% of thymol by melt -blending and \ncompression -moulding. Around 70 -75 % of thymol remained in \nthe active nanocomposites after processing, ensuring their \nposterior applicability in ac tive systems. These films showed an \nintercalated structure of the D43B nanoparticles through the \npolymer  matrix, exhibiting a  partial exfoliation in ternary \nnanocomposites, with thymol and D43B. Likewise, some decrease \nin toughness was observed due to some  slight plasticizing effect \ninduced by the presence of thymol, also observed by a clear \ndecrease in the PLA glass transition temperature. Nevertheless, \nthe addition of thymol did not significantly affect the thermal \nstability of PLA and oxygen barrier prop erties. Some differences \nin films colour were observed by the addition of thymol and \nD43B, being larger for films with the highest concentration of the \nnanoclay. Nevertheless, the intrinsic transparency of PLA was not \naffected by the addition of both compo nents resulting in fully \ntransparent active films.  \nIV. The release of thymol from PLA matrices was determined by \nHPLC -UV at different times and a kinetic model was proposed, \nsuggesting that the release of thymol was influenced by the \nGeneral Conclusions  \n~ 321 ~ \n presence of D43B since dif fusion coefficients were different for \nbinary and ternary nanocomposites. The continuous release of \nthymol favoured the antioxidant activity of these films in contact \nwith food, which was determined by using the \nspectrophotometric DPPH method, resulting in  a high percentage \nof inhibition. Finally, the addition of D43B showed some effect \nin the improvement in the antibacterial activity of thymol -based \nfilms, with higher inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus  than \nagainst Escherichia coli . \nV. Ag-NPs (1 wt%) an d thymol (6 and 8 wt%) were added into PLA \nmatrices to obtain active nanocomposites and processed by \nextrusion, successfully obtaining injection moulded samples and \nfilms. FESEM micrographs showed the good distribution of both \nadditives all through the PLA  matrix, resulting in an improvement \nin water vapour barrier properties. Some plasticization of the \npolymer matrix could be related with the addition of thymol and \nthe consequent decrease in the glass transition temperature. \nLikewise, the presence of thymo l and Ag -NPs into the PLA -\nbased films also had some influence on the thermal stability of \nthe ternary systems, slightly decreasing the PLA behaviour at high \ntemperatures.  \nVI. Active nanocomposite films containing Ag -NPs and thymol \nshowed positive results conce rning antibacterial and antioxidant \nactivities, demonstrating their effectiveness in the inhibition of \nthe growth of foodborne bacteria and in the radical scavenging \nactivity . The amount of thymol and Ag -NPs released into \naqueous food simulants suggested t hat the release of thymol was \ninfluenced by the presence of Ag -NPs in the PLA matrix \nGeneral Conclusions  \n~ 322 ~ \n resulting in some protection of the nanoparticles to the thymol \nrelease.  \nVII. The degradation study of all active nanocomposites under \ncomposting conditions showed that the inh erent biodegradable \ncharacter of PLA remained after the incorporation of the active \nadditive and the nanoparticles. In fact, the incorporation of 8 \nwt% of thymol to PLA -based formulations increased the \ndisintegration rate of the polymer matrix, due to the presence of \nthe reactive free hydroxyl groups. The combination of thymol \nand Ag -NPs or thymol and D43B induced higher degradation \nrates, suggesting their advantages in industrial applications where \nbiodegradation could be an issue, such as in food packagin g. \nVIII. In summary, PLA -based films with 2.5 wt% of D43B and 8 wt% \nof thymol and PLA -based films with 1 wt% of Ag -NPs and 8 \nwt% of thymol showed their potential as bio -based active films \nwith biodegradable character and antimicrobial/antioxidant \nperformance to extend the shelf -life and quality of food products.  \n \nAs a general conclusion , it could be stated that the addition of phenolic \ncompounds, such as carvacrol and thymol, to conventional or bio -based \nand biodegradable polymers for food packaging showed high p otential to \nimprove quality and safety aspects of the packed food. It should be \nhighlighted that these systems could be a valid and successful commercial \nalternative to the current antioxidant/antimicrobial formulations in food \nindustry, most of them invol ving the direct addition of chemicals to food.  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
