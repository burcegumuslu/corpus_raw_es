So, that is where the toxicology comes in, nanotechnology as the name\nwould automatically say, this is dealing with how the nano part of it or the nano property\nof your device is causing toxicity to the body. So, how can one go about doing this.\nSo, in general since these are nanomaterials these can penetrate into a smaller structures\nmuch more easily ,they can move much deeper into the passageways and tissues then\nlarger particles. So, again if just to give you a very simple example let us say I have this\npen this cannot penetrate through my skin it is too big unless of course, it is been given a\nlot of momentum and it damages the tissue. It cannot go through my skin, but when we\ntalk about these particles it is such a minute range my skins my skin may itself be porous\nand some of these can go through.\nWe have talked about transdermal delivery; we have talked about various kinds of\ndelivery. So, it is then fairly feasible for some of these particles to be able to penetrate\nthrough the skin. So, again some of the reasons why this can happen is first of all they\nhave a very high surface area and so they have a lot more reaction site per unit, hence\nthey are very reactive. So, what do I mean here is a let us say, so the volume is what for,\nbut let us say we take about sphere.\nV= 4\u03c0r3\n/3\nNow, let us say we are talking about, so this is basically the volume, then we have the\nsurface area which is nothing,\nSurface Area = 4\u03c0r2\nNow, if I am trying to compute for a given volume how much surface area is available.\nSo, what I can do, is I can just simply do the surface area by the volume. So, if I do that\nwill basically give me\n4\u03c0r2\n/(4\u03c0r3\n/3)\nand that is going to give me\nSurface Area/Volume = 3/r\nSo, what I am saying that as I am reducing the r, since r is in the denominator my surface\narea to volume ratio increases. So; obviously, this r for a macro object for let us say a\nsoccer ball or something else and this is in centimeters or millimetres, so at that point let\nus say it is in centimeters. So, we are talking about 3 by let us say 1 centimetre, so you\nget a certain ratio. But now I am some decreasing this it became millimeter this ratio\ngoes up by 10 times, so it becomes 10 x.\nSimilarly, if I decrease this down to a micron range. Now, I am talking about another\n1000 times so, 10000 times, I have increased the surface area for a given amount for the\ngiven volume. And then similarly if I go to now nanometer range I am talking about this\nincrement of 10 to the power 7. So, 4 and 3 here, 10 to the power 7 times I have\nincreasing surface to volume ratio.\nSo, this is what we will continue to do here in the field and we have also talked about it\nin the earlier classes that as you become more and more small your surface to volume\nratio increases. So, now what this means is a nano particle compared to a centimeter size\nparticle will have almost 10 to the power 7 which is 10 million times the surface area.\nThe way these material will interact with the various reagents, various things in the\nsurrounding is through the surface area. So, now, you have a lot more reactive sites\nwhich were earlier buried in the bulk volume, but they are now available on the surface.\nSo, again this is a good thing to have for that is why the nanoparticles are being used\nquite a lot, but then it comes with shaded side effects where they can also have some\ntoxicity induced through them.\n(Refer Slide Time: 06:11)\nSo, they can also produce reactive oxygen species, the this is much higher concerned\nwith metal based nanoparticles rather than the micro particles or the polymeric particles,\nbecause metals are a good oxidizing agent some of them good reducing agent. So, all of\nthis results in such as copper, nickel, iron they can create reactive oxygen species.\nNow again you have lot more surface area, so then amount of reactive oxygen species in\nthe being generated is quite high and these reactive oxygen species are also referred to as\nROS are a part of the inflammatory process. So, now, you are increasing the\ninflammation, if the inflammation is too much you may even have quite a lot of toxicity\nfever and things like that will come up.\nAnd this could be also present in polymeric particles too because lot of these polymers\nare required to have metals as catalysts. So, some of these we talked about PLGA\nrequires some catalyst from a synthesis from the lactide and the glycolide. So, these\nmetal could be present in some trace amount and they can again be causing this oxidative\nstress and inflammation.\n(Refer Slide Time: 07:31)\nSo, this is just one way, then we can break down this toxicology into various forms. So,\nlet us start with the inhalation since this is by far one of the most sort of a topic that is\ncurrently in a lot of debate with the air pollution in all these materials that are out there\nincluding some exhaust from the vehicles and all. So, any of us have heard this\nparticulate matter mid particulate material PM 10 PM 2.5 PM 1 and especially from\nburning waste. So, what are these PM 10 is nothing but a particle which is less than 10\nmicron.\nSo, any particle which is less than 10 micron is classified as PM 10, PM 2.5 is something\nthat is less than 2.5 micron and PM 1 is something that is less than 1 micron. So, you will\noften hear about people saying that the air quality is bad the PM 2.5 is very high, the PM\n1 is very high, the PM 10 is very high. That basically means that the air is carrying lots\nof these particles and flowing them around and we are breathing them in we are inhaling\nthem it is going and depositing in our lungs.\nSome of these material become quite high number if you have burning waste or if there\nis a building construction that is going on and a lot of a dust particles flying around. So,\ntypically this is a major issue with non degradable particles. Now, in cases of therapy we\nmake lots of these and people are now inhaling this something like a normal inhaler\nwhich people use in asthma. They are also exposing this to the environment and then this\nmay increase in number as more and more users comes in for these nano micro particle.\nSo, there is some toxicity associated with that is especially for non degradable particles,\nbecause degradable particles will go away ,will degrade either in the environment or in\nour own body, but then this non degradable particle will remain. So, these are easily\ninhalable and cause , weakened immune system, again like the metal particles these can\nalso result in the reactive oxygen species. As I said these macrophages they represent in\nthe lung they are the ones that are responsible for phagocytosis and in this case we are\nmainly talking about the alveolar macrophages.\nSo, these alveolar macrophages will try to engulf anything that is depositing in the lung\nand there is several of them, but then eventually if the load is very high of these PM 10\nPM 2.5 PM 1. They may reach a saturation level where they cannot engulf anymore, they\ncannot be graded, it is non degradable particle. So, where do these particles go is\nmacrophages will either become non functional or they will actually even become\naberrant and they start secreting lots of things for inflation for inflammation to kick in.\nAnd then some if the particles is actually very small then we know that these alveolar, let\nus say if this is an alveolar sac and this is a very thin membrane between a blood vessel\nand these alveolar. So, if they are extremely tiny particles they can actually go in through\nthis barrier and they may even reach heart and brain. So, even through inhalation you are\ncausing it to distribute systemically.\n(Refer Slide Time: 11:15)\nSo, and then there are some other routes as well for another toxicology and the one is\ndermal penetration which I briefly mentioned that things can go through your skin, there\nis IV injection. So; obviously, if you are designing these particles to be injected IV they\nmay still start to accumulate in the body and then of course, to the oral route if it is in a\ntablet form or in any other form. T he other things we should take care for all of these is\nthe hemo compatibility.\nSo, if it touches the blood whether it is actually or fertilizing the blood vessels and the\nRBCs, so RBC lysis a big concern. So, if we have a lot of RBC lysis is happening\nbecause these RBCs are interacting with these material then your blood count is\ndecreasing you may not have enough oxygen carrying capacity. So, oxygen capacity will\ngo down, the last thing you want is these particles may induce let us say blood clotting,\nso this is a separate thing.\nSo, something which we had discussed quite extensively in our inflammation part of this\ntopic, you know blood compatibility in which is the same thing, but essentially we are\ntalking here about clotting. So, if it induces clotting it may cause things like stroke and\nheart attack because these can go in and clog the blood vessels which are feeding either\nto your heart or to your brain.\nThen similarly this can result in complement activation which again is going to lead to\ninflammation, we discussed other ways as well right. We discussed that these one of the\npapers we had discussed which was the gold PAA particles that were causing Mac 1\nreceptor activation.\nSo, some of those processes may also be involved, it does not have to be directly\ncomplement or the clotting itself it may be is through some other way. And then finally,\nif the cells are taking it up and there are some mutagens and they may even cause cancer\nor loss of function for several cells.\nSo, all of these are some of the things that we need to keep in mind while we are\ndesigning nanotoxicology and that is why it becomes very important and we had gone\nover blood compatibility, immune system and complements all of this is again very very\nimportant. Because eventually most of these drugs will be given to patients who are\nsomewhat sick, they may not be as functionally active to fight off any challenge as let us\nsay a healthy person. And the last thing you want in the in case is to then make the\ndisease worse rather than letting it go in that normal scenario.\n(Refer Slide Time: 14:37)\nSo, how would you then go about testing this. So, again some of those things we have\ntalked about already throughout this course that whether it is compatible, whether you\ncan change the property, copolymerization, you can conjugate peg to make it more\nstealth. Some of these things we have discussed and then in the more systematic way we\nlook at here.\nSo, basically the testing of nanoparticle toxicity can be divided into four levels. So, one\nis to testing the activity of the nanoparticle in cellular and subcellular system. So, for\nexample, whether it causes radical generation whether it causes oxidation of a\nbiomolecules, protein and DNA, lipid peroxidation if there is a important enzyme\nwhether it is affects the enzyme, this is again just in a nature in the environment.\nSo, you have a tube, you have let us say DNA or any other bio molecule in here. You\nadd your particle suspension here and see if the function of this DNA or the bio molecule\nor whatever it is, whether it is enzyme or any structural changes are observed. You can\neven isolate mitochondria and test it quickly to see if the mitochondrial function is being\ndisrupted. So, these are some of the acellular systems that you can check.\nSo again as I said you can look for plasmid DNA degradation. So, let us say if I have a\nplasmid and I can run it through a page gel or an agarose gel and if I see that the band\nhas shifted or it is slightly moved up or down I can say that there is some process that is\nhappening, the DNA unwinding you can look for by melting temperatures. The second\nlevel that you will look at is more at a in vitro level.\nSo, this is looking at intact cells or the cell systems. So, you can you have lots of cell\nlines, you have macrophage cell lines, endothelial cell lines, epithelial cell lines, you can\ntake these cell lines and test your particles to them see whether the cells are dying.\n(Refer Slide Time: 16:59)\nSo, maybe in a dish you are culturing these cells and you can put your particle solution\nover these cells, you can culture them for different time points. Let us say 24 hour, 48\nhours and then look if the cells are alive or dead and if they are alive then how functional\nthey are. So, maybe look for some of the metabolic activity, some of these kids are\nreadily available in the market that you can used to test this out.\nThe same thing you can do with the RBCs, so hemolysis. So, whether the blood is\ngetting lysed with this; you can look for some enzyme leakage and to see whether the\nmembrane is disrupted in any way or you can look at immune cells to see if the immune\ncells are getting activated with this. So, some of these polymers can act as adjuvants, so\nyou want to make sure, if you do not want the immune get active you can then test these\nparticles on your immune cells and see if they are actually becoming active then you\ncannot use that for that application.\nThe other thing is testing the nanoparticle on an isolated organ, so you can have some\nprimary organs isolated. So, blood is a good example this is one of the organ that is very\nwidely used and then you can also use some intact skin models, there is lots of modelling\nthe 3D modelling of tissues have started. So, you can take these heart out, primary heart\nout, the cells have been alive for some time you can test your particles on those culture\nand see if any changes you are seeing compared to the control.\nAnd finally; obviously, the gold standard in this case is an in vivo testing. So, you use\nsome kind of a small animal you give these particles at the high doses and see if there is\nany functional or behavioural changes that you observe. Functional and behaviour\nchanges that you are observing in the such animals, so this is in a nutshell how you can\ndivide the nanoparticle toxicity.\n(Refer Slide Time: 19:21)\nA very fancy term to this is ADME. This is abbreviated form which is Absorption,\nDistribution, Metabolism and Excretion. So, any molecule, any material that you are\nusing you would like to do these studies to see how it is getting first absorbed. Once you\nhave injected, how it is then distributing in the system, how it is getting metabolized in\nthe system and finally, how it is coming out of the system. And which especially for non\ndegradable particle is a big concern because if they are above 6-10 nanometer, they\ncannot come out, so they will accumulate ok.\n(Refer Slide Time: 19:59)\nSo, this was mainly for the toxicity, but what happens let us say I have a system which I\nthink is much better than what is currently used in clinics. And I have tested all these\ntoxicity and I found that this is good and now I want to move further and use it in\npatients.\nSo, how do I go about it, how do I get it to the patient, how do we get approvals you\ncould do with the patient, so that is what final thing we going to talk about. So, the first\nstep is of course, to make sure absolutely, that the product that you are wishing to market\nis actually feasible. So, you want to ensure that there is enough market to it, because it is\na very long and winding road as we will discuss in the next few slides. And you want to\nensure that the product after all that is going to be used and is actually going to benefit as\nwell as there is a market to it.\nThe step two is then to determine what kind of regulatory agencies such as ICMR, how\nare they going to classify it. So, whether it is going to be classified as something that is\neaten whether, this kind of like classified as a medical device. So, all of these will have a\ndifferent sort of safety and effectiveness standard, it is going to be whether just use\nexternally to the patients or whether this is going to go inside the patient, all of these will\npresent different regulatory challenges.\nAnd then the step three is the development of the data and information that you would\nneed to submit it for a marketing application. To get clearances there are certain forms\nand certain processes that you need to go through and then you will have to go ahead and\naccumulate all that and then submit it to the regulatory agency and get the approval.\n(Refer Slide Time: 21:55)\nSo, again this is a long bumpy road, the first thing you want to figure out is whether a\ndrug is druggable and what that means, is all of these properties are actually being tested\nout. You want to make sure it is specific, the toxicity of it, what is the toxicity if any and\nthe solubility how you are going to deliver it.\nSo, that includes the lipophilicity, how much you need, how it is becoming bio available,\nhow is going to transport to different regions in the body, how it is going to get absorbed.\nAnd then again how it reacts with different tissues, are there synthetic routes to make it,\nis it crossing blood brain barrier. And a several more I mean this is just some examples I\nhave listed here, but all of this needs to be checked out as you go.\n(Refer Slide Time: 22:45)\nSo, in the context of the big picture, you are looking at some kind of a biomedical\nengineering design centred around a medical need. But then you also have to consider\nregulatory concerns as well as some of the physical principles that is going to define that.\nSo, there are regulations defined by FDA, ICMR various agencies and then there are\nseveral codes and standards, that are established by professionals that you will have to\nget the approvals through.\n(Refer Slide Time: 23:17)\nSo, I will go again over the overall process for approval. So, if there is a new drug you\nrequire a full and comprehensive evaluation and there are approvals that is required at\neach step. So, if you are doing in a small animal trial you need an approval form as\nanimal ethics committee to let you first of all test it on animals. If you are doing a large\nanimal trials, you will need a large animal ethics committee, primate has a separate\ncommittee altogether. So, if you are doing trials on primate you will need those\napprovals.\nThen if everything looks good before you go further you have to do an extensive toxicity\nscreening to make sure it is not going to affect anything else. And then you finally, need\nhuman and follow up clinical trials and then we will need a human ethics committee\napproval. Just a quick note here if you are using a repurposed drug, let us say there is a\ndrug that is already being used for cancer treatment and then your study shows that this\ndrug may also be good for diabetes, then the approval is much easier because a lot of\nthese toxicity screening have been done.\nSo, for example, a lot of polymers have been approved, so you do not have to\nindividually test them, but you still will have to test them along with your drug of\ninterest. So, and in general you will have to show in these cases substantial equivalence\nto a similar composition and to be able to get that drug to approve. So, it is a much easier\npathway essentially if you are doing a repurposing of a drug.\n(Refer Slide Time: 24:53)\nAnd then in human trials also there are the several investigation phases. So, what we\nmight have heard very commonly, is called phase one clinical trial and that is to assess\nthe product safety in humans. So, again clinical trials are divided into different phases\nand the phase 1 is usually a small number to assess product safety.\nSo, it is generally localized to one or two centres, so maybe you tie up with one of the\nhospitals in the surrounding or maybe it is coming out from the hospital itself. And they\nwill get proper approvals and maybe recruit 10 to 20 patients and just see, the injection\nof this whether it is feasible or not.\nThen there is a phase 2, trial which is slightly bigger than the phase 1, which is to do a\nproper safe dosing to figure out how much dose you can give. And also look at potential\nefficacy not very deeply into the efficacy, but mostly to see the safety and the dosing of\nthat. And then there is a phase 3, this is a pivotal study, this is a well controlled clinical\ntrial that will support the safety and efficacy, this could lead to an FDA approval or any\nother similar regulatory agency depending on the country.\nAnd it is usually a multicentre involvement there are several centres there are involved\ninstead of being one or two centres you may need to do it throughout the country to show\nthat it actually first of all works in different settings as well as you may have differences\nin types of ethnics of the people that are coming in.\nSome may be slightly different in certain regions of a certain country and the people may\nbe different from the rest of the regions. So, you may want to instead of giving overall\napproval by testing only on the one set of the people you want this tested on how will\nsatisfy people that is why the multi centre involvement is required in such cases.\n(Refer Slide Time: 26:57)\nSo, having done all that and again this whole process takes quite a bit of time depending\non the disease and the extensivity to it, this could take anywhere between few years to 5,\n6, 7, 8 years for the all the human face trial to get completed. Not to mention the amount\nof time that you would have first put in to take a drug, test it in vitro, test it then in\nanimals and only then go to humans.\nSo, we are talking about almost a decade time frame to get all this data. And then let us\nsay even if that all is done then we have a GMP quality system regulations, and these are\ngood manufacturing practices regulations. So, you want to ensure that if anything is\nbeing put into humans these have been synthesized using some good manufacturing\npractices, it is sterile, it is not contaminated, so all of those factors then also come into\nplay.\nSo, these regulations require that domestic or the foreign manufacturer have some quality\nsystem for the design. It is not like you can make that anywhere, you need to make that\nin a certain contained environment and making sure that it is properly manufactured, it is\nproperly packaged, it is very properly labelled.\nAgain very important and quite a lot of debate these days. it is stored properly you have a\nsystem in place to install it and use it for different kind of clinical trials. And anything\nthat is going to be used in human will need to follow these guidelines. So, even for the\nphase trials the phase 1, phase 2, phase 3 all of this first needs to be established before\nyou can go to those trials.\n(Refer Slide Time: 28:41)\nAnd then there are as I said the regulatory challenges, so you will have to get approval\ndepending on, so this is more India specific this will depend on how much, what kind of\nproduct it is and how the regulatory agencies classifying this. So, you will have to get\ncertificates from these agencies, so, Ayush is nothing, but a department of the Ayurveda,\nyoga, naturopathy, Unani homeopathy. If your product lies in this category you will have\nto get approval from them.\nSimilarly, there are various standards such as ISO 9001 and ISO 13485 and so these are\nboth quality management systems, and defined for various types of things. So, this could\nbe a medical device or this could be something else and they are here to sort of make\nsure that you are consistently providing products and services that meet these regulatory\nrequirements. So, these agencies are going to check to see if you are satisfying a certain\ncriteria and only will then certify you. And eventual goal is to enhance the customer\nsatisfaction as well as safety.\n(Refer Slide Time: 29:43)\nSo, this is all I had to talk about in the course, I just going to give you a quick overview\nof what we do. So, I am Rachit and here is my email ID and twitter handle, if you guys\never want to follow me. Feel free to contact me as required, our lab does quite a lot of\nbiomaterial work.
