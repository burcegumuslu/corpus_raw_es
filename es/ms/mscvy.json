Tomar una decisi\u00f3n informada sobre la vacunaci\u00f3n de nuestros ni\u00f1os es fundamental para proteger su salud. Aqu\u00ed hay 5 razones clave por las que elegimos vacunar a nuestros ni\u00f1os.\n- De hecho, las vacunas mantienen saludables a nuestros ni\u00f1os. Las enfermedades que se pueden prevenir con vacunas pueden ser muy peligrosas y algunas pueden tener efectos graves de por vida o incluso causar la muerte. Nunca sabemos d\u00f3nde y cu\u00e1ndo nuestros hijos estar\u00e1n expuestos a enfermedades. Los viajes y el comercio internacionales hacen que la propagaci\u00f3n de enfermedades de un pa\u00eds a otro sea tan f\u00e1cil como abordar un avi\u00f3n.\n- La inmunizaci\u00f3n da como resultado menos ni\u00f1os que pueden infectarse con enfermedades y transmitirlas a los miembros vulnerables de nuestra comunidad, incluidos ni\u00f1os y adultos inmunocomprometidos (por ejemplo, en tratamiento contra el c\u00e1ncer o la leucemia) y que no pueden recibir vacunas, beb\u00e9s que son demasiado peque\u00f1os para recibir vacunas, embarazadas mujeres y ancianos.\n- Los expertos han estudiado los riesgos a corto y largo plazo de las vacunas, as\u00ed como los beneficios de las vacunas y est\u00e1n de acuerdo en que las vacunas son seguras y son la mejor opci\u00f3n para la salud de nuestros ni\u00f1os.\n- A trav\u00e9s de la inmunizaci\u00f3n, seguiremos viendo la eliminaci\u00f3n de enfermedades que han tenido un grave impacto en las personas de todo el mundo. Sin embargo, si dejamos de inmunizar contra enfermedades que son raras en los Estados Unidos, seguramente veremos un regreso de estas enfermedades. Un ejemplo de ello es la poliomielitis, que todav\u00eda est\u00e1 presente en partes del mundo que est\u00e1n a solo un viaje en avi\u00f3n de distancia.\n- Inmunizamos a nuestros ni\u00f1os para proteger a nuestras futuras generaciones. Si seguimos inmunizando ahora, los padres en el futuro podr\u00e1n confiar en que enfermedades como la poliomielitis y la meningitis no infectar\u00e1n, paralizar\u00e1n ni matar\u00e1n a los ni\u00f1os. Las vacunas son una de las mejores formas de poner fin a los graves efectos de las enfermedades prevenibles.\n[Coalici\u00f3n de Acci\u00f3n para la Inmunizaci\u00f3n (IAC)](https://www.immunize.org/)\n-\nMission Statement\nThe Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) works to increase immunization rates and prevent disease by creating and distributing educational materials for health professionals and the public that enhance the delivery of safe and effective immunization services. The Coalition also facilitates communication about the safety, efficacy, and use of vaccines within the broad immunization community of patients, parents, health care organizations, and government health agencies.\nDurante m\u00e1s de una d\u00e9cada, los Centros para el Control y la Prevenci\u00f3n de Enfermedades (CDC, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s) han trabajado en conjunto con IAC y le han brindado apoyo financiero con el fin de educar a los profesionales de la salud sobre las recomendaciones de vacunas de EE. UU.\nLos m\u00e9dicos, enfermeras y otros profesionales de la salud en todos los niveles de la comunidad de inmunizaci\u00f3n, incluidos los sectores p\u00fablico y privado, conf\u00edan en muchos de los siguientes proyectos en su trabajo diario para aumentar las tasas de inmunizaci\u00f3n a lo largo de la vida.\n[Video de la Semana de IAC](https://www.immunize.org/votw/) \u2013 videos archivados que destacan la informaci\u00f3n actual sobre las vacunas. [Reportes de Personas Desprotegidas](https://www.immunize.org/reports/) \u2013 relatos de la vida real de personas que sufrieron o murieron a causa de enfermedades prevenibles por vacunaci\u00f3n:
