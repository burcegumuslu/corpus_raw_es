I often feel that you understand what drives my research better  than I do. \nThanks for being with this project intensively when it has been humming along and for \nwelcoming me back into the fold every time I drifted off into one side project or crisis of \nmotivation or another. Thanks especially for all the times you ass ured the various \nuniversity review committees that wonderfully insightful writing was bound to spring \nforth from my pen any day now. I hope you feel satisfied and a little bit vindicated in seeing \nthis work come together as a coherent whole.  \nThis project would never have got off the ground without the support and direction of the \npresidents of the two Shuar federations with a presence in Zamora -Chinchipe. Thanks too \nto all the Shuar people who spoke on my behalf at \u2018Centro\u2019 and \u2018Asociaci\u00f3n\u2019 meetings, to \nthose who shared their stories of sickness and healing with me, and most of all to those \nwho welcomed me into their homes and treated me as family. When I arrived in Shuar \ncountry, I was entirely unaware of the fraught connotations of association with a whit e \nman. Contemplating it now, I am astounded and overwhelmed by the dauntlessness and \nfaith in humanity these individuals demonstrated in their willingness to trust and help me. \nEven so, with a mind to the risk they took, I will avoid thanking any of them b y name and \nleave the rest of that story for another time.  \nOn that note, thanks also to my former partner Tiffany. It must have been hard for anyone \nin Ecuador to think the worst of me when I was accompanied by someone as gracious and 4 \n beautiful as yourself . Thanks also to Andr\u00e9s for your coffee, for Salinas and for the \nconstant good vibes; and to Austin, Aliya, Roberto and Vanessa for unknowingly keeping \nme on my feet.  \nBig thanks to Claude and Chloe. I\u2019m not sure what I did to deserve such selfless friends.  \nThanks also to Sebastian Grant for your incredible artistry (see Figure 1) and to all the \nfriends who are still willing to take me back now that this incredibly time -consuming \ndocument has been brought to the finish.  \nThanks particularly to Mum & Dad, for  always standing for doing the work that you love, \nand to Carolyn, Jane and Michael for your support and your wise words when you stepped \nin back in 2009. To Sophie, Hamish and Mitchell: thanks for always being around and \nhaving something completely unrela ted to anthropology on your mind to talk about.  \nLastly, thanks to Viv, Vin, Boy & Kat, Liz & Nat, Pettit, Ibu, Charlie\u2019s Angels and everyone \nelse at the Metro Theatre and all the other crazies slaving hard at bars and caf\u00e9s to make \nspace for your music, p ainting, acting and merry -making. Keep Sydney open and keep \ndreaming big.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 5 \n ABSTRACT  \n \nWhat do we understand by the principle of state interculturality? What would be the full \nimplications of making Latin American states culturally representative, rath er than agents \nof modernisation on the European model? Could the state reflect the distinctive local \ncultures within the various particular regions of its sovereign territory? This project takes \nthe example of state healthcare in Ecuador, an \u2018intercultural  state\u2019 according to its 2008 \nconstitution, as a point of entry to answering these questions.  \nBy presenting an epistemological critique of biomedicine as culturally specific and \nhistorically contingent, it argues for intercultural health as a break with t aking western \nknowledge systems as the universal arbiters for social policy. Instead, it proposes that the \nhealth -seeking preferences of indigenous minority groups \u2013working with the example of \nthe Shuar nationality in the south -eastern Amazonian province of  Zamora -Chinchipe \u2013\nbecome the basis for culturally representative state healthcare within their territory. I \nargue that this is a question of indigenous justice, in light of the evident dramatic \ndisconnects in meaning and disappointed expectations of many S huar people in their \nengagement with clinical healthcare. However for non -indigenous society, too, \nintercultural health would lead to the further development of health practices founded on \ndistinct epistemological and ontological assumptions from those of western biomedicine, \nthereby bringing a new diversity of approaches with which intercultural societies could \naddress universal social problems.   \nYet the effort to put forward a medical ethnographic representation of Shuar culture \nunderstood as a set of pr esent -day practices and preferences, rather than a body of 6 \n essentialised tradition, raises the question of how meaningful it is today to speak of \ncultural groups, when these are inevitably cross -cut by transnational economic, religious \nand political -discur sive forces to different extents in different locations. The thesis thus \nconcludes with a suggestion for what we mean when we say we value cultural diversity.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7 \n TABLE OF CONTENTS  \n \nChapter 1: \u2018El Ecuador es un Estado [\u2026] intercultural\u2019                                                                     14 \nInterculturality, the Geopolitics of Knowledge and Decolonisation                                              18  \nThe Politics of  Epistemology in Traditional Medicine                                                                         35  \nBioprospecting and the Encounter between Knowledge Systems                                               39  \nShuar Healing and Traditional Medi cine Debates                                                                               44  \nDe Facto Interculturality in the Borderlands of the Ecuadorian State                                               49 \n \nChapter 2: Why Interculturalise?

intercultural\u2019  \n \nEcuador\u2019s Constitution of Montecristi, drafted by left -wing parties and indigenous, \ncampesino1 and Afro -Ecuadorian representatives, defined the Ecuadorian state as \n\u2018intercultural\u2019 and also \u2018plurinational\u2019 in 2008. Interculturality ha s been a long -standing \ndemand of indigenous movements as a corrective to the colonial heritage of the Latin \nAmerican republics, which have been built on the model of European states at the expense \nof the intellectual and organisational heritage of the cont inent\u2019s first peoples. It asks the \nquestion: what would the state look like if its institutions were designed to be \nrepresentative of each of the multitude of cultures within its borders, rather than being \norganised around exclusively European conceptualis ations of and procedures for \nachieving justice, education, public health, economic prosperity and democratic \nrepresentation? Of course, writing something into law does not automatically make it so, \na relevant point for even minor legislation, let alone a r edefinition of the philosophical \nfoundations of the state itself. The present research is an attempt to come to terms with \nall of the requirements and implications of putting interculturality into practice.  \nSeveral preceding works on state interculturality have focused  on the critique of putatively \nintercultural programs  pushed forward by Latin American states . Research on intercultural \neducation has pointed out that such initiatives may be  more oriented toward  elite -driven \npolicy considerat ions than to the needs of indigenous people ( Llanes  Ortiz, 200 8: 55-60), \nor may not go beyond an essentialist focus on  indigenous language and folklore, ignoring \n                                                        \n1 Usually translated as \u2018peasant\u2019 or \u2018rural poor\u2019, it is a category that includes landless rural labourers as well \nas smallholders.  15 \n \u2018the implicit philosophies that they express\u2019 (Tubino, 2005: 93). On intercultural health, \nresearchers have expressed concerns  with  \u2018ethnobureaucratic\u2019 and \n\u2018ethnodevelopmentalist \u2019 policies that , they argue, serve to depoliticise indigenous \ncampaigns for autonomy by regulating certain indigenous health practitioners who \ncooperate with state inter cultural programs while criminalising those who do not (Bolados \nGarc\u00eda, 2011 ). From this perspective, state initiatives at intercultural health appear as a \npositive step, but in practice may function as mechanisms for co -opting and sanitising \ncultural difference  (Boccara, 2015). Common to these critiques is the argument that state -\nled interculturality represents a form of  \u2018neoindigenismo \u20192 (Boccara & Bolados  Garc\u00eda , \n2008) , in the sense of adopting tokenistic elements of indigenous culture as cover for t he \ndevelop ment  of indigenous territories according to the priorities of state and capitalist \nactors rather than indigenous people s themselves .  \nWithout detract ing from the importance of these studies, the present research takes a \ndifferent approach , more  oriented toward providing practica l policy suggestions in a way \nthat is  informed by the hopeful political processes underway in Ecuador, Venezuela and \nBolivia , where there have been openings to intercultural health policies that empower \nindigenous people s (Calder\u00f3n, 2010 : 54-58; Freire, 2015 : 70ff. ). Indeed, it is an ethnography \nof Yanomami interactions with the Venezuelan state\u2019s attempts to extend free healthcare \nservices within its Amazonian territory (Kelly, 2011) that constitutes the clearest precedent  \nand parallel to the present research. Rather than critiquing existing state initiatives \nautodenominated as \u2018intercultural\u2019, this research aims to develop an extended case study \n                                                        \n2 \u2018Indigen ismo\u2019 summarises an approach to state policies toward indigenous peoples that simultaneously \ncelebrated and exoticised indigenous culture and equated it with the past (see Alonso, 2004: 475; Knight, \n1990).  16 \n pursuing the question of how the state competency of healthcare could be reconsidered, \nreformulated and put into practice by an intercultural state in the territory of a particular \ncultural group \u2013the Shuar people of the Ecuadorian -Amazonian province of Zamora -\nChinchipe. In this sense, this rese arch is a piece of applied political philosophy, for it has \nbeen carried out as if there were the political will to immediately begin drawing up a \nblueprint for implementing the revolutionary ideals of the 2008 Constitution.3 I contend \nthat this research p rocess has allowed for new insights into the potential of and the \nobstacles to state interculturality, and indeed the way in which culture itself is currently \nunderstood. The research also provides raw material for future campaigns and policies to \nintercul turalise and decolonise the state in Ecuador and elsewhere in Latin America and \nthe world.  \nWith healthcare as its case study , the present project is also a piece of medical \nanth ropological research. A sophisticated picture of the cultural context in question is \nessential for the analysis of the extent of the potential differences in the ways cultures \nconceptualise and strive for health, the terrain on which these differences are most \nmarked and their ramifications for intercultural state institutions. Importantly, this medical \nanthropological analysis is as necessary for biomedical science as it is for the practices of \nthe Shuar of Zamora -Chinchipe, or whichever other group may st ruggle to see its culture \nrepresented and supported by the state under whose dominion they live. It is essential to \ninterculturality to avoid the privileging of any one culturally specific worldview. As such, \nneither biomedical science nor any other knowle dge system can be elevated as the arbiter \nof truth and falsehood within its specified domain of social life. By drawing on secondary \n                                                        \n3 In public statements, at least, Ecuadorian offic ials have claimed there is \u2018enormous political will\u2019 to make \nthe public health system intercultural (e.g. Calder\u00f3n, 2010: 54).  17 \n sources as well as presenting my own analysis, Chapter 2 makes a comprehensive case for \nseeing biomedical science as one pa rticular (albeit currently hegemonic) \u2018situated\u2019 \nknowledge system, whose pretensions to universality are undermined by the socio -\nhistorical contingencies of its development.  \nOne might ask why settler -colonial and multicultural societies should make such a  \ncommitment to interculturality. Are presently existing states not already supposed to be \nimplementing policies according to the most cutting -edge, rational and objective scientific \nand social -scientific research in the respective fields? A progressively m inded citizen might \nwell support indigenous self -determination in areas where indigenous people form a \nmajority demographic presence, but at the same time remain skeptical of the suitability of \nreconsidering the operative principles of the state outside of  indigenous territories. For \nthis reason, I will argue continuously throughout this thesis that interculturality is not just \na matter of justice for indigenous peoples. It is also a utilitarian question for non -\nindigenous society, because it illustrates th e ways in which cultural and epistemic \ndifference points us to new ways to solve our current problems.  \nBefore moving to introduce the manner in which the cultural and epistemic difference that \nis concretised by Shuar people in their health -seeking practic es will be made visible in this \nstudy, there are two particularly relevant fields of social -science literature whose insights \nand flaws need to be brought into consideration. One is that of international public health, \na field which, although certainly ove rlapping with medical anthropology, takes a greater \nrole than the latter in formulating proposals for the incorporation of traditional and \nindigenous medical knowledge and practice into the policies of nation -states and \ninternational institutions. Critical ly analysing the blind spots in this field illustrates the ways 18 \n in which the field\u2019s goals of making the best use of all the medical knowledge and \nresources at a society\u2019s disposal can be better accomplished by taking interculturality as \nthe analytical poi nt of departure.  \nBefore doing so, however, it is necessary to contextualise my use of interculturality and \nthe intercultural in t he light of preceding work.  The use of interculturality in this thesis \nfollows  those intellectuals concerned with the relationship between modernity and \ncoloniality and with indigenous decolonial campaigns  in Latin America  (especially Kowii \nMaldonado, 2011 a; Mignolo, 2005b; Tubino, 2005: 84; Walsh, 2009 ). These authors\u2019 \nemphasis on the geopolitics of knowledge and the imperative of decolonising \nepistemology have fundamentally informed a key element of the structure of this \nresearch : its efforts  in Chapter 2  to deconstruct the universalising pretensions of \nbiomedical epistemology through a historicist and materialist interpretation  of its \ndevelopment as a knowledge system. I also set these thinkers in dialogue with outside \ncritiques of the conceptualisation o f culture implied by multiculturalism (Descola, 2013a, \n2013b; Rosaldo, 1993;  Santos, Meneses  & Nunes , 2007 ; \u017di\u017eek, 1997) . Ultimately, however, \nthe meaning of culture is continually developed throughout this thesis in conversation \nwith the  complex and unexpected  results of the ethnographic research as it is presented.  \n \nInterculturality, the Geopolitics of Knowledge and Decolonisation  \nSince the passing of the dominance of explicitly assimilationist policies toward indigenous \npeoples by the 1980s and 90s, interculturality emerged as a highly plastic term moulded \naccording to different actors\u2019 preferences for redressing indigenous disempowerment; or, \nfrom the perspective of powerful sectors, redressing \u2018the indigenous question\u2019. In spite of 19 \n this debate, for now I will initially write in the hortative mode in order to explain my hopes \nand intentions in taking up interculturality as a frame for this study. Interculturality belongs \nto what Ramiro \u00c1vila Santamar\u00eda has called \u2018the Andean utopian hor izon\u2019 (cited in Acosta, \n2013): it is a model for relations between peoples and cultures that seeks to rectify the \ncolonial legacy in the social and political institutions of Latin America. In Ecuador, \nindigenous peoples continued to be economically exploit ed, politically repressed and \ndenied civic rights well into the second half of the twentieth century. Having won their \nhuman rights in struggles from 1964 \u20131998, Ecuadorian indigenous peoples had to then \nface the challenge of the colour -blind politics of li beral citizenship. Consider the \nperspective of Ariruma Kowii Maldonado \u2013writer, poet and Ecuadorian indigenous leader \nof Kichwa nationality \u2013who argues that the denial of indigenous culture is still causing  \nthe formulation of excluding and exploitative policies, and of the planning of projects and the \ndefinition of budgets that do not consider the particularities of the [indigenous] peoples and \nnationalities in their various enclaves within the national territory. These policies are designed \nfrom a singu lar reality, focused in and concentrated on abstractions like \u2018the development of \nthe country\u2019 or \u2018the national culture\u2019 (2011a: 21).4  \nThe challenge here is to re -evaluate the desirability of basic tenets of western political \nphilosophy, such as developme nt, as well as whatever culturally peculiar assumptions we \nmay find within the sub -spheres of states, such as public health institutions. According to \nKowii Maldonado, it is necessary \u2018to define public policies that are thought out from \ndiversity\u2019 so as to  \u2018democratise public space\u2019 and allow indigenous peoples to regain \n\u2018confidence in their identity [and] pride in their language\u2019 (2011a: 29). This was the principle \n                                                        \n4 Translations from Spanish texts are my own.  20 \n behind the inclusion of the Kichwa term \u2018sumak kawsay\u20195\u2013generally translated as \u2018good \nliving \u2019 or \u2018right living\u2019 (Macas, 2010; Tortosa, 2011) \u2013as an objective of the Ecuadorian state \nin the 2008 Constitution. Although one might suggest that Kowii Maldonado\u2019s principal \nmotivation is justice for indigenous peoples, his position can be supported by mo re \ngeneral, utilitarian argumentation. One must recognise that reforms aimed at goals like \n\u2018confidence in one\u2019s identity\u2019 (\u2018seguridad identitaria\u2019) are not feel -good measures with \nsignificance only at the level of individual psychology. Distinct cultures\u2019 approaches to \nunderstanding and acting in/on/with the world yield very concrete differences in outcomes \nwith origins in their particular ontologies, epistemologies and histories. As such, the \nepistemic pluralism implied by interculturality has the potentia l to open up the conditions \nfor dialogue between and the mutual enrichment of knowledge systems, a project that \npromises to be especially fruitful when applied to medicine and healthcare.   \nThe key challenge for interculturality \u2013and also cultural anthropol ogy (Descola, 2013a: 30) \u2013\nis to ensure that it is not contained by a culturally specific understanding of the concept of \nculture itself. \u2018Culture\u2019 in this sense does not refer to all that is traditional and historic \n(Garc\u00eda Canclini, 1992). In the sense of referring to the definitive characteristics of given \ngroups of people with a shared historical experience, the culture of a people includes all \nof the ways that they conceptualise, relate to, make sense of and act upon the various \nelements of their environ ment. In the contemporary sense, however, of culture in the vein \nof liberal multiculturalism or cultural diversity, cultures are typically understood as \nsomewhat anachronistic ways of thinking and acting from a minority position which are \n                                                        \n5 According to Luis Maldonado Ruiz (2010: 85), \u2018sumak\u2019 can signify grandeur, plenty, excellence, \nmagnificence and beauty; \u2018kawsay\u2019 can mean life, existence, conduct and sustenance. Ariruma Kowii \nMaldonado says that \u2018kawsay\u2019 refers to \u2018all that which contrib utes to the continuity and flowering of \nexistence and creativity\u2019 (2011a: 26).  21 \n recognised (and e ven celebrated) so long as their impact on dominant discourses is nil \n(Santos, Meneses & Nunes, 2007: xxi \u2013xxv). Alternatively, as Slavoj \u017di\u017eek puts it:  \nMulticulturalism is a racism which empties its own position of all positive content (the \nmulticulturali st is not a direct racist, he doesn\u2019t oppose to the Other the particular values of \nhis own culture), but nonetheless retains this position as the privileged empty point of \nuniversality from which one is able to appreciate (and depreciate) properly other pa rticular \ncultures \u2014the multiculturalist respect for the Other\u2019s specificity is the very form of asserting \none\u2019s own superiority (1997: 44).  \nThe sleight of hand lies in the classification of western, and particularly Anglophone, \nsociety as free from cultural  bias (Rosaldo, 1993: 198), at least to the degree that \nconservative, religious and nationalistic tendencies can be kept down by the liberal \nintellectual hegemony. The portrayal, by way of contrast, of \u2018others\u2019 \u2013the most obvious \ncurrent example being Muslim  Arabs \u2013as enslaved by their own culture serves to legitimise \nthe dominance of western culture (Kundnani, 2014), which of course is not framed as \n\u2018cultural\u2019 but as knowledge about reality. The way in which \u2018the cultural\u2019 constitutes a \ncategorisation with re spect to the history of colonialism, subjugation and marginalisation \nmirrors \u017di\u017eek\u2019s observation about ideology: just as we locate ideology not in ourselves but \nin the \u2018false\u2019 ideology of others (1994: 6), similarly we only see culture in the conceptual \nflaws and limitations in the thought and worldview of others, while believing ourselves to \nbe \u2018postcultural\u2019 (Rosaldo, 1993: 199 -200).  \nPursuing this vexing portrayal of \u2018the cultural\u2019 in hegemonic discourse into current debates \nin international public health  on the role of traditional medicine, the dismissive posture \ntoward traditional medicine reinforces the need for interculturality and a reframing of the \nnotion of culture. Calls to recognise and make use of the knowledge and resources of 22 \n traditional medici ne date back prominently to the Alma -Ata Declaration of 1978 and, more \nrecently, the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) Traditional Medicine Strategy (2002). \nGiven that some three -quarters of the world\u2019s population rely on it as their primary source \nof trea tment, the argument goes that traditional medicine should be recognised as a \nvaluable public health resource and integrated into state healthcare bodies. This proposal \ncould be said to complement the observation of the immense cost of making first -world \ntreatment available to the entire world\u2019s population. Indeed, for this very reason the \nproposal has been criticised from sub -Saharan Africa as legitimising jingoistic lauding of \ntraditional medical treatments for AIDS in preference to pharmaceuticals (Flint,  2011: \n88ff.).  \nSpeaking from Latin America, in contrast, there is little threat of outright rejection of \nwestern medicine and other technologies, a prospect that concerns some critics of post -\ncolonial and post -modern theory (e.g. Nanda, 2003). Indeed, Lati n America is not external \nto the West but rather is largely constituted by western societal forms, which emanate \nfrom cosmopolitan centres, extending themselves and intermingling with those of \npeoples from different traditions. This predominately western q uality to Latin American \nsociety does not prevent the pervasive perception of its \u2018underdevelopment\u2019 \u2013the notion \nthat Latin America is eternally behind the more modern, advanced and sophisticated world \ncentres of Europe and North America \u2013a perception which in the Andean -Amazonian \nregion in particular often manifests in the automatic esteem granted to all things that \noriginate in the North Atlantic world: \u2018the magic of the modern,\u2019 to redeploy the phrase \nused by Michael Taussig to explain the attraction of th e sub -standard healthcare to which \nhe bore witness in rural Colombia (1987: 274 -9). In Ecuadorian towns and cities, including \nthose in the Amazon Basin, it is common to see native medicinal plants industrialised and 23 \n packaged as herbal extracts labelled wit h \u2018Made in the USA\u2019 as a symbol of their legitimacy. \nIn short, in Latin America traditional medicine is more vulnerable to assimilation by the \nparadigm of biomedical science than it is to overwrought veneration.  \nThe more relevant point in the Latin Americ an context, then, is to consider the workings \nof the geopolitics of knowledge in discussions of traditional medicine. If, as Catherine \nWalsh argues, \u2018knowledge functions like economics: it is organised around centres of \npower and subordinate regions\u2019 (2004 : 2), then one would expect to see evidence of \nhierarchical relationships between the various products and producers of knowledge. \nAlready, there have been suggestions from the Ecuadorian state that the Ministry of Public \nHealth would need to certify inter cultural health practitioners, \u2018in order to prevent \nmalpractice and charlatanism,\u2019 a fraught suggestion depending on the epistemological \ncharacter of the \u2018processes of validation\u2019 required (Calder\u00f3n, 2010: 59). Indeed, the \ndemand for traditional and indige nous healing practices to prove themselves against the \nepistemological and ontological assumptions of other healing systems is a highly \ndeveloped tendency at the international level. The pharmaceutical industry influenced \n(Mullard, 2010), Geneva -based WHO self-designates as the arbiter of acceptable and \nunacceptable traditional medicine according to a mix of the science and culturally \nembedded norms and moral and aesthetic preferences of the North -Atlantic countries. \nLooking at the WHO\u2019s Traditional Medicin e Strategy , one hears of the \u2018urgent\u2019 task of \nevaluating, regulating and reforming traditional medicine. Subsequent objectives follow: \nthe \u2018qualification and licensing of providers; proper use of products of assured quality; \n[and] provision of scientific i nformation and guidance for the public, \u2019 given that \u2018the \nquality of herbal products sold is generally not guaranteed\u2019 (WHO, 2002: 4). The \nfundamental policy principles are \u2018promoting evidence -based use of TM/CAM [traditional 24 \n medicine/complementary and alternative medicine]\u2019 and the oft -repeated goal of \u2018rational \nuse\u2019 (WHO, 2002: 5). Yet these seemingly common -sense signifiers point to a hegemony of \none particular practice of knowledge \u2013biomedical science \u2013that is sustained over and above \nother systems. If we are unwilling to accept the mystification or exoticisation of \nindigenous healing practices, it is just as necessary to demystify the discourse, or \u2018ruling \nrelations\u2019 (Smith, 2005), that connect the institutions of biomedicine \u2013from the WHO to \npharmaceutical corporations, the US Food and Drug Authority (FDA), US and World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) patent law, universities, public health ministries and biomedical \nclinics \u2013and sustains their hegemonic position as the arbiters of tru th regarding health and \nillness. By ruling relations is meant  \n[those] relations that divorced the subject from the particularised settings and relationships \nof her life and [\u2026] created subject positions that elevated consciousness into a universalised \nmod e, whether of the social relations mediated by money or of those organised as objectivity \nin academic or professional discourse (Smith, 2005: 13).  \nBefore beginning the discussion of contemporary Shuar health -seeking practices, then, \nChapter 2 presents an analysis demonstrating how the socio -historical particularities of the \ndevelopment of biomedicine\u2019s ruling relations have epistemological consequences that \nshape the kind of medicine that can be envisaged and produced.  Drawing on institutional \nethn ography as methodological approach, this critique will maintain its grounding in \neveryday experience (Campbell & Gregor, 2002: 60), in this case that of Shuar people for \nwhom, despite the multiplicity of healing products and practices in their environment,  it is \nonly biomedicine that is considered officially legitimate and worthy of state -backed \nfinancial, technical and professional support.  25 \n The geopolitics of knowledge critique is therefore central. However it is but one part of \nthe aforementioned \u2018decolon ial\u2019 literature that forms the theoretical and conceptual basis \nfor and grows out of the work of social movements campaigning for interculturality and \nplurinationalism (D\u00e1valos, 2002 ; Grosfoguel, 2007 , 2011 ; Kowii M aldonado, 2011b ; Mignolo, \n2009 ; Walsh 2007 , 2009 ). Much  of this literature is of the indigenous movement and in \nEcuador is closely aligned with CONAIE, the Confederation of the Indigenous Nationalities \nof Ecuador (CONAIE, 2007b ; Macas, 2004 ). CONAIE has led indigenous peoples\u2019 recent \nresurgence of political protagonism in Ecuador , particularly via the marches and blockades \nthat have been carried out numerous times since the 1990s (Acosta et al., 2 001; Macas, \n1991 ). As Hugo Benavides writes, indigenous history in Ecuador \u2018has been erased, changed \nand mutilated in every way possible to alter discursive elements and present Indians in a \nnegative light\u2019 (2004: 150); thus the significance for indigenous peoples \u2018to be \nincorporated into their own debates, not as passive policy and research projects, but as \nfull historical subjects\u2019 (Benavides, 2004: 143; also Macas, 1991). The fact that it is even \nnecessary for a people to be \u2018incorporated into their own debates\u2019 speaks volumes of the \ncultural exclusivity that has inhered in understandings of \u2018history,\u2019 \u2018rationality,\u2019 \n\u2018development\u2019 and other key epistemological terms that structure social research and  \npolicy. This critique of \u2018the coloniality of knowledge\u2019 forms an essential theoretical \nbackground to the claims and objectives of the popular movements for interculturality and \nplurinationalism (especially Quijano, 2008 , 2010 ). As such, I will briefly outline the central \ntheoreti cal propositions of these writers.  \nThe definitive proposition of the decoloniality group is that the traditional western forms \nof supposedly neutral and objective knowledge are fundamentally implicated in the \nproject of colonialism. The starting point of t his thesis draws particularly on the notion that 26 \n colonisation of the Americas was the condition of possibility for modernisation in Europe: \nit provided not only the material basis \u2013the mountains of gold and silver that became the \ncapital for capitalism (Graeber, 2012: 312 )\u2013but also the possibility of an international \ncommodity trade contro lled by the colonial powers. It was this trade that required an \nabstracted body of knowledge about the innumerable details of the colonised world for \nthe managerial purposes of colonial administrators. As Mignolo argues, \u2018science became a \ncolonizing tool [ \u2026] rather than being an apparatus that contests it\u2019 (2005b: 117 ), an \nestablished point for historians of the interrelationship between Euro -American \ncolonialism and biomedicine (Anderson, 2006; Arnold, 1993; Hewa, 1995; Vaughan, 1991). \nOther notable fields  of colonial knowledge  were the development of systems of racial \nclassification (Quijano, 2000: 247 ) and the doctrines of sovereignty (and non -sovereignty) \nin international jurisprudence (Anghie, 2004: 9 -30), for these formed the epistemic basis \nfor the naturalisation of Europeans\u2019 dom ination of their fellow human beings, leaving a \nlegacy of systematic exclusion of vast sectors of Latin America\u2019s (and the world\u2019s) \npopulation from power and autonomy. The delineation of the rational and the irrational \nwas essential to maintaining a detached position of domination over these processes, \nwhich in itself concealed white patriarchy within a carefully constructed style of objective \nrationality  (see Taussig, 1987: 37) , while excluding  others as wild, savage or emotional. \nThus, modernity and coloniality are understood interchangeably as \u2018the cultural project of \nordering the world according to rational principles from the perspective of a male \nEurocentric consciousness\u2019 (Escobar, 2010: 36 -37).6    \n                                                        \n6 Coloniality was therefore constitutive of formal colonialism, but has also outlasted it.  27 \n For the modern, colonial state, social sciences can be considered \u2018constitutive\u2019; the \nforma tion of modern nation -states and the consolidation of colonialism depended on \n\u2018techno -scientific knowledge, particularly knowledge that emerges from the social \nsciences\u2019 (Castro -G\u00f3mez & Martin, 2002: 270 ). In response to the exclusion of entire \npopulations from the managerial domain of knowledge and political power clai ming \neminence over them, \u2018[t]he crucial interpellation is that of the population of the global \nSouth demanding the right to be able to live healthily and develop their own economies, \npolitics and cultures\u2019 (Dussel, 1996: 31 ). I would elaborate this by adding the right to live \nand develop according to  their own cultures. Culture  is be understood here as an entire \nframe of reference, as \u2018the all -encompassing myth [that] provides us with the horizon of \nintelligibility within which all of our ideas, convictions and acts of conscience must \nnecessarily be located if they are to captiv ate our spirit\u2019 (Panikkar, 1996 ). Consequently, \nthe coloniality critique and the desire to reformulate colonial epistemology necessitate the \nreformulation of the concept of government and the state, precisely the objectives of the \nplurinationalism movement. According to Catherine Walsh, the intentions of indigenous \nmovements in the process of constitutional reform have clearly been \u2018to demand the \ntransformation of the mono -cultural nation -state and not to simpl y add their difference to \nthe existing dominant normative matrix\u2019 (2002: 29 ). Similarly, Boaventura de Sousa Santos \nargues that \u2018a fundamental principle\u2019 of intercultural and plurinational constitutions is that \n\u2018differences require appropriate institutions [and] similarities require shared institutions\u2019 \n(2007: 24 ). He terms the refusal of this principle \u2018societal fascism,\u2019 in which large bodies of \npopulations are kept outside of any kind of social contract (2001: 186 ). In this way, the \ncritique of the politics of knowledge implicates a critique of the state and demands the \nreformulation of both.    28 \n In this, the decoloniality program seeks to distance itself from multiculturalism tied to the \nliberal vision of individual subjects under the nation -state. Such political philosophies \u2013\nthough they have come to tolerate multiculturalism as compatible with the basic l iberal \npremise of allowing the individual the maximum possible freedom that does not impinge \nupon the freedom of others (Berlin, 1969: xlvi )\u2013nonetheless tend to be jealous of their \nexclusive right of intervention in cultural contexts deemed to be violating rights, as \ndefined from their own, liberal tradition (e.g. Kymlicka, 2003: 161 -2). It is this contradiction \nthat has led contemporary liberal multiculturalism to form a sort of compromise position \nwith co nservative nationalisms \u2013a religious tendency to disregard heathens from the same \nprotection as believers \u2013and this encouraged conservatives such as former British Prime \nMinister David Cameron to adopt what he dubbed a stance of \u2018muscular liberalism\u2019 as part  \nof the so -called war on terror (BBC, 2011 ). This elitist quality of liberalism can be traced \nback to John Stuart Mill himself, for his office with the East India Company convinced him \nthat \u2018despotism  is a legitimate mode of government when dealing with barbarians\u2019 (1869 \n[1999]: 10). In this way, liberal multiculturalism can serve to maintain the political space for \naggressive nationalism expressed in terms of a defence of liberalism and the individual . \nThe recent crusade against Mexican -American Studies in secondary education in Arizona \nis paradigmatic, for the (quite accurate) charges against it were the promotion of group \nidentification in students and a philosophical basis outside of western civilis ation \n(Rodr\u00edguez, 2012a ), for which its proponents received death threats (Rodr\u00edguez, 2012b ).7 \nDespite the best intentions of communitarian liberals such as Will Kymlicka, in certain \ncontexts the liberalism espoused becomes in practic e an imperial resource for dividing and \n                                                        \n7 As Orozco argues, Arizona\u2019s Superintendent of Public Instruction criticised the Me xican American Studies \nprogram by arguing, \u2018I believe people are individuals, not exemplars of racial groups,\u2019 yet also used the \nword American \u2018as a synonym for White\u2019 (2012: 51 -52). 29 \n conquering (see e.g. Blackwell, 2012; Lazar, 2004; Weber, 2005). In the Ecuadorian \nAmazon, oil multinationals have historically made use of the language of liberal rights, \nparticularly individual land title and refus al of the jurisdiction of community organisations. \nThey thereby bypassed community opposition to oil extraction by bribing those who live \nin the immediate vicinity of oil wells, recognising only individual title rather than communal \njurisdiction and foundi ng their own well funded \u2018community\u2019 organisations to represent \nminorities of the people (Sawyer, 2004: 6, 67, 200 ). In this case, liberalism has diluted \nlocally articulated expressions of democracy and co -opted indigenous sovereignty to a \nculturally unrepresentat ive national level of politics. Such instances provoke the demands \nof state interculturality and plurinationalism.    \nIn Latin America, \u2018interculturality\u2019 has, however, often been used as a substitute for liberal \nmulticulturalism in the sense just describe d. In the case of education, indigenous culture \nends up being identified with pre -Columbian practices which, though valued instead of \ndeprecated, are considered as part of the past and largely irrelevant to the indigenous \npeoples in the present day. In oth er words, interculturality becomes a token gesture of \nacknowledgement rather than a fundamental reconsideration of institutional and \nepistemic assumptions. Charles Hale argues that this is the essential nature of \n\u2018neoliberalism\u2019s cultural project [\u2026] pro -active recognition of a minimal package of \ncultural rights, and an equally vigorous rejection of the rest\u2019 (2002: 485 ). In his research in \nGuat emala, he argues that interculturality came to mean \u2018cultural sensitivity, with no real \nconcessions that would lead to Maya empowerment\u2019 (2002: 520). The essential response \nis to understand culture as going far beyond the superficial differences that it ma nifests, \nthinking instead of culture as \u2018the all -encompassing myth\u2019 providing us with our \u2018horizon \nof intelligibility.\u2019 Such a definition parallels Roy Wagner\u2019s proposal to understand culture 30 \n as \u2018a total system of conceptualisation\u2019 (1981: 142), thereby em bracing both ontology and \nepistemology. When it comes to intercultural health, all healing practices should be \nunderstood as manifestations of the ontological precepts of the culture to which they \nbelong.  \nIt is important to note that as a research program,  decoloniality is not concerned purely \nwith Latin America, but in fact often directs its attention toward European colonial centres, \nconnecting socio -historical analysis with epistemological critique (Escobar, 1995; Santiago -\nValles, 2003 ). In this sense, it is partly a reversal of the much criticised area studies model \nof fixing the object of social research and producing knowledge about it for consumption \nat a centre of knowledge, particularly the United States and other North -Atlantic \ncountries. Instead, the program seeks to examine \u2018hegemonic articulations of power\u2019 and \nthereby produce knowledge about them for liberatory purposes (Ayora Diaz, 2007 ; Mato, \n2000 ). This school of thought is thereby closely linked with anthropology\u2019s recent mission \nto evaluate  its historical implication in colonialism \u2013studying the savage \u2013and propose \nalternative, \u2018post -colonial\u2019 paths of research, one of which is the inversion of the \nanthropological gaze back onto the West (Rabinow, 1986: 241 ), also referred to as \n\u2018symmetrical anthropology\u2019 (Latour, 2010: 49 ) and closely tied to Chakrabarty\u2019s project to \n\u2018provincialize Europe\u2019 (2000). In its efforts to pluralise hegemonic (Eurocentric ) \nknowledge and unitary conceptions of social truth, the decoloniality group shares \nsimilarities with feminist standpoint theorists (Harding, 1987 ) and advocates of situated \nknowledges (Haraway, 1988 ).  \nCurrently, the Ecuadorian public health system operates almost entirely on the basis of the \nknowledge and the epistemological and ontological assumptions of the North -Atlantic 31 \n world. This fact should be understood in light of the preceding critique of coloniality, the \ngeopolitics of knowledge and their ruling relations. As critics of epistemic injustice have \npointed out, \u2018inequitable social relations inflect what counts a s knowledge and who is \nrecognised as a credible knower\u2019 (Wylie, 2011: 233). Throughout the history of the \nEcuadorian state it is only biomedicine that has been considered worthy of official support, \nsuch that its pre -eminence in the country is the artifice  of an unjust history, rather than the \noutcome of linear progress toward ever more accurate knowledge. Since being \ndesignated an intercultural state in 2008, and in fact ever since the short -lived Department \nof Indigenous Health was established in 2001, sm all steps toward interculturality in state \nhealthcare have been taken. However, the process has been met with resistance at the \nlevel of institutional culture in a manner that reflects colonial divisions in Ecuadorian \nsociety. As a Shuar community leader, nurse and Coordinator of the Department in \nZamora -Chinchipe described it to me:  \nWhen they created the Departments of Indigenous Health in 2001, for me, sincerely, it was \ngood news, to have heard that they created a national -level department for the health  of the \nindigenous peoples of Ecuador. So I went to work with so much enthusiasm and so much \nhope, thinking that this was a great opportunity, but I found myself in more of the same. At \nthe moment that I began to live in somebody else\u2019s house, they didn\u2019t allow us to develop our \nown way of looking at life, our own way of wanting to make health. [\u2026] At the moment of \narriving at the house, you might say, that was administered by mestizo8 people, it was so \ndifficult: for them, they thought, \u2018You people, how is  it that you\u2019re inside my house?\u2019 So we \nsaid, \u2018We don\u2019t have recognition.\u2019 At the national level, there were no laws or policies set out \n                                                        \n8 The term refers to Latino people of mixed European and indigenous ances try. A majority of Ecuadorians \nidentify as mestizo.  32 \n for the creation of these departments. It was simply done by decree. So there were many \ncomplications.  \nThis resistance is perhaps the reason why current intercultural health initiatives in Ecuador, \nwhile certainly beneficial, are also somewhat tokenistic. One example is the Intercultural \nHealth System (\u2018Sistema de Salud Intercultural\u2019) in the majority Kichwa Amazonian \n\u2018can t\u00f3n\u2019 Loreto (Orellana province), an initiative highlighted as a success by the Director \nof the Ministry of Health\u2019s \u2018Direcci\u00f3n de Salud Intercultural\u2019 (Calder\u00f3n, 2010: 58). \nResearchers carrying out a case study there praised the \u2018Casa Intercultural del Par to\u2019 \n(Intercultural Birth Centre) for a 60 percent increase in medically attended births (Arteaga, \nSan Sebasti\u00e1n & Amores, 2012: 405). However, they also described minimal engagement \nwith local community fora on the part of medical personnel \u2013or even awarene ss of the \nindigenous healing practitioners working in their vicinity (2012: 408 -9)\u2013 and argued that \n\u2018the protocols for putting the intercultural focus into practice were limited to vertical \nbirthing, such that interculturality had been reduced to vertical births\u2019 (2012: 411). A danger \nof tokenism in intercultural health, too, is that initiatives flatten out the diversity between \nindigenous groups, which in the Ecuadorian context means that they tend to represent \nKichwa ontological and epistemological assump tions at the expense of those of Shuar \npeople (see Chapter 7, Section 3) and other indigenous groups.  \nThough there is clearly some support for intercultural health initiatives on the part of the \nEcuadorian state, the process of their implementation and fu nding has been piecemeal \nthroughout the national territory. The fact that intercultural health projects have \nadvanced furthest in Chimborazo and Imbabura (Calder\u00f3n, 2010: 58; Mignone et. al., 2007: \n5), provinces with both an extensive indigenous demographi c presence and long histories 33 \n of indigenous political organisation, suggests that the support of influential local political \nfigures and organisations is important if any traction is to be achieved in actualising the \nstate\u2019s principles in the area of inter cultural health. The proliferation of indigenous \norganisations claiming to represent each ethnically defined group, as well as the sheer \nnumber of nation -building projects being taken on by various agencies of the Ecuadorian \nstate, pose s challenges for the  effective actualisation of the state\u2019s socialist and \nintercultural principles. In effect, it demands competition between indigenous actors to \nengage with state actors in a manner reminiscent of the role of lobbyists or NGOs in other \nsocieties. In exchange  for compromises with the state, these organisations gain a status \nfurther elevated toward their goal of being acknowledged as the legitimate \nrepresentatives of their particular group.  In this sense, the current relationship between \nthe Ecuadorian state an d indigenous organisations shows characteristics reflecting a \ncombination of the historical trajectory of corporativism ,9 in its clientelistic aspects,  \nfollowed by the simultaneous rise of neoliberalism and indigenous ethnonationalism (see \nPerreault, 2003: 66 -71). \nThe position of indigenous organisations vis -\u00e0-vis the Ecuadorian state is further \ncomplicated by the latter\u2019s centralist character under Alia nza Pa\u00eds (AP) government \n(2006 \u2013present ). This was demonstrated most dramatically with the closure in 2013 of the \nNational Directorate of Bilingual Intercultural Education (\u2018Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n \nIntercultural Biling\u00fce\u2019 \u2013DINEIB) and its incorporati on within the Ministry of Education; the \nlatter is under the control of an  AP minister, while the former was controlled by the \n                                                        \n9 \u2018Under the corporatist regime model, Latin American states extended certain social benefits to the \ncitize nry\u2013including subsidies for food, energy and basic consumer goods; low -cost agricultural credit; \nwelfare, education and healthcare benefits \u2013in exchange for the formation of particular modes of state -\nsanctioned organisation and political participation\u2019 (Perreault, 2003: 66).  34 \n indigenous Pachakutik10 (PK)  party, then in coalition with the  MPD ( \u2018Movimiento \nPlurinacional de Izquierdas\u2019 \u2013Left Plurinational Mo vement). As Rafael Correa11 remarked on \nthe subject , when asked about  the government\u2019s relationship with indigenous \norganisations: \u2018There are conceptual differences here: we are not corporativists; the \nindigenous leaders often seek to have institutions which they can control, but we go \nbeyond this fragmented view of the state\u2019 (2012: post -script, page 4).  The argument is \naccurate vis -\u00e0-vis CONAIE -PK, but also disingenuous, given that Alianza Pa\u00eds participates in \nthe very same politicisation of state institutional space by demanding allegiance (and at \ntimes public expressions of  it) from bureaucratic functionaries at all levels.  \nThe preceding paragraphs shoul d not be taken as broadly  condemnatory of public health \npolicies in Ecuador under Alianza Pa\u00eds government. Since 2007 Ecuador has pursued many \nof the same goals advocated by the critical epidemiologists of the Latin American social \nmedicine movement, whose  major target of critique was the application of neoliberalism \nto public health in Latin America from the 1980s (Laurell, 2010: 80). Medical attention is \navailable for free and the state has increased the public health budget by a factor of 4.5 \nsince the c ommencement of the current administration. The healthcare budget is currently \n25 times greater than it was at the turn of the century (Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica, 2015: \n5). As such, public health policy is certainly moving in a positive direction. Even so , \nindigenous peoples continue to suffer doubly: both in terms of their marginalisation from \nthe biomedical resources and expertise mobilised by the public health system and \nconcentrated around the nation\u2019s centres of political and economy gravity; as well as the \n                                                        \n10 Pachakutik is the political party created by CONAIE in 1996.  \n11 President of Ecuador from 2007 until 2017.  35 \n fact that the medical attention that does reach them is oriented around alien concepts and \nframes of references from their own.  \n \nThe Politics of Epistemology in Traditional Medicine  \nThe debate between plurinationalism and interculturality versus t he subtle elitism of \nliberal multiculturalism correlates neatly with differences in the interpretation and \napplication of research in medical anthropology and international public health. This would \nsuggest that the divisions in both of the fields brought together in this research project \nrest on fundamental moral and philosophical principles. I will begin this section by \ndeveloping a summary of these debates in the existing literature, while seeking to \nregularly connect them with the previously outlined de bates in political philosophy. Much \nof the literature deals with the relevant interstice of politics and medicine only through \nhighly theorised disciplinary debates; or, it considers the micro -context of medical \npluralism within the applied framework of co mmunity development, and therefore often \nsidelines examination of the political and philosophical barriers to the implementation of \ntheir research recommendations. There has been little research on the place of traditional \nmedicine in public health that in corporates political -philosophical insights from decolonial \npolitical theory or the politics of epistemology (Bodeker, Kronenberg & Burford, 2007: \n10).12 Consequently, in this chapter I take an active role in constructing \u2018the field\u2019 and its \nbackground lite rature, much of which is not currently in dialogue.  \n                                                        \n12 A notable exception is the related debate surrounding the politics of medical epistemology in \npharmaceutical bioprospecting/biopiracy (Khalil, 1995; Mgbeoji, 2006).  36 \n Many researchers of traditional medicine focus on what they consider its proto -scientific \ncharacteristics, painting it as an empirical practice with various degrees of primitiveness or \nsophistication. Others argue that such a construction distorts the situated nature of such \npractices, which exist in an integrated network of culture and knowledge and cannot \ntherefore be isolated and reduced to a \u2018medical\u2019 domain. Beginning with the former \nperspective, i t is clear that such an approach is tightly bound up with philosophical \nmaterialism and a linear understanding of scientific progress and social development, \nhallmarks of the modernist worldview. If anthropology\u2019s indigenous subjects do believe in \n\u2018far-fetched\u2019 cosmologies, it is only because they \u2013like the Europeans of a bygone era \u2013have \nnot yet developed the technical instruments that would allow them to arrive at the \ninherently more rational explanation. Acting within their technological limitations, \nindig enous peoples have nonetheless discovered insights that could prove to be valuable \nif further \u2018developed\u2019 by the developed nations: thus the calls by some to bring traditional \nmedicine \u2018up -to-date\u2019 (Akarele, 1987). For anyone in conversation with anthropol ogy, such \nan approach to traditional medicine \u2013and indigenous knowledge in general \u2013evokes the \nmuch -maligned \u2018denial of coevalness\u2019 between the primitive and the modern (Fabian, \n1983 ). While such discourse is perfectly compatible with and creates clear policy \nprescriptions for the modernising visions of Third World governments and the project \nmanagement of development institutions, it is too timidly reductionist a frame for the \npresent  study. In this section I will seek to salvage some of the pragmatic elements of the \nmaterialist approach by navigating through the storm of post -structuralist critiques that \nsometimes threaten to leave us without any linguistic resources \u2013not even \u2018culture \u2019\u2013to \n\u2018frame\u2019 our research and \u2018fix\u2019 in place some degree of certainty about the subject.   37 \n The rationalist study of traditional medicine is best exemplified by Edward Green\u2019s \nIndigenous Theories of Contagious Disease  (1999 ), the central thesis of which is that the \nseemingly mystical elements of African beliefs are in essence simply a different  form of \nexpressing the same underlying ideas about disease causation (aetiology) as those that \nare found in biomedical science. As well as being an impressive synthesis of many years of \nfieldwork across numerous African countries, the work is also highly indicative of dynamics \nin the discipline of medical anthropology, as well as in international politics and \ndevelopment circles and the way both influence knowledge production. Green begins his \nwork by sallying forth into the debate in medical anthropology between traditional \nmedicine as proto -scientific practice, as he appears to espouse confidently, and the view \nthat it is an elaborate system of situated knowledge that cannot be adequately \nunderstood outside of its cultural context. He writes that the vood oo-inflected stereotype \nof indigenous African medicine \u2013\u2018witchcraft\u2019, \u2018spirit possession\u2019 and \u2018throbbing drums\u2019 \u2013\n\u2018unfortunately [\u2026] does not come from comic books and Hollywood alone. A number of \nhealth researchers and anthropologists have lent it scientific  credibility\u2019 (1999: 9). \nFollowing this dramatic opening, Green gradually retreats to his more moderate thesis that \n\u2018when it comes to diseases that account for greatest morbidity and mortality [\u2026] the \nindigenous and biomedical aetiological models are in fa ct not very different in \nfundamental and important ways\u2019 (1999: 12). Shortly afterwards, in fact, the debate over \naetiologies becomes one more of style than of substance, for by the end of the \nintroduction the careful reader finds:  \nCertainly a full descrip tion of every type of physical and mental illness in a range of African \nsocieties would reveal ample evidence of personalistic theories [theories of magical \nintervention] of illness causation; and witchcraft, sorcery and spirit beliefs are part of the 38 \n same  cultural construction of knowledge as naturalistic, impersonal aetiology. But my \nargument is that those involved in promoting public health in Africa should take the trouble \nto learn about existing medical systems before trying to supplant them with what sounds to \nmost Africans like Western scientific mumbo -jumbo (1999: 15).  \nIn other words, Green seeks to promote biomedical science in Africa unchanged, but \nadvocates doing so through the use of the existing indigenous terminology of health and \nillness rath er than in spite of it. Such a narrowly delimited understanding of the potential \nof the encounter between knowledge systems is perhaps unsurprising in light of the fact \nthat the project was brought to fruition through development funding from international  \ninstitutions (Green, 1999: 9).  \nThe work\u2019s strategic and development oriented objectives are clear in the contextualising \nforeword offered by W. Penn Handwerker: \u2018Edward Green\u2019s Indigenous Theories of \nContagious Disease  opens the way for development of eff ective working relationships \nbetween biomedical health service providers and for more effective health promotion and \ndisease prevention around the world \u2019 (Green, 1999: 7). Handwerker also brings up the oft -\ncited WHO statistic (Bannerman et al., 1983 ) that almost eighty percent of the world\u2019s \nmedical services are provided by \u2018indigenous healers\u2019 (Green, 1999: 7). Through the WHO \nTraditional Medicine Strategy (2002), following on from the Alma Ata Declaration (19 78), \nthe WHO backs the legitimacy of traditional medicine in the realm of western -dominated \n\u2018global governance\u2019 of health policy. Green justifies his support of this endeavour at length \nin an analysis of medical and public health journals, showing that ove rwhelmingly, the \ndenigration of indigenous health practitioners proceeds on the presumption of their \nirrationality and incapacity for logical reasoning (1999: 220 -224). His rationalising account \nof indigenous practices appears then as a necessary counterpa rt. By legitimating 39 \n indigenous practitioners in this way, he strengthens policy emphases on cross -cultural \nawareness and collaboration, while simultaneously avoiding the imperative to reconsider \nhis own conceptual frame through the cross -cultural encounter .   \nIn considering the politics of traditional medicine, perhaps the most telling part of \nIndigenous Theories of Contagious Disease  is the above -cited opening to the book. In the \nact of mobilising then destroying a straw -man stereotype of the exotic other \u2013\u2018spirit \npossession \u2019 and \u2018throbbing drums \u2019\u2013Green's work belittles the idea of significant and \nmeaningful cultural difference between the West and sub -Saharan Africa. The suggestion, \ninstead, is humanist: the other is in fact just like us, and moreover it wo uld be somewhat \noffensive to believe otherwise. In this procedure we can see clear parallels between the \npolitical philosophy of liberal multiculturalism and Green\u2019s own line of argumentation: \nliberation is envisioned as achievable through the granting of equality, rather the \nreclamation of difference. The purpose of cross -cultural awareness, from this perspective, \nis simply an understanding of a particular cultural context that facilitates the translation \nand dissemination of one\u2019s own system of knowledge into that context. From the \nperspective of interculturality, by contrast, cultural difference should set off constructive \nprocesses that hold the potential to be transformative for all parties (Walsh, 2002: 24 -26), \nrather than a program embedded in relations of power that reinforces pre -existing cultural \nand epistemic dominance on all levels.  \n \nBioprospecting and the Encounter betwee n Knowledge Systems  \nThis same form of rationalising advocacy \u2013seeking to legitimise aspects of indigenous \nknowledge by emphasising its similarity with bodies of knowledge in western societies \u201340 \n was evident in the International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups (ICBG) bioprospecting13 \nproject carried out amongst indigenous groups in southern Mexico. The ICBG Maya, as it \nwas known, was unusual in that it based its collection of plant specimens on local \nknowledge of medicinally useful species, rather than simply seeking to randomly colle ct \nlarge numbers of plants, and in this regard alone it was for some an important validation \nof indigenous knowledges. It was planned largely by two anthropologists with decades of \nexperience in the region, Brent and Elois Berlin, who sought to create a su stainable \ndevelopment oriented alliance with pharmaceutical bioprospecting researchers, so as to \ngenerate local benefits, including royalties and construction programs, but also programs \nto train local people in botanical and scientific methods and to stim ulate local esteem for \ntraditional knowledge (Berlin & Berlin, 2004: 474 -8). Th e Berlins\u2019 research -advocacy \njustified the decision to focus the study on local knowledge of traditional medicine by \npresenting Mayan medical knowledge as \u2018an ethnoscientific system [...] based on astute \nand accurate observation that have only been elabora ted on the basis of many years of \nexplicit empirical experimentation with the effects of herbal remedies on bodily function\u2019 \n(1996: 53 ). This representation of Mayan traditional medicine should be understood in light \nof the structure of the ICBG program, in  which royalties to be received by indigenous \ngroups could be expected to be between one and six percent of the total, which would \nthen have to be shared with any host -nation institutions collaborating in the research \n(Greene, 2004: 215 ; Hayden, 2003: 369 ). The amount could nonetheless be a huge windfall, \nyet it does suggest that presenting Mayan traditional medicine as an \u2018ethnoscientific \nsystem\u2019 was less about researchers\u2019 confidence in the astuteness and accuracy of its \n                                                        \n13 Bioprospecting entails the collection of plants and other  organisms to be scanned for novel chemical \ncompounds, typically for use in medicine, agro -industry or cosmetics.   41 \n empirical method and more about convincing actors for whom it was suspect that Mayan \ntraditional medicine had the validity to serve even as the starting -point for a large research \nproject. Interestingly, the same description of indigenous medicine was used by the lead \nresearcher in the ICBG Aguaruna, based on the medicinal plant knowledge of the Aguaruna \npeople of the Peruvian Amazon.14 Walter Lewis, biochemist and ethnobota nist at \nWashington University, has depicted the development of Aguaruna ethnomedicinal \nknowledge as based on \u2018empirical methodology\u2019 (Lewis & Elvin -Lewis, 1991 ) and \n\u2018traditional testing and selecting\u2019 of plants (Lewis, 2003: 130 ). The matching discursive \nframes employed by Lewis and the Berlins and their success in securing funding suggest \nthat such a presentation of traditional medicine was the most advantageous way to \npresent such proposals to US -based research institutes.  \nThis style of legitimising indigenous medicinal knowledge by presenting its most \nacceptable face to an audience operating within a rationalist, scientific paradigm has come \nunder attack from some anthro pologists. They have critiqued the conclusion that \nindigenous peoples\u2019 traditional medicine is proto -scientific as an artifice of the research \nprocess itself and a frame that shapes its area of study rather than simply representing it. \nRobert Pool, a medic al anthropologist who carried out research in Cameroon, makes this \ncritique most explicitly, arguing that medical anthropologists\u2019 studies of \u2018medical systems\u2019 \ninevitably turn up practices and beliefs that can be brought together to formulate such a \nsystem . Moreover, he argues that \u2018by the very attempt to study and describe it as \nsomething discrete,\u2019 such research ends up \u2018not only creating an indigenous medical \n                                                        \n14 The Aguaruna (\u2018awaj\u00fan,\u2019 in Spanish) are a Jivaroan people who are closely related culturally and \nlinguistically to the Shuar and participa te in cross -border activism and organisation with Shuar people in \nZamora -Chinchipe.  42 \n domain but also reducing it to a somewhat inferior version of biomedicine\u2019 (1994: 15 ). From \nthis perspective, the attempt to elevate a distant culture from the position of ignorance \nthey are assumed to be in by the wider public to a reasonable degree of rationality is \nmerely painting th at culture as well -intentioned imitators rather than hopeless savages. \nPool concludes that \u2018the ideology which has to be opposed here is not blatant cultural \nimperialism but rather liberal humanism\u2019 (1994: 16). The flipside of this well -aimed criticism \nis the methodological quandary typical of post -structuralist orientations: if the \u2018dissolution \nof ethnomedical systems\u2019 is deemed necessary, what is the terminology to replace it? In \nfact, the same question recurs in Pool\u2019s use of the term \u2018witchcraft.\u2019 In hi s article, it is both \na ill-intentioned act of sorcery, mirroring its meaning historically in the European context, \nand a general theory of misfortune, the sub -Saharan African worldview that Pool argued \nis subsumed by a study of \u2018medical systems\u2019 (1994: 16 ). \nLike Pool, Ronald Nigh criticises the rationalising portrayal of traditional medicine, in his \nresponse to the Berlins\u2019 presentation of Mayan medicine as an \u2018ethnoscientific system.\u2019 \nNigh argued that in focusing their bioprospecting research purely on Ma yan use of herbs \u2013\nclearly the most acceptable form of traditional medicine when viewed from the \nperspective of medical science \u2013the Berlins decontextualised healing practice among the \nMaya and were therefore guilty of \u2018herbal fetishism\u2019 (Nigh, 2002 ).15 In the heated political \ndebate around the ICBG Maya which eventually led to its cessation, particularly the \naccusations of biopiracy against the research group, Nigh sided with the opposition that \nformed around a union of healers and midwives, arguing:  \n                                                        \n15 A similar criticism has been made of state intercultural health programs in Mexico (Ayora Diaz, 2007: 143).  43 \n [the] biological gaze [of pharmaceutical research] decontextualizes the situated knowledge \nof Maya healers, ignoring the cultural context in which they create and apply that knowledge. \nThe search for raw materials f or the production of universal medical technology results in \nsymbolic violence to the cultural logic of Maya peoples (2002: 451).  \nThe Berlins in fact responded to Nigh\u2019s article: they regarded his emphasis on spirituality \nin Mayan healing practices as \u2018a r omantic and exotic vision of the Highland Maya that has \nlittle to do with the empirical procedures that they employ in dealing with healing and \nsickness in everyday life\u2019 (2002: 465).  \nThe repetition of this question in debates over anthropological represe ntation illustrates \nthat it is not sufficient to seek to simply to increase awareness and esteem for indigenous \ncultures, for this can be done in different directions with different ends. Moreover, these \ndebates suffer from an extraneous desire to uncover the truth about a specific social issue \nwithout sufficient reflection on the purpose or the conditions of possibility of their \nresearch. For the Berlins, the focus on the chemistry of medicinal herbs is a necessary \nmethod that mirrors the pharmaceutical in dustry\u2019s focus on isolated active ingredients \ncapable of being industrially mass -produced, and therefore capable of satisfying social \ncustoms of intellectual property, industrial patent laws and an entire value set based on \nefficiency, centralisation of pr oduction, purity, and the domination and enhancement of \nnature. Their research, then, is less an act of \u2018symbolic violence\u2019 than one of cross -cultural \ntranslation necessitated by broader socio -cultural structures over which the Berlins have \nvery little inf luence. For Nigh, his intention to counter the Berlins\u2019 project denies all of the \nbenefits that could arise from such a project, as incomplete as it may be as an evaluation \nof the healing capacity of Mayan health -seeking practice. Even once completely conv inced \nof Nigh\u2019s portrayal of the ICBG Maya as decontextualising, constructing and framing 44 \n Mayan medicinal knowledge in such a way as to create a truth that is no more than an \nartifice of the research process, one could ask, following Latour, so what? The \n\u2018constructed\u2019 nature of knowledge does not prevent it from being valuable; in fact, in most \ncases its \u2018constructed\u2019 character is what makes research interesting, useful and novel \n(Latour, 2004: 213 , Latour, 2010: 19) . The ICBG Maya decontextual ised indigenous \nknowledge because it sought to apply it in a new context, and the only problem with that \nwould be any claim that such a study provided the final verdict on Mayan healing, on its \nusefulness in its own context, and on its right to exist and b e represented in the institutions \nthat govern its own social space.  \n \nShuar Healing and Traditional Medicine Debates  \nThe Shuar situation parallels that of the Maya in that their knowledge of the therapeutic \nvalue of medicinal plants is but one aspect of a  richer tradition, in spite of herbalism being \nemphasised in global discussions on traditional medicine. Herbalism is certainly a broadly \nused part of the range of health -seeking practices available to Shuar people in Zamora -\nChinchipe, including in those a reas where clinical consultation and pharmaceutical \nmedicines are available. Its practice ranges from the everyday use of herbal teas for \nameliorating subtle, emerging health complaints; includes the use of a number of plant -\nderived tonics, most commonly a lcohol -based extracts, for physical invigoration or the \nmanagement of chronic conditions; and is also called upon to resolve severe health \nproblems (some cases of which are presented in Chapter 6). In addition, many Shuar \npeople seek out the advice and tre atment of professional herbalists, principally mestizos, \nin Ecuadorian cities and towns. Consultation with these herbalists, moreover, blurs any 45 \n preconceptions one may have of herbalism as a proto -scientific, physiological form of \ntreatment, as the prescri ption of herbal medicines may sit side -by-side with prayers aimed \nat divine forgiveness, or at uncovering the source of the \u2018envy\u2019 that caused the illness.  \nEnvy, its harmful effects and potential resolution are also the central concern within \ncontemporary Shuar shamanism. This technical vocabulary shared between mestizo and \nShuar healers points to the syncretism emerging in Shuar culture as its practitioners find \nthemselves in greater day -to-day proximity with Ecuadorian campesino society (see \nChapter 4, \u2018T he Shamanic Diagnosis of Sorcery\u2019). Nonetheless, for Shuar people, as with \nmost of the indigenous peoples of north -west Amazonia, the incorporation of ayahuasca16 \nin shamans\u2019 diagnostic and treatment process adds a degree of sophistication not found \namong m estizo herbalists. Shuar shamans typically imbibe ayahuasca in order to diagnose \ntheir patients\u2019 ailments, saying that it allows them to \u2018see\u2019 through their patients\u2019 bodies \nand determine what has befallen them (see Chapter 4). Thus for Shuar people,  sham anism \nprecedes herbalism in many cases, and is often the first -choice diagnostic tool, depending \non the perceived cause of the illness in question. Yet shamanism is typically bracketed as \na culture -bound practice that is completely dependent on belief for its efficacy; as such, \nparticular types of shamanic practice supposedly cannot have cross -cultural relevance. \nThis analysis divides scientific objectivity as representative of the real from subjective \nexperience as synonymous with belief, placebo and illus ion. Biomedical practice places the \nformer with physiologically active chemical treatments and brackets it away from \npsychology. The latter is then divided between the subjectively experienced treatments \n                                                        \n16 Ayahuasca (Sp.: \u2018ayahuasca\u2019; Shuar: nat\u00e9m ; Latin: Banisterio psis caapi), also commonly called \u2018yag\u00e9\u2019, \u2018yaji\u2019 \nand \u2018caapi\u2019, refers to both the ayahuasca plant itself, as well a s a brew produced from the self -same plant \nalong with various admixtures depending on local availability and preference.  46 \n along the lines of psychotherapy and the psychiatric  medications that treat the mind as an \nobjective unit of study for physiological interventions. Yet ayahuasca shamanism seems to \nwork on all sides. Physiologically active chemicals effect complex bodily interventions \nwhile simultaneously working on the min d and psycho -emotional state (Dom\u00ednguez -Clav\u00e9 \net. al., 2016), opening a space for a form of non -verbal psychotherapy led by the shaman \nas therapist (Illius, 1992: 66). Yet unfortunately, all of this complexity is elided by the \naforementioned \u2018post -cultural \u2019 pretensions of the secular western world, which assumes \nthat those aspects of an alien knowledge practice which cannot be understood within \nwestern scientific epistemology are hopelessly bounded within a particular cultural  \nsubjective experience  and have no significance outside of it.  \nNonetheless, contemporary social research on shamanism continues reproduc ing the \nassumption  of cultural boundedness, which can be traced back to  Claude L\u00e9vi -Strauss \n(1963). In Structural Anthropolo gy, the cynical shaman Quesalid served as an anchor for \nthe notion that indigenous healing lacks substantive content, and that therefore the task \nof the anthropologist is to seek to explain how such beliefs could exist , and to explain \nefficacy in terms of belief. Thus, L\u00e9vi -Strauss wrote that \u2018the efficacy of magic implies a \nbelief in magic\u2019 in which \u2018the faith and expectations of the group [\u2026] constantly act as a \nsort of gravitational field\u2019 (1963: 168). The structuralist bias of placin g the social whole as \nthe unit of analysis comes forth here. \u2018The value of the system,\u2019 L\u00e9vi -Strauss explained, is \nbased upon \u2018the sense of security that the group receives from the myth underlying the \ncure and from the popular system upon which the group\u2019 s universe is reconstructed\u2019 \n(1963: 183). Neither proposition is particularly useful in the Shuar context. For one, the \nimportance of a shaman\u2019s performance is minimal and even the presence of an audience \nis atypical. Secondly, as we shall see in Chapter 4 , Shuar social relations are individualistic 47 \n and extend beyond the individual primarily via extended family networks rather than \u2018the \ncommunity.\u2019 If we must speak of \u2018the Shuar\u2019 for the sake of simplicity \u2013in spite of their \npeople\u2019s historic absence of comm unal forms of social organisation, identity, economy and \nspirituality \u2013it is also true that their allegiances to given forms of healing practice are \nfragmented and varied, depending on multiple factors impacting upon the way they live \nout their inherited cu lture. These factors \u2013the most significant of which relate to \ngeographic isolation, Protestant Evangelism, wage labour and discourses of indigeneity \u2013\naccount for a dramatic degree of intracultural diversity within the Shuar population even \nof as small a prov ince as Zamora -Chinchipe. Consequently, the reconstruction of the \nmeaning of a shared universe cannot be considered an explanation for the practice of \nshamanism. Even less so, in the medically plural context of Zamora -Chinchipe, could there \nbe said to be a  metaphysical comfort to be taken in the effective functioning of a particular \nshaman him/herself.  \nThis classical conception of shamanism has been sidestepped rather than superseded in \ncontemporary accounts of \u2018performativity.\u2019 The argument is typified in Michael Taussig\u2019s \n(2006: 221 ) excavation of Edward Burnett Tylor\u2019s Primitive Culture , in wh ich Tylor argued: \n\u2018The sorcerer generally learns his time -honoured profession in good faith, and retains his \nbelief in it more or less from first to last; at once dupe and cheat, he combines the energy \nof a believer with the cunning of a hypocrite\u2019 (1871: 121). Taussig\u2019s solution is not to expand \nupon the representation of the shaman as both dupe and hypocrite, but rather to do away \nwith the idea that this represents a problem to be explained. \u2018It is as if the paradox is an \nartefact of the Enlightenment,\u2019 h e writes (2006: 235 ); rather, \u2018the secret of the secret is \nthat there is none, or, rather, that the secret is a public secret\u2019 (2006: 246 ). In this same \nway, shamanistic rites have been compared to clowning tricks in children\u2019s hospitals, 48 \n which cure clients by re -enchanting their world (Miller van Blerkom, 1995: 241 ). These \ninterpretations of shamanic healing as dependent on performativity and cultural context \navoid the substantive content of shamans\u2019 practice and thereby bracket their relevance  as \nmarginal.  \nSuch reductive conceptualisations will have to be superseded in this study for any \nmeaningful framework for interculturality to be constructed. By virtue of acting on both \nthe mind and the body and intertwining aspects of therapy, herbalism and personal \ndevelopment (as will be discussed in Chapter 4), ayahuasca shamanism is the most \npotentially productive and epistemologically complex Amazonian healing practices with \nwhich biomedicine could engage. The way in which this one Shuar healing prac tice seems \nto continually cut across the categories we use to understand health, sickness and our own \nphysically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually and psychologically entwined states of being \ndraws attention to the significance of differences in epistemo logy and ontology when \ncomparing and analysing the health -seeking practices of distinct cultures. The aspects of \nhuman experience about which truth claims can be made, and the refusal to make such \nclaims about other aspects of human experience, are arbitra ry artefacts of a cultural \ngroup\u2019s socio -historical experience. For this reason, the analysis and evaluation of one \ngroup of people\u2019s set of health -seeking practices according to the epistemology and \nontology of another is not simply biased; it also misses  insights into illness and healing that \nare far more powerful than, say, the choice of a certain herb for a specific ailment. For \nstate health institutions to meaningfully represent and support such an indigenous healing \npractice, their structure and opera tions need to be reconsidered from the root, starting \nwith the most fundamental ontological assumptions.  49 \n De Facto Interculturality in the Borderlands of the Ecuadorian State  \nIf interculturality as delineated thus far is taken as the point of departure fo r the debate \non the place of traditional medicine in public health, the partisan positions delineated \nabove dissolve. We are no longer obliged to subordinate indigenous health -seeking \npreferences and quixotically seek to assess their appropriateness from w ithin the norms \nestablished by medical science, nor to abandon the so -called \u2018symbolic violence\u2019 of \npromoting the truths and practices of any one system of health -seeking knowledge \npractice outside its original context. Instead, interculturality simply req uires that the \ninstitutions of the state be representative and supportive of the culture of the people. For \nShuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe, this culture is constituted by a range of preferences \nbetween shamans, professional mestizo herbalists, plant -base d home remedies and \nclinical medical doctors, all of which are available to them to varying degrees. As such, the \ncollation of these preferences should form one iteration of \u2018border knowledge\u2019 (Alcoff, \n2007: 93): an accumulated, experience -based knowledge of the efficacy for them  of each \nof a range of knowledge practices which are in turn grounded in the varying epistemic and \nontological postulates implied by these practices. This implies respect for the intensity of \nresources and technical and professional  capacities currently concentrated under the \numbrella of biomedical science; but also attention to the lived experiences of illness and \nhealing of Shuar people and the way they reveal the degree to which the products of \nbiomedicine may or may not travel ef fectively outside their geographical and cultural \nlocations of origin effectively, or may or not compare favourably with existing practices in \nother locations. The greater part of the sweat and ink expended in this research project \nhas been dedicated to do cumenting these preferences between healing practices as held \nby Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe.  50 \n Chapter 3 offers a statistical summary of Shuar health -seeking practices in the province. \nEverything that can be explained in a quantitative and only minimally interpreted manner \nis presented here: the responses of interviewees regarding their preferences between \nshamanism, herbalism and clinical medicine; the reasons they defer to one or the other; \nand whether or not they are open -minded enough to pursue multiple options until they \nsucceed. What emerges most forcefully as these declared preferences on the part of Shuar \npeople are rendered visible is the diversity of their responses; there is little coherence in \nthe preferences of interviewees who simply share an ethnic identity as Shuar and live on \ncommunally -titled indigenous Shuar territory. On the contra ry, the continuities are to be \nfound along other faultlines: the greater willingness to see doctors and purchase \npharmaceuticals amongst Shuar wage -labourers; the greater importance placed by Shuar \npeople living in isolated regions on the education and soc ialisation of their children \nthrough visionary spiritual practices, in contrast with those who are closer to roads, \ntelevision and electric lights; and the way Evangelical Shuar have abandoned elements of \nancestral healing practice and redeployed others. T his of course throws the project of \ninterculturality into confusion: if it was not enough to aim at remaking the foundational \nprinciples of a sector of the state, it turns out there is very little consistency in Shuar views \n(let alone \u2018indigenous views\u2019), even within a single, small and isolated province. Is \ninterculturality, then, a vain hope? And what does it say of our understanding of \u2018culture\u2019 \nthat an attempt to delineate how to make a sector of the state culturally representative is \nso fraught with co mplication?  \nChapters 4 to 7 are an attempt to make conceptual sense of the Shuar interviewees\u2019 \nhealth -seeking practices in order to answer these questions. These are the most properly \nethnographic chapters of the dissertation. However, rather than forming  a thorough 51 \n analysis of an imaginary coherent body of Shuar health -seeking knowledge and practice as \nunderstood by Shuar people themselves, so as to illustrate their congruences and \ndissonances with clinical medicine, each chapter instead gives an account of one of the \n\u2018faultlines\u2019 just mentioned. I propose that each of these subsets of Shuar society in \nZamora -Chinchipe is principally characterised by a distinct \u2018cultural vector\u2019 and its \nrelationship with the ancestral culture and ontology inherited by toda y\u2019s Shuar people. \nCultural vectors are conceived of as historically contingent, primarily external forces \nimpacting upon and changing the culture of the people with whom they come into \ncontact. If we accept that the decisions arrived at in moments of healt h crisis are indicative \nof people\u2019s most fundamental ontological commitments, then the health -seeking \npreferences of Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe reveal the most significant cultural \nforces at work on Shuar indigenous territory. These cultural vectors are geographic \nisolation (Chapter 4), Protestant Evangelism (Chapter 5), waged labour in the mining \nindustry (Chapter 6) and the international discourse of indigeneity (Chapter 7). Geographic \nisolation is the product of historically contingent forces \u2013notab ly state priorities of \nsovereignty and development and the conflict between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian \nstates \u2013and as such is an external vector, even though its effect is to bring more powerfully \nto the fore the ancestral culture of those Shuar people liv ing in the border regions of south -\neastern Ecuador.  \nA theoretical antecedent here is Jill DeTemple\u2019s (2015) notion of \u2018social vectors\u2019. \nDeTemple\u2019s reasoning for proposing an addition to our theoretical vocabulary is much the \nsame as my own. The notion of a  vector not only implies an impact of specific magnitude, \nrange, direction and so on; it also signifies effects that surpass the isolation of culture and \nhuman experience into separate pieces named ontology, productive activity, subjectivity 52 \n and discourse.  Instead, discourses suggest specific ontologies and productive activities; \nproductive activities have their own preferred subjectivities and discourses; ontologies \nimply certain kinds of productive activities and subjectivities while negating others \n(Desc ola, 2013b: 386); and so on. As DeTemple puts it, all of these domains are \u2018bundled\u2019, \nin the sense that vectors are \u2018dynamic bundles of ideas, institutions and actions that carry \nvalues, relational hierarchies and cosmological explanations for historical e vents and social \npositioning\u2019 (2015: 157). This bundled quality of cultural vectors results in unanticipated \nconsequences: even if, for example, waged mining may appear to be congruent with \ncertain ancestral health -seeking practices, as a vector it acts to  modify not only Shuar \npeople\u2019s predominant productive activities, but is also suggestive of particular ways of \nseeing the world, understanding their identity and expressing themselves (see Chapter 6, \n\u2018The Mechanics of Disbelief in the Quimi River Valley\u2019) . The use of \u2018vector\u2019 in this sense also \nrecalls Judith Butler\u2019s interpretation of the Foucaultian notion of power, which acts \nrepeatedly and at a distance that is often beyond the control of those with whom said \npower originated (Butler, 1997: 91), a germ ane point for Shuar people experiencing \nbiomedicine, wage labour and Evangelical religion at the furthest edge of the world -\nsystem.17 These nuances of intermingled external cultural impacts bring colour to the \nportrait of remarkable intracultural diversity among Shuar people that is sketched \nquantitatively in black and white in Chapter 3.  \nIn contrast to DeTemple, however, I prefer to classify geographic isolation, Protestant \nEvangelism, wage labour and the international discourse of indigeneity as \u2018cultural vectors\u2019 \n                                                        \n17 \u2018In this formulatio n, there is no body outside of power, for the materiality of the body \u2013indeed, materiality \nitself \u2013is produced by and in direct relation to the investment of power. The materiality of the prison [\u2026] is \nestablished to the extent that [\u2026] it is a vector and in strument of power\u2019 (Butler, 1997: 91).   53 \n in reference to their impact upon the field of culture \u2013in this case, that of Shuar people in \nZamora -Chinchipe \u2013in the same sense that biological vectors carry biological material \nwhich is transferred from the point of origin to the target. They are  not cultural vectors in \na sense that would suggest their provenance within a single culture and thereby invoke a \ndichotomous clash between \u2018western\u2019 and \u2018indigenous\u2019 culture. Indeed, of the \naforementioned vectors, Protestant Evangelism blends North Americ an puritanism with \nelements of both monotheism and philosophical materialism; the waged labour regime in \nthe region under study is implemented by a Chinese state -owned company with its own \nparticular business culture; and the discourse of indigeneity combi nes history with \nEuropean Romantic tropes and multiple forms of activism across a range of international \nsites. Each vector has such significant impacts upon Shuar culture that, as we shall see in \nChapter 3, they fragment any possibility of describing that  culture in a unitary manner \nreminiscent of \u2018culture\u2019 as a synonym for ethnicity. So these cultural vectors are not \nuniformly \u2018western,\u2019 just as they do not act upon a culturally homogenous group. On the \nother hand, the ontological and epistemological pres umptions of ancestral Shuar healing \npractices (documented in Chapter 4) continue to influence the way in which Shuar people \nare willing to adopt the cultural vectors that reach them (as we see particularly in Chapter \n5, \u2018One Vector Amongst Many\u2019). As such,  contra the overriding emphasis commonly placed \non anti -essentialism, I agree with Alejandro Grimson and Pablo Sem\u00e1n that culture should \nnot, in a conceptual sense, \u2018concede itself to the infinite multiplication of agency and \nsubjects\u2019 in a manner that wou ld reflect liberal, individualist suppositions and dissolve its \nsignificance for the analysis of human collectives and difference (2005: 15 -16). Throughout \nthis thesis the \u2018culture\u2019 upon which cultural vectors impact is taken to signify a real and \nsignific ant field encapsulating the collective particularity of the Shuar people, which is 54 \n both a historical product and continually in fluxes of reproduction, change and destruction \nvia complex engagements. The fact that these engagements and their effects on Shu ar \nculture are highly complex does not mean that they cannot be made sense of, or that \nculture itself is an unworkable analytical tool.  \nKey elements employed in this thesis in the analysis of Shuar culture\u2019s fragmentation, \nreproduction and change have just  been referenced \u2013ontology, subjectivity and productive \nactivity \u2013and only the latter is self -explanatory. The emergence of \u2018ontology\u2019 as an \nintellectual buzzword has resulted in some imprecise usage. In \u2018multi -species \nethnography,\u2019 for example, the phrase \u2018 ontological difference\u2019 is used to reference the \ndifference between humans and animals (e.g. Rose, 2012). Properly speaking, where \u2018onto -\n\u2019 references the state of being or reality and \u2018 -ology\u2019 refers to \u2018the study of\u2019 or \u2018knowledge \nabout,\u2019 ontology signifi es \u2018knowledge about the nature of being and reality\u2019 (and also, \nconsequently, of non -being and unreality).18 As such, in multi -species ethnography it would \nbe more accurate to refer to the clear differences between humans and animals as \u2018ontic\u2019 \nthan as \u2018ont ological,\u2019 unless one wished to speculate about the postulates made by \nanimals about the nature of reality. By contrast, the \u2018ontological differences\u2019 between \nShuar and biomedical healing references the divergent assumptions about what is and is \nnot real t hat are held by the practitioners, clients, regulators, and so on, of each knowledge \nsystem. In this example, the most clear case of ontological difference would be the Shuar \nnotion that non -ordinarily visible parallel planes of reality exist and are inhab ited by beings \nwhich interact with humans and may contribute to wellbeing or cause illness. To extend \nthe example, the Shuar practice of seeking out the visions experienced in dreams and \n                                                        \n18 Harner\u2019s (1968) \u2018reality view\u2019 is a good approximation of how I use the term.  55 \n under the influence of hallucinogenic plants, which are held by Shuar  people to allow them \nto access information about such non -ordinarily visible planes of reality, represents an \n\u2018epistemological difference\u2019 between Shuar and scientific, materialist practices of seeking \nout knowledge. My understanding of subjectivity, fina lly, draws on Karl Marx\u2019s assertion \nthat \u2018[t]he human essence is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In its reality \nit is the ensemble of the social relations\u2019 (1972[1845]): 145). It is used in this thesis to \ndescribe the distinct, traceable  ways in which transnational cultural vectors shape how \nShuar individuals understand themselves and their place in the world.  \nThe dissertation concludes with a reconsideration of the value placed on cultural diversity \nthat is implicit to a utilitarian cal l for interculturality and plurinationalism. Every particular \nintermingling of inherited culture and global cultural vectors generates unique sets of \nknowledge, assumptions and practices as means of coping and surviving, but such sets of \nknowledge and prac tice do not advance and become more and more sophisticated in a \nperiod of weeks or months. If knowledges and cultures are constantly evolving or being \ndestroyed in the ferment of history, we need to acknowledge and support those that have \nbeen bequeathed t o humanity in the present day. As such, indigenous culture should be \nrecognised not just as an expression of human diversity, but as \u2018a synonym for that which \nhas endured\u2019 (Meyer, 2013: 98).  \n \n \n \n 56 \n Chapter 2: Why Interculturalise? Pluralising the Epistemology  of Medicine  \n \nThe present chapter begins by describing the research methods employed in this project \nand explaining their rationale, starting with the process of moving between Shuar \ncommunities in the province of Zamora -Chinchipe and carrying out intervie ws to \ndetermine health -seeking preferences. In so doing, the endeavour follows the \nepistemological proposal of Walter Mignolo\u2019s \u2018border thinking\u2019 (2000a),19 which, showing \nan affinity between post -colonial criticism and the methodological priorities of feminist \ncritiques of science (Harding, 2009: 416), calls for an approach grounded in popular \nknowledge so as to counter the hegemony of colonially instituted epistemology and \nassociated ruling relations. In spaces in which knowledge practices based on the dominant \nepistemology are only partially available and coexist with other kinds of knowledge \npractices, the only way to determine their relative suitability i s via the accounts of the \npeople who make use of them. As such, in this research the practice of multi -sited \nethnography within Shuar territory is essential in order to minimise the bias inevitable \nwhen an anthropologist adopts the perspective of a particu lar family or household and \nsubsequently claims to comprehend the culture as a whole.  \nIn the second section, I contend that such an ethnographic documentation of \ninterculturality is a valid and important role for the non -indigenous anthropologist. The \nproject of bringing together critical epistemology and (medical) ethnography requires the \n                                                        \n19 Mignolo\u2019s project has been criticised for minimising the relevance of women\u2019s, workers\u2019 and \nenvironmental movements by focusing only on the difference between indigenous and colonial society \n(Domingues, 2009: 129). However, the encounter between western b iomedicine and Shuar healing \npractices founded on a distinctly different ontology, epistemology and culture of healing more closely \nresembles the classical idea of the colonial encounter on which Mignolo\u2019s theories appear to be modelled.  57 \n ability to both explicate the historical contingency of one\u2019s own society\u2019s systems of \nknowledge and the rulings relations sustaining them (see Mato, 2000: 487), while a lso \nmaking those of other societies comprehensible within the vocabulary of one\u2019s own. Both \nof these capacities are necessary for state interculturality to be politically feasible. Before \nmoving to the latter in Chapter 3, this chapter presents a case stud y of medical science \nresearch in order to achieve the former. The example chosen as a case study is a \npharmaceutical bioprospecting research project carried out in the northern Peruvian \nAmazon, the ICBG Aguaruna, named for the Jivaroan20 people (closely rel ated to the \nShuar) upon whose medicinal plant knowledge the research was based. This encounter \nbetween medical knowledge systems brings both into starker relief, \u2018bringing attention to \nthe interactive and unequal dynamics of power that shape culture making  across \nrelationships of difference,\u2019 as emphasised by anthropologists working on ethnographies \nof encounter (Faier & Rofel, 2014: 364).  \nThis process of decentring modern western epistemology through interculturality forces \nus to return to a reconceptuali sation of the concept of culture itself. With cultures placed \non an equal plane of legitimacy with equivalent rights to be represented within the \nintercultural state, it becomes impossible to continue to adhere to the modernist \nworldview, in which, as Phil ippe Descola argues:  \nWe do not envision non -Western civilizations, or even pre -modern Western ones, as complete \nsystems of conceptualization of the world alternative to our own, but as more or less exotic \n                                                        \n20 The Jivaroan pe oples include the Shuar, Achuar, Shiwiar, Maina, Aguaruna and Huambisa peoples, who \nare all extremely closely related in a linguistic sense. As Descola explains (1996: 223), at least for the first \nthree of those groups, their meanings depended as much on t he inter -group political tensions of the \nmoment as on the objective characteristics of the people to which they referred. In Spanish, the term \n\u2018j\u00edvaro\u2019 is now considered pejorative.  58 \n ways of accounting for the state of the world that  our own system of conceptualization has \nestablished (2013a: 30).  \nThis is not to argue that ontology is just another word for culture, but instead signifies \nmaking ontology a subset of culture. In other words, each ontology \u2013each set of \nassumptions about b eing, non -being and what counts as real and unreal \u2013is culturally \nspecific, notwithstanding the potential for overlap between the ontology of one culture \nand that of another. This view is counterposed to seeing the domain of culture as the \ndemarcation of on e aspect of the world within our own ontology, which is characterised \nby the presumption of a divide between nature and culture. Whatever our ontological \ncommitments, the principle of interculturality requires the suspension of disbelief so as to \navoid tac itly privileging the ontology of one culture or another. Attention to Roy Wagner\u2019s \nnotion of culture as \u2018a total system of conceptualisation\u2019 (1981: 142) thus sits neatly \nalongside the intercultural refusal to endorse any one particular culture or worldvie w. As \nsuch, a further aspect of theoretical import to this thesis is interculturality as a distinct \napproach to the politics of the so -called ontological turn (Kohn, 2015) and its importance \nto epistemic pluralism, a theme to be discussed in the third and final section of this chapter.  \n \nMulti -Sited Ethnography and the Field of Research  \nInterculturality, understood as the political imperative of cultural representativeness in \nstate institutions, requires that the automatic privileging of any particular kno wledge \nsystem be abandoned. In drawing comparisons regarding the effectiveness of healing \npractices from traditions with distinct epistemologies and ontologies, then, the \nexperiences of people with a range of different healing practices at their disposal w ould 59 \n appear to be the best guide. The documentation of such context of \u2018medical pluralism\u2019 has \nbeen a prominent topic within cultural anthropology around the world (Adams & Hawkins, \n2007; Frankel & Lewis, 2012; Koss -Chioino, Leatherman & Greenway, 2003); a nd yet there \nis a degree of retooling required in order to employ the standard methods of cultural \nanthropology in the service of state interculturality. Medical anthropologists have often \npursued research through close association with a single individual  (Rubenstein, 2002), \nfamily (Crandon -Malamud, 1991) or small community (Greenway, 1998), which can open \nthe way to profound insights on the personal and political identifications provoked by \nillness and healing and by shifting relations with one\u2019s own and other systems of \nknowledge. On the other hand, such a method of research may be too \u2018zoomed in\u2019 to \nspeak the language of the state. It can portray one facet of human experience in high \ndefinition, but not necessarily show how common such experiences may be . The problem \nparallels broader concerns in the discipline with the methodological inheritance of the era \nof formal colonialism, especially such presumptions as cultural homogeneity and the \ntimelessness of indigenous culture, to be represented via an ethno graphic present that \neschews historicism. These assumptions are now more untenable than ever, as indigenous \ngroups grapple with the challenges and opportunities of economic integration, NGO \ninterventions, state policies and resurgent religious proselytism,  all of which tend to cross -\ncut cultural groups and introduce their own divisions and new hybridised cultural forms. \nIn spite of this, anthropology as ethnography via participant observation persists as a \ndisciplinary default, particularly in those regions  of the world \u2013like Amazonia \u2013that seem to \nresemble the anthropological ideal of bounded, ethno -linguistically defined cultural \ngroups.  60 \n For these reasons, this thesis proposes to address its central problematic via a multi -sited \nethnography that surveys the  health -seeking practices of Shuar people across a broad \nterritory corresponding to a specific political jurisdiction. Though certain Shuar healing \npractices have migrated to nearby mestizo populations, in a manner similar to that \ndocumented by Stephan Bey er (2009) in the Peruvian -Amazonian province of Loreto, the \nontological assumptions upon which these practices are founded have not. As such, the \nShuar population represents what an intercultural state should recognise as a healthcare \nconstituency: in othe r words, a group whose health -seeking preferences need specific \nconsideration on the part of the state\u2019s public health institutions. Surveying these \npreferences demands a multi -sited ethnography. I use the term in a fashion distinct from \nthat of George Mar cus (1995) and Paul Rabinow (1986: 241), whose focus is \u2018developing by \nother means and methods the world system context\u2019 while still \u2018preserv[ing] the \nintensively -focused -upon single site of ethnographic observation\u2019 (Marcus, 1995: 96). By \ncontrast, thanks  to the luxuries of space presented in this thesis, my methodological \napproach here is to combine the world system contextualisation \u2013in this case, by situating \nbiomedical science as a particular manifestation of a socio -historical experience and \nexplicatin g its ruling relations as a hegemonic knowledge system \u2013with multi -sited \nresearch within the ethnographic location itself.  \nBroadly speaking, there were four research sites for the ethnographic research that \nconstitutes this project. Alto Nangaritza, the re gion in and around the Shuar \u2018centro\u201921 of \n                                                        \n21 During the period from the 1960s in which claims for legal recognition of traditional land tenure began, \nShuar people have concentrated from their former pattern of dispersed occupation of the rainforest to \nsettlement in small towns, called \u2018centros\u2019, which became a base from which to push collective title to land. \nThe proces s was often facilitated by missionaries, who concentrated people around chapels and aided in \nlegalisation (see Rubenstein, 2001).  61 \n Shaime in Ecuador\u2019s most south -easterly \u2018cant\u00f3n\u2019 of Nangaritza, is treated as a whole.  I \nspent approximately four months living here, recording interviews and taking notes on \ndaily life that provided the backgroun d material to inform my analysis of what I was being \ntold by interviewees. As a site of political and social organisation for the entire region, \nShaime served as a base from which to interview whoever I could of the few hundred \npeople who lived in the town , its immediate vicinity and other settlements up to two full \ndays\u2019 walk into the forest. Alto Nangaritza, a region where Shuar people form a clear \ndemographic majority, was inaccessible by road before the Correa presidency and only had \nits indigenous land s legally recognised in the twenty -first century. Access to electricity is \nrare, mobile telecommunications are non -existent and most elderly people, especially \nwomen, do not speak Spanish. Middle -aged people tended to converse in the Shuar \nlanguage, but we re also proficient in Spanish.  \nAnother site, the small town of Kiim in the centre of Zamora -Chinchipe, is located just an \nhour and a half from the provincial capital, Zamora. Kiim was the first Shuar town where I \nwas able to stay when I began fieldwork in  2013, though research went on for only a \nfortnight before being interrupted by the need to attend to visa formalities in the \nEcuadorian capital.  The town, which is situated at the edge of a forest reserve, has all \nhouses connected to the electricity netw ork and many with satellite television. A further \ntwo \u2018centros\u2019 where interviews were carried out, Yanua and Churubia, are located just a \n40 minute walk from one another in the Quimi River Valley in the province\u2019s north -east. I \nspent approximately two mont hs living and researching in these two tiny, family towns in \n2014. Many of the interviewees here worked as wage labourers in the Mirador mine near \nthe top of the valley, a multi -billion -dollar Chinese -owned gold and copper project, while \nothers were fierce ly oppositional toward the presence of the mining company. It was in 62 \n this region that wage labour and integration into the market economy were most \nprevalent. As we shall see, the socio -cultural divergences of each of these locations had \nsignificant effect s upon the health -seeking preferences of research participants.  63 \n Figure 1: Iconographic map of the Ecuadorian province of Zamora -Chinchipe, \u00a9Sebastian \nGrant, 2016\n \n64 \n The process of seeking consent to live on Shuar land for extended periods and carry out \nrese arch varied from site to site, based on discussions in 2013 with the presidents of the \ntwo Shuar federations with affiliated communities in the province: the Shuar Federation \nof Zamora -Chinchipe (FSHZCH) and the Provincial Federation of the Shuar Nationali ty in \nZamora -Chinchipe (FEPNASH -ZCH). The former received my research proposal warmly and \nsaid that it would only be necessary to seek the approval of the \u2018s\u00edndico\u201922 in each \u2018centro\u2019 \nin which I would be staying. This was the process followed in Yanua and C hurubia in the \nQuimi Valley to the north of the province. For the president of FEPNASH -ZCH, the project \nwas an interesting one, but he considered it a lesser concern to defending land rights \nagainst potential gold and copper mining projects on affiliate co mmunities\u2019 territory. The \npresident hosted me for a short stay in his home \u2018centro\u2019 of Kiim, but said that consent to \nresearch in the federation\u2019s other communities in Alto Nangaritza would have to be sought \nin the communities themselves. Several months la ter, I was able to travel to Alto \nNangaritza accompanied by Shuar contacts with family in the region but who resided in \nthe city of Zamora; one of these men worked in the offices of the Pachakutik provincial \ngovernment, and the other with the now defunct P rovincial Directorate of Intercultural \nBilingual Education (DIPEIB -ZCH). These contacts facilitated my stay in Shaime until the \nnext \u2018centro\u2019 assembly, at which I presented the research project for approval and was \naccepted.  \nOn the interpersonal level of seeking out interviewees to share their stories of sickness \nand healing, the process was of course much more fluid. Many interviews happened \n                                                        \n22 Nominally, \u2018s\u00edndicos\u2019 are the elected leaders of Shuar \u2018centros,\u2019 although in smaller \u2018centros\u2019 composed of \na single extende d family network, the \u2018s\u00edndico\u2019 is almost always the eldest male proficient in Spanish.  65 \n thanks to friendships that developed little by little around the home environment, chicha23 \ndrinking sessions, games  of soccer and volleyball, communal \u2018barbasco\u201924 fishing days, \nafternoons spent hanging about bothering the Shaime shaman, or my efforts to \ncontribute to the seemingly endless amount of work to be done with a machete. Other \ninterviewees sought me out due to  their own curiosity, and would dive into lengthy \nanecdotes of their experiences with clinicians or shamans the moment I had finished \nexplaining the reason for my presence in Shuar country. Still others were strangers to me \nwhose homes I would visit accomp anied by a close Shuar friend in the \u2018centro\u2019, who would \nserve as a guarantor of my honesty and as occasional Spanish -Shuar translator when the \nneed arose for certain terms to be clarified, a very useful role when interviewing elder \npeople, as I was never able to progress beyond speaking the bare formalities in the Shuar \nlanguage and all interviews were thus conducted in Spanish. Neither interviewees nor \nfriends fulfilling this sort of \u2018research assistance\u2019 role were paid, although the small gifts I \ngave to  the families who fed and housed me no doubt contributed to the goodwill toward \nme in certain social circles.  \nThis emphasis on interviews and surveying several sites rather than immersing entirely in \na single one means that the present research project is in a sense sociological. Immanuel \nWallerstein comments that the fundamental initial division between anthropology and \nsociology was methodological, lying in the split between participant observation and \ninterviewing (1988: 528). Interviewing Shuar people o n their health -seeking practices, \n                                                        \n23 Amazonian chicha is made from fermented cassava mash.  \n24 \u2018Barbasco\u2019 (Shuar: masu ; Latin: Lonchocarpus urucu) is a plant whose poisonous roots are beaten with \nstones, placed into porous sacks and washed in small rivers by Shuar people in Alto Nangaritza in order to \nstun fish, which are then caught by hand as they float on the surface of the water and can evidently be \nsafely eaten.  66 \n rather than insisting exclusively on observing and drawing one\u2019s own conclusions about \nthe motivation and rationale for their behaviour, represents a small step toward \nnormalising the practice of taking indigenous people a t their word, just as sociologists \ntreat interviewees who they consider legitimate subjects in their own societies.  \nApplied to the Shuar context, the approach correlates neatly with the now -ingrained \nnotion that the capacity to speak Spanish and negotiate  with the outside world, including \nresearchers, is an essential (if predominately male) contemporary survival skill.25 In fact, \nthe process of carrying out formal interviews, and in particular the use of an audio \nrecorder, seemed to spur on Shuar men to dem onstrate their capacity for oratory and \nknowledge of and insights into various healing practices. In its reasonable approximation \nof traditional rules of masculine sociability (see Descola, 1996: 53), then, the interview \nprocess facilitated the collection of public statements on health -seeking preferences from \nmale heads of households; yet at the same time the success of this method found itself in \nperhaps too easy an aligment with a Shuar tradition in which the terrain of politics and the \npublic is a large ly masculine field. Ultimately, women accounted for 35 percent of the \ninterviewees, a situation less than ideal but, for a male researcher, difficult to avoid, and \nfortunately ameliorated by the effusiveness and insightfulness of several women who \nplayed a  significant role in shaping the Shuar perspective documented in Chapters 4, 5 and \n6.  \nInterviews were carried out in a semi -structured fashion. This allowed for Shuar people to \ndescribe health practices in their own terms, while also permitting a general stance on \n                                                        \n25 The prestige now attached to the cap acity to engage with outside world has been traced to the initiation \nof the Amazon colonisation policies promoted by the Ecuadorian state in the 1960s, which made \ndevelopment lending available in exchange for pursuing productive activities recognised by th e state, \npredominately cattle -raising (Hendricks, 1988: 234 -5). 67 \n each kind of health practice found in Shuar territory in Zamora -Chinchipe province to be \ndelineated. The element of \u2018structure\u2019 in the interviews was to ask the interviewee, at \nmoments where the conversation stalls, whether they make use of clini cal medicine, \nshamanic healing, medicinal plants and hallucinogenic plants. The latter, which in Shuar \ntraditional practice include tobacco (Sp.: \u2018tabaco\u2019; Shuar: tsaank ;26 Latin: nicotiana rustica), \ndatura (Sp.: \u2018guantu\u2019, \u2018to\u00e9\u2019 or \u2018floripondio\u2019; Shuar: maikiua ; Latin: Brugmansia spp.) and \nayahuasca are often mentioned in answer to questions about medicinal plants, but \ninterviewees were prompted to offer an opinion on their use if they were not. These \nplants\u2019 capacity to provoke both physiological and psycho logical responses converts them \ninto key analytical devices for revealing where individuals locate the site of illnesses\u2019 \norigins and resolution (see Chapter 5).  \nThe clinics at which Shuar people in the research communities were able to seek medical \ntreatm ent are simple, principally offering analgesics, vaccinations, anti -venom and \ntreatments for respiratory infections and diarrhoea. For Shuar residents of Kiim, Yanua or \nChurubia, however, these clinics supplemented regional hospitals in Yantzaza, Zamora an d \nGualaquiza, which even by bus could be accessed in less than two hours. In Alto \nNangaritza, by contrast, hospital care was some seven hours away in the best of cases, and \nthat only for residents of Shaime with close access to the one road out of the regi on. The \nclinic in Shaime was open two days a week; the doctors spent another two days of the \nweek at a mestizo town several hours away and left around midday on Friday to return to \ntheir homes in the highlands for the weekend. Clinicians\u2019 relationship with  Shuar people \nwas also mixed. One doctor reported having purchased a motorised canoe to facilitate his \n                                                        \n26 A note on formatting: Shuar words are written in italics; Spanish words, aside from the well -known ones \n(e.g. mestizo) are written in quotation marks.  68 \n journey between the two Alto Nangaritza clinics, only to have it stolen shortly thereafter. \nFor their part, many Shuar people in this region saw doctors as the agents of genocidal \nconspiracies to poison or sterilise Shuar people with sedative drugs (see Chapter 3). Even \nso, as the following chapter illustrates, there was a high degree of pragmatism in Shuar \npeople\u2019s attitudes to the offerings of state medi cal clinics, which are, after all, available \nfree of charge.  \n \nBorder Thinking and Coloniality  \nThe clearest methodological precedent to the present research project is Walter Mignolo\u2019s \n\u2018border thinking,\u2019 which begins with the demand to \u2018unravel the geopoli tics of knowledge \nfrom the perspective of coloniality\u2019 (Mignolo, 2005a: x -xi). Coloniality has been variously \ninterpreted. Of the prominent theorists, An\u00edbal Quijano stresses race and white supremacy \n(2008 ), Mignolo emphasises \u2018the trap of modernity\u2019 defined as the unending drive toward \nmaterial progress (2000 ), and Eduardo Galeano focuses on economic neo-colonialism \n(1997: 205ff .). I take \u2018the perspective of coloniality\u2019 to mean the awareness of the legacy \nof colonialism despite its formal end. A white person in the Andes is constantly faced with \nwhite supremacy on an everyday, mundane level; as when entering a store and not being \nrequired to leave one\u2019s bag with security guards as everyone else must. Silvia Rivera \nCusicanqui offers a painful example of the other side of the coin \u2013the indigenous \nexperience of white supremacy\u2019s influence on land ownership in Bolivia \u2013in this quotation \nfrom a prominent land -holder:  \nTo rip these lands from the hands of the indigenous [people], ignorant, backwards,  \nwithout means, capacity or will to cultivate, and to transfer them to the  69 \n entrepreneurial, active and intelligent white race, avid for properti es, is in reality the  \nhealthiest transformation of the social and economic reality of Bolivia (1986 : 26).  \nCountering coloniality animates the geopolitics of knowledge critique of the ruling \nrelations structuring state healthcare in Latin America: the epistemology of medical \nscience, the pharmaceutical industry, industrial medicines, bioprospecting and p atent law. \nThe colonial legacy continues to be evident in this domain, as much in the aesthetics as in \nthe prevalence of the use of biomedicine in Latin America. In the North Atlantic world, \nthese same assumptions of white superiority have buttressed econo mic opportunism \nunder the cover of \u2018improving upon\u2019 indigenous medicines. This epistemic arrogance is \nbest understood genealogically through its development in the colonial encounter. As \nLinda Alcoff argues, the epistemological authoritarianism fundamental  to the theological \nreason that initially justified the conquest of the Americas had to be maintained even \nbeyond the Enlightenment critiques of theology, \u2018or else the colonial masters would have \nno claim to epistemic supremacy\u2019 (2007: 96 ). So, Alcoff argues:  \n[E]pistemic credibility is associated with identity, and sometimes determined by it. [\u2026] Thus, \nidentity -based assessments were integrated into epistemic practice as well as into \nepistemologies t hat justified favouring certain groups over others with a measure of \npresumptive credibility (2007: 82).  \nOr, as Santiago Castro -G\u00f3mez puts it, \u2018the idea [is] that the coloniser possesses an ethnic \nand cognitive superiority over the colonised\u2019 (2007: 428). As we have seen, Alcoff\u2019s \nobservations resonate with the global governance of traditional medicine; and as we shall \nsee, they are also clearly evident in the legal and scientific regimes that structure \npharmaceutical bioprospecting.  70 \n Border thinking is the  move into the space created by the geopolitics of knowledge \ncritique.  As Alcoff writes, \u2018double positionality is key to the border\u2019s epistemic resources. \nIf the subaltern simply champions what the West has disparaged, there is a risk that what \nis being ch ampioned is a western construct\u2019 (2007: 94 ). Likewise, Ram\u00f3n Grosfoguel (2011) \nmakes pointedly clear in his own enunciation of decolonial theory that the worst mistake \nis \u2018to invert the binary\u2019; in other words, to reject all things white following the \ncondemnation of coloniality and white supremacy. Once we have created this space, then, \nas Alcoff writes, \u2018[t]he overall effect of this is something like taking a practical knowledge \napproach to epistem ology itself, with a concern for the who and the how as much as the \nwhat\u2019 (2007: 97 ). The ultimate goal is \u2018the possibility of localised accounts of best epistemic \npractices\u2019 (2007: 97 ). What Alcoff describes here is a general, theoretical account of what \nI envision the methods employed in this project realising in one specific case by combining \nthe broad scope of interview locations with epis temic critique of hegemonic knowledge; \nor, as Alcoff puts it, \u2018de -subalternizing knowledge itself [by] getting at the mechanisms by \nwhich [some] knowledges are constructed as non -knowledges and [others] are \nconstructed as absolute\u2019 (2007: 94).  \nAllowing sp ace for multiple \u2018epistemic practices\u2019 can be conceived of as pointing at the \nsame object from different positions. One can advocate for this position on utilitarian \ngrounds as well as on the grounds of decolonial justice. Maori philosopher Anulani Me yer \ndescribes indigenous knowledge as a \u2018knowledge system prioritised by the needs of \npeople and the lessons of place\u2019 (2013: 94 ). In other words, we are talking about historically \ndeveloped bodies of knowledge that make full use of the resources at hand. Medicinal \nplants that are known and used by \u2018ecosystem people\u2019 (Nix on, 2011: 22), whose survival \nhas for countless generations depended upon such knowledge of their immediate 71 \n environment, can be assumed to be safe and are highly likely to be effective for their stated \npurpose. The few research projects on indigenous medic inal plants that have been carried \nout have borne out this result (Berlin, 1976; Lewis, 2003), with 75 -85 percent of plants \nconfirmed (to the best of the abilities of medical science researchers) as functioning as \nclaimed by indigenous informants (Mgbeoji,  2006: 142). In the specific case of Amazonian \nindigenous medicinal knowledge, what is known of this system suggests a high degree of \nsophistication. Ar\u00e9valo (1994) and Schultes (Raffauf, 1990) attest to very high degree of \ndifferentiation between plants a nd understanding of the effects of micro -climatic \nconditions on medicinal plants\u2019 efficacy. It has been suggested that some indigenous \nhealers demonstrate a greater differentiation between plants than the western system of \nbotanical classification (Ald erete, 2005: 79). Indigenous Amazonia\u2019s rich pharmacopeia \nand unique practices of shamanism suggest that just like western medicine, Amazonian \nmedicine is likely to be reaching truths about healing that other knowledge systems do not \napproach. As such, we are  not relying on \u2018a nostalgic or romantic cast\u2019 over indigenous \nknowledge here, but simply respecting the strength of \u2018the indigenous [\u2026] as a synonym \nfor that which has endured\u2019 (Meyer, 2013: 98 ).  \nBorder th inking is a particularly apt label and stimulating concept, but it is not blazing an \nentirely new trail. Numerous projects centre on the critique of western intellectual edifices \nand their social correlates in order to open space for either their reformula tion or for the \nfacilitation of indigenous creativity that demands decolonisation as a first step. These \ncritical research projects have been helpfully characterised as \u2018critical emancipation -driven \nresearch,\u2019 whose defining feature is that \u02bb[t]he wider co ntext of which the relevant \nempirical material is a part cannot be mapped out in a concrete empirical study \u02bc (Alvesson \n& Sk\u00f6ldberg, 2009: 284 ). One of the most eminent examples of \u2018critical emancipation -72 \n driven research\u2019 is the research program led by Charles R. Hale (2011 ). Hale has previously \nadvocated wha t he calls \u2018cultural critique\u2019 (2006) as part of historicising government \nclaims over national territory and thereby legitimising indigenous land rights claims. \n\u2018Activist research methods,\u2019 he writes, \u2018ask that we give priority to the research products \nthat the struggle in question requires, which in turn requires judicious use of our well -\nhoned tools of deconstruction and cultural critique\u2019 (2011: 187 ).  \nInterculturality is certainly a heated and rhetorically charged political cause, though \nintercultural health tends to be  less prominent than campaigns for bilingual, intercultural \neducation and for \u2018justicia ind\u00edgena\u2019 (indigenous justice).27 Intercultural health has been \nclaimed as part of the political program of Pachakutik parliamentarian Luis Macas (2000: \n105), the Kichwa federation ECUARUNARI (ECUARUNARI -CONAIE, 2007 ), the Ecuadorian \nnational indigenous confederation CONAIE (2007a ), the former President of the national \nindigenous Amazonian federation CONFENIAE, Franco Viteri, and Diego Chumapi, \nPresident of the Shuar Federation of Zamora -Chinchipe (FSHZCH). Nonetheless, the \nresea rch design as I have proposed it should prevent the work from being compromised \nby the political heat of the topic, as it will certainly not involve the mute acceptance of \u2018the \nindigenous wisdom trope\u2019 or the assertion of a stark divide between \u2018western\u2019 a nd \n\u2018indigenous\u2019 culture.  \n \n \n                                                        \n27 This refers to the right claimed by i ndigenous communities to deal with criminals in their own way, \nwithout being obliged to involve the police, national courts or penal system. See Santos & Grijalva Jim\u00e9nez \n(2012).  73 \n Interculturality, Critical Epistemology and the Non -Indigenous Anthropologist  \nThere is a contradiction in the role of the anthropologist: living amongst people of a \ndifferent culture for long periods of time and listening earnest ly and respectfully to any \ninformation offered, one is then expected to return to academia and produce rational \norder from cultural chaos. There is a certain schizophrenia in this mix of credulity and \ncritical analysis, a position vividly portrayed by Mich ael Taussig (1987: 141 ) and revealed in \na common ambiguity of commitment to the truth of what is being portrayed in \nethnographic monographs. An account of a shamanic s\u00e9ance, for example, may read, \u2018The \nshaman transformed himself into a tiger, disappeared into the ether and conq uered the \nvengeful spirit plaguing his patient.\u2019 In such cases, there is an implied but equivocal \nqualification \u2013\u2018My research subjects believe that \u2026\u2019 \u2013and an even less clear but often \npresent dismissal \u2013\u2018\u2026and they are deluded.\u2019 This is especially evident for  anthropologists \nwho experience events that they cannot rationalise (e.g. Fotiou, 2010). Bruce Grindal, an \nanthropologist who wrote an account of seeing a corpse become animated and begin to \ndrum and dance during a ritual in Ghana (1983: 68), subsequently reported being warned \nconcerning any further departures from \u2018respectable anthropology\u2019 (Marton, 2004: 19). \nHow is it, then, that one should approach interviewees\u2019 accounts of a healing practice that \nincludes cleansing by shamans and herbalists and reserve s a central place for visionary \nexperiences under the influence of hallucinogenic plants?   \nRichard Rorty offers a possible response: \u2018We Western liberal intellectuals should accept \nthe fact that we have to start from where we are, and that this means that  there are lots \nof views which we simply cannot take seriously\u2019 (1991: 29 ). In an intriguing twist for my \npurposes here, the \u2018views\u2019 \u2013presumably including cosmologies, ontologies and 74 \n epistemologies \u2013that Rorty exhor ts us to summarily dismiss in the name of good sense are \nthose belonging to \u2018Nazis and Amazonians\u2019 (1991: 31 ). The degree to which anthropologists \nare actually willing to \u2018take seriously\u2019 all the implications of t he worldview of their \ninformants is questionable, and yet at least at the explicit level most would decry the \nposition put forward by Rorty. In citing Rorty\u2019s comments, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro \nargues that \u2018[e]ach word of his admonition converges to a pe rfect anti -definition of \nanthropology\u2019 (2011: 131 ). Thus, particularly in medical anthropology, when writing about \nshamans, s\u00e9ances and spirit flight anthropologists are caught between taking seriously \nand being taken seriously. As such, the modus operandi has become to avoid firm \ncommitments and instead directly report the understanding of the world held by \u2018the \npeople themselves,\u2019 following the example of the \u2018interpretive social science\u2019 of Paul \nRabinow and William Sullivan (1987). In fact, Viveiros de Castro himself has been taken to \ntask for his repre sentational interference in Amazonian worldviews by Alcida Ramos, who \ncriticises his well -known theory of \u2018multinatural perspectivism\u2019 (Viveiros de Castro, 1998 ) \nas \u2018flattening,\u2019 arguing that \u2018there is no reason why we should expect indigenous people \nto behave according to this or that academic model \u2019 (2012: 183 ). She also provides ample \nsupport for those who would read her own position as an abdication of the role of the \nwestern anthropologist as the logical conclusion of privileging the views of \u2018the people \nthemselves\u2019. \u2018It is high time,\u2019 Ramos argues, \u2018[that] we evaluate disengage ment as the \nultimate result of engagement, as indigenous peoples progressively occupy political and \nacademic spaces\u2019 (2012: 490 ). I was reminded of the impeccable end -product that can be \ncreated by indigenous anthrop ologists documenting aspects of their own cultures by \nLuperio Mamani\u2019s (2013) \u2018Medicina Tradicional Aimara\u2019. What better example of Ramos\u2019 \ninvocation to \u2018 extinguish the ventriloquist and make room for the voices of the Indians 75 \n themselves\u2019 (2012: 490 ). If the role of the anthropologist is simply to convey the \nknowledge of the people themselves, what is the place of a white  researcher  based in a \nwealthy nation -state like Australi a?28 This predicament was made all the more stark by \nvirtue of having had no direct experience with Shuar people, language and culture before \ntravelling to Shuar territory in early 2013. Why should I be striving to learn about and \ncommunicate Shuar knowledge when they could do so effectively themselves? And to \nwhat end should this cosmopolitan privilege to cross national borders and cultural spaces \nbe directed?  \nInterculturality is what brings value to the non -indigenous anthropologist\u2019s position.29 The \nwestern anthropologist combines sympathy with the lived experiences and the \nknowle dge systems of indigenous peoples with her/his comprehension of the colonial \nlegacy of social and epistemological institutions that have served to marginalise and \ndisparage indigenous peoples. Bruno Latour (2010) describes the tightrope act as avoiding \nboth Kuhn\u2019s \u2018normal science\u2019 (Kuhn, 2012: 24 )\u2013where all data is considered in light of \nexisting scientific theories \u2013and \u2018going native\u2019 to such an extent that one is unable in one\u2019s \nwriting to make connections with the politics and worldview of one\u2019s readers. The \nobjective, therefore, is to comprehend  indigenous culture and knowledge in the \ncompromised way inevitable to the efforts of most outsiders, but to at the same time take \nadvantage of a privileged insight into the barriers to engagement with and support for \nindigenous culture and knowledge place d by the western world. Faced with western \n                                                        \n28 This rhetorical invocation of my own positioning as comparable to that of o ther white researchers based \nin we althy countries should  be nuanced by the recognition of the peculiar place that Australia occupies in \nthe historically generated world -system and geopolitically as a \u2018rich, semiperipheral\u2019 (Connell, 2007) settler -\ncolonial nation founded on state violence toward Aboriginal peoples that proceeds to this day. See also the \nwork of Irene Watson (2007) and Aileen Moreton -Robinson (2007).  \n29 This is not to preclude indigenous anthropologists from carrying out intercultural research  in the same \nfashion.   76 \n epistemic hegemony, we must pluralise the ways we produce truth; and faced with a \nparadigm that exclusively values expert episteme , we must open dialogue with the doxa \nof oppressed peoples (Alcoff, 2007: 96 ). And to do that, one must abandon the \naforementioned ambiguous commitment to what is being recounted in ethnographic \nwriting, and instead look to the experiences of people living in the intercultural \nborderlands,  where distinct philosophies and their concomitant material manifestations \nmeet, as they go about combining practices pragmatically so as to satisfy their everyday \nneeds to survive and to prosper.  \nSuch an approach draws not only on the theoretical and met hodological architecture \nconstructed by decolonial thinkers in and from Latin America, but also the genealogical \ndiscourse analysis practised by the likes of Edward Said and Michel Foucault. Indeed, the \ntwo streams of intellectual analysis tend to overlap,  as evidenced in \u00c1rturo Escobar\u2019s \n(1995) The Making and the Unmaking of the Third World . This is not a coalition founded on \nshared \u2018post -modern\u2019 affinities for textual play or abdication of the role of the author in \nconstructing truth. Rather, the spirit o f work to be adopted is that of researchers whose \nmeticulously research historicism generated the currently de rigueur skepticism \nsurrounding western meta -narratives. Escobar\u2019s \u2018post -structuralist\u2019 conclusions regarding \ndevelopment agencies, for example, g rew out of close historical analysis, demonstrating \ninternational agencies\u2019 focus on nutrition as a substitute for addressing political realities \n(1995: 115 ) and on economic policies putatively designed to aid \u2018the peasants\u2019 which in fact \nremoved most of them  from existence by generating mass urban migration (1995: 137 ). \nSaid\u2019s analyses of colonialism and Foucault\u2019s of the disciplinary regimes characteristic of \nmodernity likewise pay close attention to historical evidence rather than relying on a priori 77 \n dismissal s of dualisms, essentialisms, categories and classifications. It is to this geopolitics \nof knowledge critique that we now turn.  \nThe ontological basis of western medicine is fundamentally defined by the position that \nreality is knowable solely through its own epistemology. All valid truth claims must emerge \nfrom this predominant epistemology. At the same time, however, despite assumptions of \nepistemic neutrality and universalism, this epistemology is actualised in best practices for \nclinical research that a re immersed in a political -economic milieu and figured in the \nlanguage of a cultural -historic experience that colours research design and the \ncommunication and application of results. In short, biomedical science claims sole \nepistemic jurisdiction over pub lic health despite resting on culturally peculiar variables that \nhave no necessary authority to monopolise knowledge of healing. To quote the Dalai \nLama, \u2018[t]he problem is not with the empirical data of science but with the idea that these \ndata alone const itute the legitimate ground for developing a comprehensive worldview\u2019 \n(Meyer, 2013: 98). Intercultural health cannot exist within this order: rather, \u2018culture\u2019 can \nonly enter the frame as a deviation from the norm, a crude interpretation of group \npsycholog y which helps explain \u2018non -compliance\u2019 and which is to be adapted to through \n\u2018cultural competence\u2019 initiatives.  \nAn example will aid in grounding these assertions. On 1 July, 2012, the Australian Federal \nGovernment introduced mandatory registration for practitioners of Traditional Chinese \nmedicine (TCM). Registration required satisfaction of standards for English -language \nproficiency, insurance against litigation and certification according to knowledge of TCM \nas set out by the Chinese Medicine Board of Australia. These seemingly common -sense \nmeasures were criticised by doctors as \u2018a dangerous endorsement of unproven 78 \n treatments\u2019 and \u2018giving tacit government support to a field that was not supported by \nscientific evidence gained through rigorously controlled clinical trials\u2019 (Robotham, 2012). \nProfessor Jersman, a respiratory specialist, argued, \u2018If research is conducted  that shows it \nworks, we\u2019d welcome that. [\u2026] Where is the evidence people haven\u2019t died? We want \ncertainty whether it works or not\u2019 (Robotham, 2012). Such comments clearly demonstrate \nthe presumed position of epistemological authority assumed by biomedical science. The \nkey here is not to advocate for TCM in resistance to biomedicine, but rather, standing \nbetween the two, to move via critique to a more appropriate epistemology. As posited by \nthe Ecuadorian intercultural university Amawtay Wasi, \u2018the goal is t o attain the capacity to \nsynthesise in dialogue between knowledges\u2019 (Llanes Ortiz, 2005: 201). This demands a \nreflexivity that is absent from much of biomedical science, including studies of traditional \nmedicine that adopt medical science\u2019s hegemonic stand point. A Canadian TCM \npractitioner observed the following regarding a biomedical study that sought to assess the \nvalidity of TCM:  \nThey didn't get the differential diagnosis. That's the core of Chinese medicine, which means \nthat every person gets treated f or the reasons they got cancer, and the reason they have their \nsymptoms might be completely different than the guy next to them. So it will never be \npractised that way. You can't give the same formula to 200 people, you cannot. Now you've \nbroken Chinese me dicine. It's not Chinese medicine anymore, it's a Western study using \nChinese herbs (Hollenberg & Muzzin, 2010: 46).  \nApplying such a research methodology to the study of non -western healing practice is \nsuggestive of an epistemological arrogance according t o which biomedical science has \nnothing to learn from the conceptualisation of health, illness and medicine in non -western \nhealth -seeking practices. The present research project looks instead to the more 79 \n productive approach of drawing upon the core insights  of one knowledge system to \ninform the practices of the other. Such insights include the concept of \u2018the differential \ndiagnosis,\u2019 which mirrors Georges Canguilhem\u2019s concern with the influence of normativity \nin medical science (Gane, 1998). A further point,  to be explored subsequently, is that of \nchemical synergies, which has informed Chinese researchers in medical science (Yan et al., \n2012: 5). It is this intercultural standpoint between knowledge systems that represents an \nepistemology that is appropriate for ethnography on the borders of the western political -\neconomic system, and the critique of western epistemic hegemony is essential for the \nmaintenance of this space. For this reason, we will now move into a case study of \npharmaceutical bioprospecting in the Peruvian Amazon, which functions both as a critique \nof biomedical epistemology as well as of the ruling relations which sustain its position of \nepistemic hegemony.  \n \nPharmaceutical Bioprospecting and the Epistemological Encounter  \nThe International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups (ICBG) program, directed by the US \nNational Institute of Health, National Science Foundation and the US Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID), was dedicated to exploring the potential \npharmaceutical applications of medicinal plants and other so -called biological resources. \nAs discussed in Chapter 1, the program featured two research projects in which the \nselection of plants to be assessed by pharmaceutical companies was carried out by Latin \nAmerican i ndigenous groups. One of these was the ICBG Aguaruna (also known as ICBG \nPeru), named after the Aguaruna people of the north -west Peruvian Amazon with whom 80 \n researchers collaborated.30 This process followed numerous suggestions from \nethnobotanists that such a research design would improve bioprospecting by focusing on \nthe most relevant medicinal plants in any area (Balick, 1990; Cox, 1990; King, 1992), with an \nawareness of the fact that even synthetically produced pharmaceuticals are often \noriginally inspired  by the structures of naturally occurring molecules (Thiel, 2000). Unlike \nthe ICBG Maya, the ICBG Aguaruna was carried through to a successful conclusion, at least \naccording to its own objectives; the ICBG initiative\u2019s stated aims were medical research, \nconservation of biodiversity and sustainable development (NIH, 2002: 10 -11; Rosenthal, \n2006: 119). As a standard -bearer for responsible bioprospecting, the program was run with \nmuch greater intention to benefit local people \u2013in terms of both compensation paym ents \nfor local knowledge as well as through research into local diseases \u2013than would typically \nbe found in private -sector bioprospecting. As such, it presents an example of what success \nmeans within the parameters of biomedical research on indigenous healin g knowledge \nand practice.  \nThe research team of the ICBG Aguaruna project managed to reach a legal agreement with \n\u2018the Aguaruna\u2019 which permitted them to collect samples of medicinal plants. These plants \nwere identified by Aguaruna based on their knowledge of the plants\u2019 uses. The project\u2019s \npartner corporation, Searle (then part of Monsanto and now part of Pfizer), paid \u2018the \nAguaruna people\u2019 a know -how licence for the right to make use of their collective \nintellectual property (Greene, 2004: 218). The resear chers paid a sum per sample and \nagreed that a proportion of the earnings of any commercially developed pharmaceutical \nwould be paid to \u2018the Aguaruna people\u2019 (Lewis & Ramani, 2007: 405). Samples of medicinal \n                                                        \n30 The other was the aforementioned ICBG Maya (see Berlin & Berlin, 2004; Nigh, 2002).  81 \n plants were shipped to the United States to be an alysed by Searle (Greene, 2004: 223) and, \nafter Searle\u2019s withdrawal from the project, to the researchers based at Washington \nUniversity in St. Louis, Missouri (Greene, 2004: 219).  \nYet beneath the language of best practices, the ICBG Aguaruna fomented signi ficant \npolitical divisions among Aguaruna people. The researchers\u2019 initial discussions about the \nproject were carried out with the \u2018Consejo Aguaruna -Huambisa\u2019 (CAH \u2013Aguaruna -\nHuambisa Council). According to anthropologist Shane Greene (2004: 215), CAH was \n\u2018clearly the most prominent institutional actor among the Aguaruna\u2019 and \u2018a federation of \nmuch more influence historically\u2019 than the other representative body considered for \nengagement by researchers, the \u2018Organizaci\u00f3n Central de Comunidades Aguarunas del \nAlto Mara\u00f1on\u2019 (OCCAAM \u2013Central Organisation of the Aguaruna Communities of the Upper \nMara\u00f1on). However, after disagreements on the degree of legal protection that would be \ngranted to the Aguaruna, the researchers stopped meeting with CAH. Eighteen months \nafter  their original meeting with CAH, the ICBG team signed a detailed contract with \nOCCAAM (Greene, 2004: 217). During this time, CAH became more and more outspoken in \nits opposition to the project, describing OCCAAM as a phantasm: no more than an \ninvention of  the research team (Greene, 2004: 216). This is clearly a politically motivated \ncritique, yet its grain of truth is that no more than forty percent of the Aguaruna \npopulation were affiliated with OCCAAM; and that deceptively, these people were defined \nas \u2018the Aguaruna people\u2019 in the legal agreement that allowed the ICBG Aguaruna to \nproceed (Greene, 2004: 219). Given that the project has not discovered a chemical \nprecursor for a profitable pharmaceutical product, the compensation ultimately paid to \nAguaruna communities via OCCAAM has been small. Nonetheless it is easy to picture the 82 \n political crisis that would have eventuated among Aguaruna people had large sums of \nroyalties been distributed to only those communities affiliated with OCCAAM.  \nThis aspect of the  story is one of power corrupting: the well -resourced research team \nappeared willing to act divisively in Aguaruna communities in order to secure the best \ncommercial deal for itself. However, to continue with the epistemological critique the \nanalysis must be focused on the nature of the pharmaceutical research itself. In fact, this \ninsistence on foisiting North American legal and regulatory structures upon a politically \nand economically marginalised indigenous federation is less surprising than the degree t o \nwhich elements of procedural rationalisation characteristic of capitalist modernity skewed \nthe methodology of this putatively cross -cultural research project. Specifically, the \npresuppositions of biomedical science, particularly the form it adopts throug h its \napplication via the pharmaceutical industry, was the only theoretical system of medicine \nand healing around which the ICBG Aguaruna\u2019s research was oriented. This is despite the \nproject being, ostensibly, research about indigenous medicinal knowledge,  which would \nimply an approach open to the prospect of encountering different healing methodologies. \nThe ICBG initiative screen all plant samples for single -molecule active ingredients by \nbioassay machines (Hayden, 2003: 72). According to George Albers -Sch\u00f6nberg, formerly a \nchemist with the pharmaceutical corporation Merck, these bioassay machines can only \nscan botanical samples for pre -specified chemical substances. The desired chemical \nstructure is chosen based on biochemical pathways already known to aid  in the treatment \nor cure of a disease (1995: 73), such that ethnomedical information can only be used to \nhelp guide the decision of what chemical structure to have the bioassay machines scan for. \nAny pharmaceutical bioprospecting project carried out in th is way is, by design, blind to \nthe potential synergistic effects between chemical components of an indigenous 83 \n medicine, as well as to the possibility of completely new biochemical pathways being \nactivated by the treatment methods. The orientation of the co mmercial agreements \naround the objective of developing a patent on a single -molecular chemical entity and the \nexecutive political authority that was required to be able to enter into intellectual property \ncontracts were both instrumentalisations of the kno wledge system of medical science and \nthe pharmaceutical industry.  \nA medicine is not by definition a single -molecular entity. While this is scientifically accepted \n(e.g. Li & Zhang, 2009), the notion of single -molecule active ingredients remains an \noperatio nal assumption of Western medicine, a fact which starkly illustrates the distinction \nbetween science as a theoretical ideal and science as a social practice. As a further example \nof this distinction, medical science tends to be prejudiced against research that fails to \nelucidate the specific chemical pathways of a medicine\u2019s bioactivity, even where the \neffectiveness of a treatment is unquestioned (Swanson, 1995: 11). This delimitation of the \nfocus of biomedical science can only be attributed to a complex we b of social and historical \nfactors. Primary amongst those, however, must be the insinuation of the motives of \nindustrial mass -production into all productive activity, including scientific inquiry. As Evelyn \nFox Keller writes in her study of the discipline of molecular biology:  \n[T]he kind of theory that would provide a workable guide for such a project [what she later \nterms \u2018the interventional capability\u2019 (1995: 64)] is precisely a theory that focuses on the causal \nrelations between identifiable and controll able agents. Other processes, less identifiable and \nless controllable, are bracketed in the name of intellectual economy and technological \nefficacy. In this way, the very meaning of knowledge \u2013what counts as knowledge \u2013is shaped \nby a tacit instrumental manda te (1995: 63).  84 \n In the context of industrial pharmacy, what this means is that it has become an ingrained \nand unconscious \u2013as opposed to an empirically researched and consciously decided \u2013\nperspective that a medicine must be an isolated chemical entity, capabl e of being patented \nas a unique invention and mass -produced industrially. Medical epistemology has not \ndeveloped via an assessment of the logic of mass -producing single -entity chemicals, which \nmay then be stored for lengthy periods and dispensed quickly in  the brief consultations \nwith patients characteristic of mass societies; as against disadvantages such as the more \nsevere side effects that many be provoked by single -entity medicines, or potential \nlimitations in biological efficacy on the sick patient in comparison with other kinds of \nmedicines. Instead, these epistemological assumptions that have developed during a \nspecific socio -historical experience have become insinuated into the very meaning of what \nis and what is not a legitimate medicine. The episte mological consequences of the legal \nand regulatory structures of industrial political economy are but one example of the \ninevitable cultural specificities that will inhere in the development of any knowledge \nsystem.31 \nSuch cases of epistemological inflexibi lity have the capacity to significantly hamper cross -\ncultural research projects, as the unfolding of the ICBG Aguaruna suggests. In bioassays of \nthe extract of a particular medicinal plant, one of its chemical constituents was found to \nhave antimalarial ac tivity at a rate of 78 percent and another at 60 percent. However, \naccording to ICBG Aguaruna project leader Walter Lewis, \u2018when the two were combined \n                                                        \n31 In the modern period in Europe and North America, other prominent examples are the peculiar obsession \nof the nineteenth -century European learned  classes with the putatively contaminating qualities of the \nindustrial working -class (Barnes, 2006); the impact of nationalism and eugenics on theories of bacteriology \nand immunity (Martin, 1994); and the interplay of the notions of race and hygiene in the  colonies of the \nNorth -Atlantic powers (Anderson, 2006).  85 \n in the proportions in which they are naturally found in the medicinal plant's bark, a rate of \n90 percent inhibition was demonstrated\u2019 (Lewis, 2003: 129). This is unsurprising in light of \nthe \u2018shared sensitivities\u2019 between humans and plants to a range of pathogens (Lewis, \n2003: 130), which implies that the medicinal compounds developed by plants for their own \nsurvival are in many cases needed for the very same purpose by human beings. \nNonetheless, the medicine -as-single -molecule -entity assumption means that the FDA \nrequires that all new medicines be isolated chemical entities. If not \u2013as in the case of non -\nlabor atory generated plant extracts, which inevitably contain a mixture of components \u2013\neach chemical entity in the mixture must be isolated and tested individually for safety and \nefficacy in order to justify its presence in the medicine (Khalil, 1995: 239). The potential of \nsynergistic action is thereby discounted from the beginning, as plant extracts are not \ntested for efficacy in their original form.  \nBeyond this absence of epistemological dialogue, the subordination of Aguaruna \nknowledge was even clearer in th e business model followed by Searle. The plant samples \ncollected by the Aguaruna and transferred to Searle were analysed through bioassay \nmachines, with the information collected by the ICBG researchers on the uses of each \nsample in Aguaruna healing actual ly being discarded and considered irrelevant. Searle \nchose to instead scan the samples for chemical substances known to be active against \ndiabetes, cardiovascular problems and inflammatory diseases (Greene, 2004: 219). This \nwas clearly a strategy motivated  by the profitability of marketing drugs to patients \nsuffering from these conditions in the global North, a commercial strategy made all the \nmore unsavoury by the status of these diseases as to a significant extent diseases of \naffluence. Any potential bioa ctivity of the plant samples against other health problems \nwere rendered irrelevant by this decision. As a final touch, Monsanto (Searle\u2019s parent 86 \n company at that time) included a report on the project as part of its \u2018Report on Sustainable \nDevelopment\u2019, in which it painted its involvement as a benevolent initiative for the \nbetterment of rainforest conservation and indigenous peoples (Monsanto, 1998: 28). Even \nin a supposedly collaborative research project, the depth of ingrained, colonial arrogance \nwas such that the Aguaruna could be painted as benefiting enormously from the simple \npurchase of a cache of plant samples by a multinational corporation.  \nIn sum, the ICBG Aguaruna illustrates that globally hegemonic ruling relations act at the \nlegal, commercial, te chnical and epistemological level to reduce the products of \nindigenous knowledge systems to the level of raw materials, \u2018genetic resources\u2019 \nsupposedly devoid of value until unlocked by modern innovation. The legal status of \nintellectual property is granted  readily to pharmaceutical corporations, even for the most \nminor of changes to a product\u2019s chemical structure (Mgbeoji, 2006: 148), while indigenous \nknowledge of the medicinal use of a plant is rarely recognised by the same laws of \ninnovation.32 The absence  of the affective indicators of high technology in indigenous \nsocieties tends to leave their knowledge unrecognised, such that the possibilities of \nindigenous input towards hybrid processes of knowledge formation are unrealised. Ikechi \nMgbeoji has expounde d upon this structure of epistemological subordination:  \n[T]he articulation of what constitutes invention in the dominant narrative of science weaves \nan implausible novelty into knowledge that is already well -known to traditional peoples. \nAccordingly, the p atent system [...] is in fact speaking a monologue directed towards a narrow \nepistemological and economic elite. In this strange but familiar world, marginalised \n                                                        \n32 In the case of maca (Latin: Lepidium meyenii), a plant native to the northern Peruvian Andes, a patent \nwas granted to a North American company for a simple ethanol extract of the plant, a method k nown and \nused in traditional medicine in countless locations worldwide (del Castillo, 2004: 27).  87 \n epistemological frameworks take on the status of stunned spectators/victims. The \nexclusiveness  of Western scientific jargon as an elite cultural signifier, along with Western \njuridical formalism itself (which has been globally positioned as the only legitimate and \nacceptable narrative framework of science), serves to appropriate indigenous knowledg e and \nmarginalise indigenous cultures (2006: 149).   \nThe point here is not to produce a version of the class -conflict dialectic by demanding for \nindigenous peoples a greater share in the spoils of a capitalist economy dominated by alien \nepistemic assumption s to their own, as have the more polemical opponents of \u2018biopiracy \u2019 \n(e.g. Mooney, 2000). This case study of the ICBG Aguaruna goes further, pointing to the \nmanner in which western countries\u2019 narrowly defined, industrial -era emphasis on \nproductive efficienc y has infilitrated the social being of science itself, to the extent that it \nmay profoundly alter what could be discovered and added into scientific theories that are \npresented as elevated, neutral and objective. This conclusion is echoed in the work of \nSienna Craig (2011), whose research shows that policy initiatives to develop the Tibetan \ntraditional medicine industry according to standards of cleanliness, purity, safety and \npurity set by WHO global governance regimes resulted in fundamental changes to th e \nmedicines themselves. In this context, in which western epistemology has changed \nmedicines it sought out to understand, it is imperative to respond with the proposal of \n\u2018border thinking\u2019 to produce \u2018localised accounts of best epistemic practices\u2019 (Alcoff , 2007: \n97) rather than privileging any particular epistemology. The aim here is not to deny the \neffectiveness of contemporary western medicine, but to dispute the myth of biomedical \nepistemology as a neutral set of criteria serving as an arbiter of non -western healing \nknowledge and practice. Rather, western medicine should be seen as one particular \ntradition of healing that has reached a high degree of sophistication relative to others, due 88 \n both to the civilisational continuity and prosperity of the wester n societies which have \ndriven it forward, as well as to the genocide or economic subjugation of non -western \ntraditions during the previous several centuries of Euro -American world hegemony. Those \nnon -western healing practices that remain merit engagement n ot only as sources of new \ntherapeutic materials, but also for their conceptual contributions to knowledge about the \nuniversal human concerns of health, illness and healing.  \n \nCulture, Knowledge and the Ontological Turn  \nCase studies such as these help disput e the notion that western societal structures, \nincluding epistemology and its associated legal, regulatory and economic forms, are \n\u2018beyond culture\u2019 and are therefore able to unproblematically understand or incorporate \nother cultures on neutral terms. Yet o f course, the hegemony of western culture has to be \npresented as beyond culture, because the most fundamental elements of any given \nculture are presented not as culture but as knowledge about reality. In contemporary \nwestern culture, for example, political -economic organisation is dominated by \ntechnocratic neoliberal economics, which has great influence on collective behaviour \ndespite its limitations as a knowledge system. Science and technology, particularly \nbiomedicine, stand in a position of greater legi timacy and more strongly reinforce western \ncultural hegemony. Objectivity \u2013in other words, freedom from the bias of the individual\u2019s \nculturally informed subjectivity \u2013is the foundational myth of science and technology; \nindeed, it is the awareness of the haza rds of the subjective position and the subsequent \n(quixotic) practice of reflexivity and self -critique which make western epistemology \nappealing to its practitioners. Nonetheless, it should be recognised that this belief in the 89 \n objectivity of science and t echnology, like western culture\u2019s self -positioning vis -\u00e0-vis \u2018other \ncultures,\u2019 corresponds to what in others we identify as ideology. It is a definitive \ncharacteristic of ideology that it establishes all alternatives as ideological, while refusing \nto accep t any labelling of itself as such; the classic example is the profoundly ideological \npretension of Soviet Marxism to be \u2018scientific\u2019. As Slavoj \u017di\u017eek puts it, \u2018the stepping out of \n(what we experience as) ideology is the very form of our enslavement to it\u2019 (1994: 6). In \nthe same way, western culture is not experienced as \u2018cultural,\u2019 because to be a \u2018culture\u2019 \nwithin the western sphere is to be categorised in accordance with a history of colonialism, \nsubjection and marginalisation, and attendant upon this cate gorisation is a scrutiny from \nwhich the dominant rational discourses (and their institutions) are spared.  \nIf we perceive western knowledge as itself cultural, it becomes impossible to practise \nanthropology on the basis of a conceptualisation of indigenous culture as one particular, \nlimited manner of taking account of the properties of the natural world as we have \nestablished them (Descola, 2013a). Consequently, in place of a modernist ontology dividing \nreality into culture and nature, culture should be seen  as ontological in the sense of \nincorporating ontology. That is to say, a people\u2019s culture includes their understanding of \nthe basic nature of reality (ontology), what Philippe Descola calls \u2018the manner of \nformatting our common experience of the world\u2019 (20 13b: 66); and the means by which \nlegitimate knowledge about that reality can be acquired (epistemology). State \ninterculturality, therefore, must pay special attention to the fundamental differences in \nontology and epistemology across boundaries of cultural  difference. Throughout the \nprocess of delineating the health -seeking preferences of Shuar people in Zamora -\nChinchipe, this thesis will thus focus on the ontological presuppositions implied by the \nvarious health practices encountered. I contend that it is in the experence of health crises 90 \n that fundamental ontological commitments are revealed; and also that the failure of \ncertain healing practices in such moments of crisis acts as a particularly powerful trigger \nfor ontological conversion.  \nSuch an ethnograp hic orientation resonates with proposals for an \u2018ontological turn\u2019 in \nanthropology. This has been put forward as an explicit response to the crisis of confidence \nin anthropological research that followed Clifford and Marcus\u2019s (1986) Writing Culture . As \nEduardo Viveiros de Castro argues, \u2018we should move from the epistemological critique of \nanthropological authority to the ontological determination of ethnographic alterity\u2019 (2014: \n4), based on the claim that \u2018the metaphysics of representation is shown to be m uch more \nefficaciously shattered by means of the ethnographic description of a countermetaphysics \nthan by the internal demystification to which the post -modern criticism was adept\u2019 (2014: \n11). I would contend, also, that the post -modern style of persistent  critique of western \ninstitutions risks producing a sense of alienation from its theories for the innumerable \npeople around the world who perceive benefits in their engagements with certain \nproducts and cultural forms originating in western society.33 It is far more productive to \nsee western knowledge as one particular, valuable situated knowledge to be compared \nwith the situated knowledges that have evolved in other places. Within this frame of \nreference, interculturality signifies the engagement and compet ition between ontologies \nprovenant from the socio -historical experiences of distinct groups of people. As we shall \nsee in Chapters 4, 5 and 6, the de facto , non -state -led intercultural health practice of Shuar \npeople validates the argument of Casper Jensen  and Atsuro Morita that \u2018different \nontologies are often busily interfering with each other [\u2026] ontologies are never \n                                                        \n33 The same schism between the position of anthropologists and of indigenous people can in fact also \nresult from anthropologists\u2019 knee -jerk celebration of all things \u2018indigenous\u2019 (see Chapter 7).  91 \n hermetically sealed but always part of multiple engagements. They offer not only \ndiscursive or conceptual but also practical commentary and critique of other realities\u2019 \n(2012: 366). The analysis presented in this thesis, therefore, adds to the existing literature \na historicist account of the mechanics of change in indigenous metaphysics sensitive to \nthe varying effects of colonial difference e xpressed through economics, religion and \ndiscourse.  \nIn conclusion, the epistemological critique and the conceptualisation of western \nepistemology as one particular form of situated knowledge is fundamental to the project \nof state interculturality. Without it, the various expressions of \u2018cultural difference\u2019 \nrepresented by indigenous and other societies would be meekly assimilated within the \nexisting epistemological and ontological structures that make up the political and \nintellectual hegemony of liberal mu lticulturalism. As this thesis explores state \ninterculturality through the example of the competency of healthcare, this chapter has laid \nout at length a critique of biomedical epistemology and its implication with the \nparticularities of the socio -historic al experience of the Euro -American world. In light of this \ncritique, and the evidence provided of an encounter between the ruling relations of \nbiomedicine and the knowledge practices originating in an Amazonian healing tradition \n(the Aguaruna), it is impos sible to sustain the idea that intercultural health can be \nsatisfactorily constructed through the existing institutions of public health built on the \nwestern model, as preceding critiques of state interculturality have already suggested \n(e.g. Bolados Garc\u00ed a, 2011). Instead, this work pursues the epistemological proposals of \n\u2018border thinking\u2019 as explicated by Walter Mignolo (2000a, 2000b) and Linda Alcoff (2007). \nThe research project of documenting the health -seeking preferences of Shuar people \nacross severa l distinct sites within the Shuar territory of a single Ecuadorian provice is 92 \n situated within the goals expressed by these thinkers to seek out \u2018localised accounts of \nbest epistemic practices\u2019 (Alcoff, 2007: 97). In discussions with Shuar people about thei r \nactions in moments of health crisis, both their most fundamental ontological \npresumptions and their conversion to ontological postulates that differ from those found \nwithin the Shuar tradition are made visible. This fact suggests that the prospects for s tate \ninterculturality will be both dependent on and riven by the kinds of interactions and \nconflicts between the ontologies in question in any one context in which indigenous actors \nmight seek to finally make the state culturally representative. As such, i t would appear that \naddressing the politics of ontology will be fundamental to the campaign for state \ninterculturality.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 93 \n Chapter 3: Shuar People\u2019s Healing Practices in Zamora -Chinchipe, Ecuador  \n \nThe Shuar \u2018Centros\u2019 in Historical Context  \nThis chapter commences by offering a historical contextualisation of the origins of the \n\u2018centros\u2019 in which ethnographic fieldwork was carried out, before presenting the research \ndata itself. By way of exegesis of this statistical data, the chapter then int roduces each of \nthe cultural vectors that are to be explored individually in Chapters 4 \u20137, presenting \ncommon examples from Shuar society that illustrate their influence on health -seeking \nbehaviour. All data was collected during fieldwork in communally -titled Shuar territory in \nthe Ecuadorian province of Zamora -Chinchipe from May 2013 until September 2014. In \ntotal, 64 Shuar people were interviewed. All interviewees were questioned on their own \nuse of medicinal plants, shamans, clinics and other health -seeki ng behaviours, except for \nthe shaman C\u00e9sar Santiak as well as Ricardo Kayuk and Martina Tukupi. These latter two \ninitially discussed their health -seeking preferences and practices before later also divulging \nand discussing their work as \u2018ayahuasqueros\u2019 and  practitioners of \u2018magia\u2019 (\u2018magic,\u2019 loosely \ntranslated, or \u2018black magic\u2019; see Taussig [1987: 259]). The interviews were carried out in \nfour \u2018centros\u2019 in three general locations (see Figure 1): Kiim, a small town wedged between \nthe Yacuambi River and an eco logical reserve; the Quimi River Valley, which takes in the \nShuar communities of Yanua and Churubia as well as the Mirador gold and copper mine; \nand Shaime in the remote Upper Nangaritza River Basin, a hub of Shuar social organisation \nin the region and a s ite frequently visited by residents of smaller neighbouring Shuar \ncommunities. For reference, I estimate the total Shuar population of Zamora -Chinchipe to \nbe approximately 12,000. This is based on the 2010 census, in which 79,709 people 94 \n identified as Shuar , discussions with federation leaders and other sources (e.g. El \nTel\u00e9grafo, 2011) which suggest that  approximately two -thirds of Ecuadorian Shuar l ive in \nMorona -Santiago province, with the rest split between Zamora -Chinchipe and the other \nAmazonian provin ces.  \nJivaroan peoples have historically lived in large polygynous households dispersed \nthroughout the rainforest (Harner, 1972: 77; also Descola, 1996). Uxorilocal residence and \nthe absence of corporate descent groups undermined the potential for the accum ulation \nof political power (Rubenstein, 1993: 3; Rubenstein, 2012: 56), a characteristic of Jivaroan \nsociety furthered by the fact that a man\u2019s power was seen to be simply \u2018based on a \ncombination of personal prestige and the capacity to manipulate vast net works of alliance\u2019 \n(Taylor, 1981: 655). Households occasionally formed small clusters in the more productive \nriverine territory, but tended to be widely separated in interfluvial territory (Descola, 1981: \n616). The concentration \u2013or \u2018sedenterizaci\u00f3n\u2019 \u2013of the  Shuar population into the \u2018centros\u2019 \nseen today took place through the engagement with missionaries, along with the \nsimultaneous pressure from colonists from the Ecuadorian highlands, especially from the \n1960s.  \nThe Shuar of the contemporary province of Za mora -Chinchipe were exposed to Spanish \ncolonialism early, with the original settlement of Zamora (some 65km down -river from \nwhere the city lies today) founded in the mid -sixteenth century because of the presence \nof gold. At the close of the century, howeve r, an organised indigenous uprising destroyed \nall four Spanish settlements in Shuar country. This historical event gave rise to the legend \nthat the Spanish governor of the town of Sevilla de Oro was killed by his Shuar captors \nwhen they forced him to drink  molten gold to satisfy his greed (Padilla, 2012: 62, 89). The 95 \n Shuar people were then left alone by Ecuadorian society for three centuries, buttressed \nby a reputation for savagery that grew from this history as well as the ancestral practice \nof shrinking h eads.  \nIn 1888, the Ecuadorian Amazon was divided up into \u2018Vicariatos Apost\u00f3licos\u2019 by the \ngovernment,  apportioning spiritual dominion between the Jesuit, Salesian, Dominican and \nFranciscan Catholic missionary orders. In 1892 the Franciscans founded a miss ion at the \npresent -day site of Zamora and then another nearby at Yacuambi34 in 1893, while the \nSalesians founded missions in Gualaquiza and elsewhere in present -day Morona -Santiago \nlater that decade (Bottasso, 2011: 21). The Franciscans\u2019 efforts, however, t urned out to be \nshort -lived. The Yacuambi mission was abandoned the following year due to an outbreak \nof malaria; one Franciscan reported, without irony, that \u2018our lives came under threat by \nthe Indians\u2019 stupid, shamelessly repeated superstition that we ha d introduced the disease\u2019 \n(Izaguirre, 1978: 238 -9). The Zamora mission, meanwhile, was abandoned in 1897. This \ndecision could be tied to the beginnings of Ecuador\u2019s Liberal Revolution in 1895, with the \nconcomitant collapse in mission financing, although ju st as significant was likely the fact \nthat the Franciscans had not managed to attract any converts (\u2018nos hemos quedado \ncompletamente hu\u00e9rfanos de salvajitos\u2019 [Izaguirre, 1978: 226]).35 \nIn spite of Ecuador\u2019s nascent secularisation, the missions were only to become more \nsignificant to the Ecuadorian state in the twentieth century. The colonisation of the \nAmazon served as a sort of pressure valve to defuse social conflicts around land ownership \nin the highlands (Salazar, 1981: 593), particularly after the 1964 dissolution of the \n                                                        \n34 San Jos\u00e9 de Yacuambi is officially known as 28 de mayo and appears on Figure 1 as such.  \n35 Their ethnocentrism evidently posed a very significant barrier. In the 1890s, Franciscans reported that the \nShuar \u2018violate the most obvious precepts of natural law daily and with impunity\u2019; and that their \u2018essential \ncharacter \u2019 was one of \u2018indifference, disdain and the blackest ingratitude\u2019 (Izaguirre, 1978: 227, 241).  96 \n \u2018huasipungo\u2019 system, analogous to serfdom (Casagrande, 1981: 263), along with other \nmethods of forced indigenous labour (Ortiz Crespo, 1992: 96). The missionaries \nthemselves encouraged dreams of agricultural bounty in the Amazon, present ed as \u2018virgin \nlands of prodigious fertility for all classes of products, especially those for export, like \ncoffee, cocao, coca, etc., which are so consumed in the Old World\u2019 (Bottasso, 2011: 30 -31). \nColonisation was also deemed essential to ward off furthe r territorial annexations by Peru \nafter the 1941 war. The missionaries\u2019 role in \u2018pacifying\u2019 the Shuar therefore received \nconsistent support from the central government; a 1955 presidential decree granted them \ndirect financial assistance, tax -free status, d uty-free imports and free cargo transport from \nthe military in exchange for the obligation to \u2018civilise and indoctrinate the savage tribes\u2019 \n(Salazar, 1981: 605).  \nThe Franciscans had returned to re -found their Zamora mission in 1921, then went on to \nfound m issions at Yacuambi (1936), Guadalupe (1951), Yantzaza (1963), Zumbi (1964), El \nPangui (1965) and Guayzimi (1972)(Padilla, 2012: 180 -8). Although originally oriented \ntoward the conversion of the Shuar, the missions quickly became hubs of social \norganisatio n connecting Shuar territory into the political -economic networks of \nEcuadorian society. As a Salesian historian described it:  \nWherever the mission is established, colonizers will agglomerate, because \u201cmission\u201d means \nschool for boys, dress -making classes f or girl [sic], spiritual assistance [\u2026] hospital and \ndispensary [\u2026] Until the cooperatives of the 1970s, until the settlement of colonizers \norganised by a para -state entity (The Centre for the Economic Transformation of the South \n[CREA]), nearly all Amazon ian towns were born as mission residences among indigenous \npeople, and within a few decades transformed into settlements of highland mestizos. The 97 \n indigenous people of the area [\u2026] end up going there sporadically for petty commerce at the \nmarkets, or for h ealth problems  (Bottasso, 2011: 36 -37). \nThis brief sketch helps to visualise the history of the Shuar \u2018centros\u2019 of Kiim (7km from \nGuadalupe) and of Yanua and Churubia, located about 20km from both El Pangui to the \nsouth and Bomboiza (formerly a Salesian m ission) to the north, and also gives a fairly \naccurate representation of contemporary Shuar people\u2019s use for these population centres. \nAs Anne -Christine Taylor writes, the missions were \u2018highly ambivalent institutions from the \nviewpoint of the Indians\u2019 (19 99: 219). They afforded Shuar with access to biomedicine, but \nalso spread epidemic disease. One middle -aged woman from the Yacuambi River Valley \nsaid, \u2018With measles, so many of them [our ancestors] died. That\u2019s what my grandmother \ntold me.\u2019 The missions al so provided access to manufactured goods such as pots, \nmachetes and fish -hooks which came to be regarded as essential. According to Taylor, \nsuch items were called \u2018god wealth\u2019 by Achuar, a phrase indicative of the Jivaroan notion \n\u2018that technical mastery is  rooted in symbolic mastery,\u2019 and that therefore \u2018the \ntechnological power and wealth of the missionaries [must be] the result of techniques of \nsupernatural control\u2019 (Taylor, 1981: 671). This therefore promoted a sentiment of \nmelancholy and alienation at th e ineffectuality of their own symbolic practices, especially \namong women, who were marginalised from the nascent market economy (Taylor, 1981: \n660 -2). At the same time, the missions effected a dramatic intervention on Shuar society \nvia the boarding school system, a central item of missionising strategy. Initially, \n\u2018recruitment of children for boarding schools was the hardest problem for both Salesian \nand Franciscan misionaries. Until a few years ago, at least in the case of the Fransciscan \nmission, the usua l procedure was kidnapping\u2019 (Salazar, 1981: 592), a practice permitted the \nmissionaries due to the backing of the police and army. In more recent decades, however, 98 \n Shuar parents began to volunteer their children to the boarding schools, perceiving \u2018the \nputative profitability of association with the spheres of white power\u2019 (Taylor, 1981: 660), \nin particular the profitability of developing the ability to speak Spanish.  \nFrom a situation where the Shuar of Zamora -Chinchipe were attempting to defend their \nlands  from colonists whilst also maintaing contact and trade with the missions, a \nconvergence of factors in the 1960s and 70s led to today\u2019s \u2018centros\u2019 being established and \nlegalised as communally owned indigenous territory. Firstly, theological changes followi ng \nthe Vatican II ecumenical council (1962 \u201365) led to permanent missions, including the \nboarding schools and forced labour, being gradually abandoned.36 The adoption of the \nprinciple of divine incarnation \u2013which holds that God has always been present in nasc ent \nform in native religions \u2013produced a shift toward itinerant preaching with the objective of \nChristian adaptation of indigenous practices (Bottasso, Bottasso & M\u00fcnzel, 1979; Taylor, \n1981: 674). Secondly, roughly coinciding with this theological shift was  the expiration of \nthe missions\u2019 official tutelage over Shuar lands in 1969. In anticipation, in 1964 the Salesians \nfacilitated the foundation of the \u2018Federaci\u00f3n Interprovincial de Centros Shuar\u2019 \n(Interprovincial Federation of Shuar Centres \u2013FISCH), often r eferred to simply as the \n\u2018Federaci\u00f3n Shuar.\u2019 Salesian control persisted via the Federation, despite a political \nstructure that empowered Shuar members. For example, the system of radio schooling \nset up by the Federation was institutionalised as \u2018fisco -misi onal\u2019 rather than public so as to \nkeep the schools under the control of the missionaries instead of the state, reportedly \n                                                        \n36 Despite receiving state funds for their schooling, the missions obliged Shuar children to work six days per \nweek, ostensively to produce the food consumed on t he missions. The degree to which the missions profited \nfrom child labour is contentious. Ernesto Salazar has argued: \u2018[A] fact that cannot be overlooked is that the \nreligious mission in general has degenerated from a Christian religious enterprise into a C hristian economic \none\u2019 (1981: 592). Shuar accounts to ethnographer Steven Rubenstein were that their time on the missions was \none of \u2018slavery\u2019 (2001: 272).  99 \n against the wishes of Shuar Federation leaders (Salazar, 1981: 594, 604 -5). Nonetheless, as \none of the first indigenous federations in  the world, the FISCH represents a significant \nmilestone of indigenous autonomy.  \nFinally, these developments occurred in a context of Ecuadorian state initiatives which \nboth stimulated colonisation of the Amazon but also provided the legal framework \nthrou gh which Shuar people could claim title to the land they currently occupied. From the \n1960s, CREA and other state agencies operated \u2018semi -directed colonisation\u2019 of the Amazon \n(Salazar, 1981: 593), with lands titled by the Ecuadorian Institute of Agrarian R eform and \nColonisation (IERAC). At the behest of the new Shuar Federation, however, IERAC also \nworked to demarcate and title Shuar lands. These were organised as the collective \nproperty of the \u2018centros\u2019, which were the base administrative unit of the Feder ation, rather \nthan of individual families, in order to speed up the process via single, large titles. \nImportantly, ownership of land was taken on by Shuar \u2018centros\u2019 as cooperatives, and not \nunder a policy of indigenous land recognition per se, with the pro viso that individuals could \nonly sell land to others within the \u2018centro\u2019. At the same time, FISCH channeled \ndevelopment aid to initiate a program of loans to Shuar \u2018centros\u2019 for the purpose of cattle -\nraising (Hendricks, 1988: 234 -5; Rubenstein, 2001: 280).  In this, FISCH was responding to \nIERAC policy that land could be reclaimed if it did not produce for five consecutive years, \na measure directed at the great hereditary estates of the highlands, but one entirely \nunsuitable to the ecological parameters of t he rainforest and heedless of the ancestral \npractice of swidden agriculture (Descola, 1981: 641; Salazar, 1981: 602). In short, in \nresponse to the existential threat of colonisation, the Shuar \u2018centros\u2019 appropriated \ncolonisation\u2019s juridical tools in order to secure their own recognition. For these reasons, \nmost Shuar people today live in small nucleated settlements, typically centred around a 100 \n chapel and a soccer or volleyball pitch, surrounded by communally titled territory that is \napportioned to individual  households within the \u2018centro\u2019 who work their plots blending \nswidden agriculture with raising cattle on pasture.  \nFigure 2: The Shuar \u2018centro\u2019  Kiim in 2013, seen from across the Yacuambi River, with its chapel \nin the centre  \n \nSuch a schematic history should not allow us to forget the human element. The leaders \nresponsible for managing the legalisation of \u2018centros\u2019 in both the Quimi River Valley and \nthe Upper Nangaritza Valley both related stories to me of violent confrontations  with \nmestizos and a hostile atmosphere outside their \u2018centros\u2019 during this period. These are not \n\u2018historical\u2019 events; because of its relative geographical isolation, Shuar territory in \nNangaritza was only legalised in the first decade of this century. I e ncountered families in \n101 \n Nangaritza whose grandparents had come to the area fleeing mestizo colonization along \nthe Quimi River. Then while staying in Shuar towns in the Quimi River Valley months later, \nan elderly couple described their first experience of Ec uadorian colonists as follows:  \nEmiliano \u2013 There were miners first. They came along the Zamora River [digging for gold]. My \ngrandfather and uncle fought, and were sent running. They had to hide, and after that they \nwouldn\u2019t talk with anyone.  \nDaniela \u2013 Whe n the Christians came we had to run like agoutis.  \nEmiliano \u2013 But first, they would come and talk, asking for chicha and cassava.  \nDaniela \u2013 They wanted to drink chicha. That\u2019s why they came. Then they started to rob \nchooks and pigs, carrying off whatever they could. That\u2019s when people became afraid.  \nEmiliano \u2013 They had to hide. The colonisers would carry off chicha and maize, chooks and \npigs.  \nQ \u2013 And were the colonisers armed?  \nEmiliano \u2013 Of course.  \nDaniela \u2013 That\u2019s why our grandparents were afraid. They c ame to start fights and even kill.  \nProduct of the harsh reality of violence and the shock of epidemic disease, the \nintergenerational memory of middle -aged and elderly Shuar people is coloured by the \nexperience of social dislocation common to indigenous peo ples. \u2018I suffered growing up,\u2019 \nsaid the previously quoted Daniela. \u2018We had no shoes, nor blankets, nor baskets, nothing. \nNow people have everything. Even the little ones wear shoes. They\u2019re practically wearing \nshoes while still in the womb. We were survivo rs. We didn\u2019t even have salt to eat with our \ncassava.\u2019 In a similar vein, her husband Emiliano recounted, \u2018When I was young, I had \nnothing. It was suffering. When I was as big as him [indicating a grandson], we had \nnothing, nothing. We slept on the ground.  I had rags for blankets.\u2019 This depiction contrasts 102 \n markedly with what Philippe Descola and Anne -Christine Taylor found in much more \nremote Jivaroan households in the late 1970s, which at this stage was mostly autonomous \nfrom Ecuadorian society: men, women  and children sleeping on raised beds with their feet \nwarmed over smouldering fires (Descola, 1996: 43), and a diet of plentiful calories and \nprotein (Descola, 1994: 210). This contrast between the testimonies of the contemporary \nelder generation in Zamora -Chinchipe and the lifeways encountered by Descola and Taylor \naround the same time but in a more remote region speaks to the widespread disruption of \nautochthonous lifeways and the dislocation of social units in the province in the latter half \nof the twent ieth century.  \nThough the legal borders of Shuar territory have stabilished, the conflict itself has not been \nsuperseded. In November 2016, a group of armed Shuar men occupied a mining camp in \nMorona -Santiago and expelled its workers at gunpoint, before be ing forced to flee when \nthe central government declared martial law. The camp is being run by the same Chinese \ncompany that operates the Mirador gold and copper mine in the Quimi River Valley (El \nComercio, 2016). In a similar vein, a Shuar man living on th e Quimi told me that several \nyears ago, he confronted mestizos grazing cattle on land claimed by his family in the upper \npart of the valley and forced them at gunpoint to return to the nearest town. A few months \nafter I finished up my research in 2014, the  man was found murdered in a case that remains \nunsolved. The man was also a vocal opponent of the Mirador mine.  \n \n \n 103 \n Figure 3: Disputed land in the Upper Quimi River Valley in 2014  \n \nAround the same time, a \u2018white\u2019 family in the provincial city of Macas, so me 275km to the \nnorth of Zamora -Chinchipe, described to me in horrified tones the robbery of their son by \ntwo Shuar men at knifepoint. When asked whether the attackers were ever captured by \nthe police, they replied, \u2018They fled off into the jungle. How are we going to pursue them \nthere?\u2019 Though hysterical in giving the false impression of being hemmed in by \nimpenetrable forest, it is true that communally -titled land is difficult to navigate without \nthe requisite local knowledge and connections and that the p resence of police on such \nland is highly contentious. Among Shuar people, the impression is widespread that the \npolice represent mestizo  society. Likewise, as illustrated by the fate of the man from the \nQuimi River Valley, the protection afforded to Shuar people by the forces of law and order \n104 \n is only partial, for both geographic and historical reasons. Although the lands legally titled \nto Shuar communities are a discontinuous patchwork, the sense of a frontier between \nShuar territory and the rest of Ecuador ian society is therefore very real. Once, seeing a \ncampaign poster for the then President Rafael Correa while walking in a Shuar town, I \nasked a primary school -aged child who had taken to following me around if he knew who \nthe man in the picture was.  \u2018Cor rea,\u2019 he replied. Wondering if he knew that Correa was the \npresident, I asked, \u2018What is his occupation?\u2019 \u2018Killing,\u2019 the boy told me.  \nIn mid -2015, the generalised hostility toward the government that my young friend had \nabsorbed erupted in the Shuar heartl and of Morona -Santiago. The imaginary frontier \nbetween mestizo  society and the jungle was punctured by Shuar protesters who overran \nriot police and besieged government offices in the provincial capital Macas for several \ndays. When police initially tried to  clear the protesters using their shields and batons, they \nwere battered back themselves by Shuar men wielding ten -foot spears. At other times, the \npotential for conflict is belied by the coexistence between mestizo  townspeople and the \nwell -heeled Shuar co mmunity leaders and bilingual education system schoolteachers who \ndo business in the urban world; as well as between the young people of all stripes who mix \nin the provincial cities in search of fun, work and money.  \n \nQuantitative Analysis of Interviewees\u2019 Health -Seeking Preferences  \nThe presentation of research data begins with the most objective, least interpreted \nelements gathered from the interviews: the preferences expressed by research \nparticipants between medical systems at the most basic level, citin g the common \njustifications and associated keywords offered by participants to explain their positions. 105 \n This allows for the broad differences in stances between people who are part of different \nreligious, geographical, political and economic communities to  be delineated before \nresearcher interpretation is drawn upon in order to explain the diversity of practices and \ntheir local significance. It should be noted that although the potential for differences in \nhealth -seeking behaviours depending on geographic l ocation and economic practices \n(wage -labour vs subsistence) was perceived early in the ethnographic process, with \nresearch sites chosen accordingly, my awareness of differences originating with political \nand religious affiliation and discourse developed or ganically during my time in Zamora -\nChinchipe. As such, the way in which data precedes analysis in the sequencing of these \nchapters can be seen to mirror the order in which these patterns came to my own \nattention. The idea is, above all, to avoid the pseudo -literary style of monograph in which \nchoice quotes from informants are selected by the author at will, like a succession of \nrabbits pulled out of a hat. While this type of monograph may be an effective way to \nprovoke a sudden sense of understanding of a f oreign culture, its relative lack of \ntransparency makes it inappropriate for social -anthropological research aiming to \nrepresent intercultural health practices, intracultural diversity and the dynamics from \nwhich both are produced. Once adherence to the ge neralised positions is detailed, \nsubsequent chapters will delve into the analysis of each group\u2019s engagement with medical \npractices as both indicative and generative of cultural change and Shuar individuals\u2019 \nworldviews.  \nClearly the categorizations accordin g to geography, economy, political and religious \naffiliation are not exclusive, and this mitigates the rather small sample size of sixty -one \ninterviewees who were questioned on their health -seeking practices. With regards to \ngeographic isolation, the inter viewees are divided between residents living greater or less 106 \n than two hours travel from one of the regional centres \u2013the small cities of Zamora, \nYantzatza and Gualaquiza (the latter is located in the province of Morona -Santiago, just to \nthe north of Zamora -Chinchipe) \u2013where hospital care is available. This meant that only \nthose Shuar living in Alto Nangartiza were classified as geographically isolated, a fact \nwhich reflected the high esteem in which these people were held as representatives of \n\u2018true\u2019 Shuar cu lture. On the economic level, interviewees are divided according to whether \ntheir household\u2019s primary means of survival is mining (either waged or independent, so -\ncalled \u2018artisan\u2019 mining) or subsistence agriculture, with the latter not excluding those who \noccasionally sell produce (cattle, \u2018naranjilla\u2019  [Solanum quitoense], chickens, timber, cacao, \ncoffee, \u2018chonta\u2019). Although such households do sometimes purchase food, most \ncommonly rice, cooking oil, eggs and tinned fish, their primary sustenance was \nnoneth eless an indigenous diet of cassava (\u2018yuca\u2019), plantain, a variety of taro (\u2018papachina\u2019, \nShuar: papach ; Latin: Xanthosoma roseum), chicken, duck, fish, \u2018chonta\u2019  (Shuar: uwi; Latin: \nBactris gasipaes), \u2018aguaje\u2019  (Shuar: achu ; Latin: Mauritia flexuosa), various  palm hearts and \nforest game (mainly agouti, paca and peccary).  Religious affiliation was divided between \nthe majority Catholics and the Protestant Evangelicals, a difference which provoked \nfrequent outbursts of consternation on both sides. Finally, extern al political influence was \nassessed based on whether or not interviewees\u2019 incorporated the discourse characteristic \nof the Pachakutik (PK) party and the international indigenous rights movement in their \nself-expression on the subject of hea lth-seeking beha viour; and  whether  or not  the \n\u2018centro\u2019 in which they lived was affiliated with CONAIE -PK  (\u2018PK -affiliated\u2019 in tables).  \nBeginning with the preferences of Shuar interviewees in Zamora -Chinchipe between \nclinical medicine and alternative options, there are clearly great differences between \nShuar people depending on their location, political affiliation, religion and economic 107 \n position. The singular fact that a person is Shuar and lives on collectively titled indigenous \nterritory seems to tell us little about their health -seeking preferences , and the worldview \nupon which these are based, at least without also making reference to other \ncharacteristics. This marked intracultural diversity is a significant complication to \ncampaigns to extend state interculturality to the s phere of healthcare.  \nTable 1: Reliant on clinics and/or hospitals for healthcare  \n YES NO AMBIGUOUS  \nRemote areas  4 (14%)  23 (79%)  2 (7%)  \nWaged miners  8 (67%)  4 (33%)  0 \nAll miners  12 (71%)  4 (23%)  1 (6%)  \nEvangelicals  5 (50%)  5 (50%)  0 \nPK-affiliated  4 (12%)  27 (82%)  2 (6%)  \nAll 19 (31%)  37 (61%)  5 (8%)  \n \nTable 2: Use clinical medicine, but see other options as preferable in certain circumstances  \n YES NO AMBIGUOUS  \nRemote areas  16 (55%)  11 (38%)  2 (7%)  \nWaged miners  4 (33%)  8 (67%)  0 \nAll miners  5 (29%)  9 (53%)  3 (18%)  \nEvangelicals  2 (20%)  7 (70%)  1 (10%)  \nPK-affiliated  19 (58%)  12 (36%)  2 (6%)  \nAll 31 (51%)  24 (39%)  6 (10%)  108 \n Table 3: Reject biomedical services, or consider only as a last resort  \n YES NO AMBIGUOUS  \nRemote areas  7 (24%)  19 (66%)  3 (10%)  \nWaged miners  0 12 (100%)  0 \nAll miners  0 17 (100%)  0 \nEvangelicals  2 (20%)  8 (80%)  0 \nPK-affiliated  8 (24%)  22 (67%)  3 (9%)  \nAll 9 (15%)  49 (80%)  3 (5%)  \n \nJust 31.1 percent of interviewees were reliant on biomedical services from clinics and \nhospitals in case of illness. A greater proportion, 50.8 percent, would seek out clinical \nmedical treatment in certain circu mstances, depending mainly on their perception of the \ncause of the illness. Finally, a not -insignificant proportion 14.7 percent of interviewees say \nthat they avoid going to clinics at hospitals if at all possible, citing deep suspicions of either \nthe capa city or intentions of biomedical practitioners and the nation -state providing these \nservices.  \nMany Shuar people evidently have serious reservations about the model of state \nhealthcare offered to them in Zamora -Chinchipe. This is, however, not a generalisab le \nconclusion; it is a deeply -held conviction is some areas and a non -existent one in others. As \nTable 3 illustrates, in remote areas and in PK -affiliated towns, some 24 percent of \ninterviewees reject biomedical services. By contrast, none of the interview ees whose \nprimary economic activity was mining \u2013all of whom live in the surrounds of the Mirador \ngold and copper mine in the Quimi River Valley (see Figure 1, north -east sector) \u2013express 109 \n this same preference. Indeed, 70.6 percent of miners interviewed were e ntirely reliant on \nclinical medical services in case of illness. In the Shuar context, then, a model of \u2018culturally -\nsensitive\u2019 health provision which included \u2018traditional medical practitioners\u2019 alongside \nclinical professionals (e.g. Pigg, 1995) would like ly be met with derision in certain Shuar \ncommunities. Indeed, the interviewees were especially divided in their opinions of the \nvalue of shamans, known as uwishin  in the Shuar language.  \nTable 4: Consult and/or seek treatments from shamans  \n YES NO AMBIGUOUS  \nRemote areas  18 (62%)  5 (17%)  6 (21%)  \nWaged miners  2 (16.5%)  8 (67%)  2 (16.5%)  \nAll miners  5 (29%)  9 (53%)  3 (18%)  \nEvangelicals  2 (20%)  8 (80%)  0 \nPK-affiliated  21 (64%)  5 (15%)  7 (21%)  \nAll 32 (52%)  15 (25%)  14 (23%)  \n \nAn explanatory note, firstly: although this would seem an amenable question for direct \nyes/no answers, the number of interviewees offering ambiguous responses was quite high \n(22.9 percent). This can be attributed to the ambivalent ethical position of shamans in \nShuar society: for those  who believe in their capacities, they are considered capable of \nboth causing and curing illness, with the power to do one a direct indication of the \npotential to do the other. As such, interviewees with whom I did not already have a close \nrelationship wer e perhaps guarded in expressing personal familiarity with shamans and \nthe details of shamanic practice.  110 \n Responses to this question differed to a similar extent as responses about use of \nbiomedical services. While 62 percent of residents of remote Shuar tow ns consult shamans \n(and another 20.7 percent refused to confirm or deny that they do so), just 29.4 percent \nof miners would do so. For waged miners, the figure was just 16.5 percent. Amongst \nEvangelicals, two of whom were waged miners, the rejection of the  validity of shamans \nwas just as great, with 80 percent saying they would never seek treatment from them. As \nin the case of willingness to use biomedical services, the overall figure for the proportion \nof interviewees who consult with shamans (52.4 percent ) is limited in its usefulness in \nisolation.  \nTable 5: Consider experiences during altered states of consciousness important for health  \n YES NO AMBIGUOUS  \nRemote areas  17 (59%)  3 (10%)  9 (31%)  \nWaged miners  1 (8%)  11 (92%)  0 \nAll miners  3 (18%)  11 (64%)  3 (18%)  \nEvangelicals  4 (40%)  4 (40%)  2 (20%)  \nPK-affiliated  17 (52%)  5 (15%)  11 (33%)  \nAll 24 (39%)  18 (30%)  19 (31%)  \n \nTable 5 brings a further degree of subtlety to these results. It has become somewhat of an \naxiom in the literature of medical anthropology and international public health that the \nshaman represents a figure who mediates society\u2019s interactions with \u2018the sup ernatural\u2019 \u2013\nor worlds beyond the immediately visible material reality \u2013and is responsible for the \ncohesion of society when faced with the inexplicable (e.g. Scheper -Hughes, 1987: 16). As 111 \n was explained in Chapter 1, intellectual discussions of traditional med icine tend towards \nprivileging either herbalism as a philosophically materialist, proto -scientific indigenous \nempiricism, on the one hand; or shamanism, on the other, as encapsulating the true \nprofundity of indigenous cosmology and its ubiquitousness in th e traditional healing \npractice of a given culture. When speaking of shamanism, the expectation is an individual \nmarked out and set aside from his or her society. By virtue of dedicated adolescent rites, \nsocial isolation, the inheritance of certain attribut es through family, or serendipitous \nevents in the individual\u2019s life (Eliade, 1975: 76), the shaman becomes singularly adept at \nnavigating the phenomenal experience of other worlds and guiding his or her otherwise \nna\u00efve fellow human beings through the same experience.  \nWhat emerged in these interviews, by contrast, is that in Shuar society the experience of \nvisions during altered states of consciousness does not depend on the involvement of a \nshaman. Rather, such practices are managed at the level of the ind ividual, or the nuclear \nfamily. For his or her part, the shaman is considered adept at leveraging such states in \norder to diagnose patients, and then potentially carry out a cure, depending on how he or \nshe perceives the nature of the illness. This distinc tion between the role of the shaman as \nan essential mediator with the supernatural and the Shuar context \u2013a sort of democratic, \nplant -inspired religiosity according to which any Shuar individual can access perceptions of \na reality beyond that which is ordin arily visible \u2013is by no means unknown to specialists in \nthe ethnography of Jivaroan language groups (see Brown, 1985: 59; Descola, 1996: 299 -\n314; Rubenstein, 2012). Nonetheless, it is noteworthy here in bringing a further degree of \ncomplexity to this pictur e of Shuar health -seeking practices, which are enriched not just \nby clinical medicine and a traditional medicine all too readily divided between the material \nas herbalism and the spiritual as shamanism. For contemporary Shuar people, the latter 112 \n category in cludes not only the specialist interventions of shamans, but also their own \nspiritual practices oriented towards a complex of ideals including personal development, \nlearning and socialisation (see Chapter 4), all of which associate health with values such as \nstrength, hardness, luck, fortune and imperviousness to external threats and internal \nweaknesses.   \nThe importance of altered states of consciousness was mostly evident among Shuar \npeople living in remote areas: to 58.6 percent of them, to be specific, with another 31 \npercent giving mixed or qualified responses. As will be detailed in Chapter 4, the way they \nexpressed their ideas demonstrated a clear genealogy with the descriptions of psychedelic \nvision -seeking and the Ar\u00fatam complex of beliefs pieced to gether by Michael Harner \n(1972) from his experiences living among Shuar people some 60 years ago. It is this \npersistence of the ontology (and relatedly, the epistemology) indigenous to this territory \nthat is one of the most marked features of intracultural  diversity amongst Shuar people in \nZamora -Chinchipe today. Opposingly, among waged miners 91.7 percent stated that such \nexperiences, which they were familiar with mainly though stories as well as, on occasion, \ntheir own halting experimentation, were not im portant to them and did not inform their \npreferences in maintaining health and curing illness.  \nAmong Evangelicals, finally, 40 percent discussed the significance of visions seen in altered \nstates of consciousness for their understanding of health and heal ing. This number was \nsurprisingly high in comparison with the group\u2019s rejection of both vision -inducing plants, \nwhich they tend to refer to as \u2018drugs,\u2019 as well as of shamanism as a legitimate practice. In \ntheir responses, one can see how this attachment to  visions, historically sanctioned in \nShuar society as an experience of transcendent truth, is transformed rather than erased 113 \n by Evangelical proselytising, in a manner that in fact comes to resemble the Catholic \ntradition of revelation obtained through pray er, fasting and self -deprivation. Explaining \nthese dramatic divergences between residents of remote areas, miners and Evangelicals \nwill be the subject of Chapters 4, 5 and 6, respectively.  \nLastly, Chapter 7 will tackle the influence of the common themes of  the discourse of the \nindigenous cultural -revivalist political party Pachakutik on the way Shuar people in \nZamora -Chinchipe think about and express themselves on the subject of healthcare and \ntraditional medicine. In a form of Chinese whispers, many interv iewees had developed the \nidea that the \u2018gringo\u2019  researcher staying in their town had come to carry out research on \n\u2018nuestra medicina ancestral\u2019  (\u2018our ancestral medicine\u2019). Although the actual objectives of \nthe research in developing a portrait of Shuar hea lth-seeking preferences in the province \nfor the purpose of intercultural health were always explained at the commencement of \ninterviews, this sense that interviewees were expected to speak about, flaunt their \nknowledge of and celebrate Shuar traditional me dicine often coloured the conversations \nthat followed. Indeed, demonstrations of the knowledge and rituals associated with \ntraditional medicine have been instrumental in legitimising claims to indigeneity elsewhere \nin the region (e.g. Jackson & Ram\u00edrez, 20 09: 536). As the research process unfolded and \nthe pattern was repeated, it became clear that this politically -loaded aspect to discussions \nof traditional medicine had to be made an explicit part of the study. The aim here is not to \nweed out \u2018political bia s\u2019 from interviewees\u2019 otherwise putatively neutral accounts of their \nvarying health -seeking behaviours and the worldview which informs them. Instead, the \nidea is to consider this political discourse as but one example of a cultural vector \u2013like \ngeographical  isolation, waged mining and Protestant Evangelism \u2013which generates \nintracultural diversity and complicates any attempt to represent Shuar health -seeking 114 \n practices and develop an intercultural health policy for \u2018the Shuar\u2019 as a neatly delineated \nindigenous cultural group.  \nTable 6: Presence of PK discourse in the self -expression of users of various health -seeking \nmodalities  \n Interviewees who employ \nPK discourse  Interviewees who do not \nemploy PK discourse  \n... and use medicinal plants  17 (81%)  26 (68%)  \n... and use clinics  14 (67%)  29 (76%)  \n... and use shamans  11 (52%)  20 (53%)  \n... and use visionary practice  10 (48%)  18 (47%)  \nTotal  21 (100%)  38 (100%)  \n \nOn a methodological note, the number of people cited as influenced by Pachakutik \ndiscourse can be considered an underestimate, if anything; because there was no way to \nreliably prompt this aspect of the responses without biasing them, and because in any case \nit was not a factor that I had originally intended to consider, only those interviewees who \ndem onstrated this way of thinking during the interview of their own accord could be \nincluded. As such, the study actually measures the number of people who make use of PK \ndiscourse in their self -expression, rather than the number of people whose thinking may \nhave been influenced by the discourse. Having said that, there is no reason to suspect that \nthis would prejudice the figures in a relative sense for any particular subset of the \ninterviewee cohort.  115 \n As for the figures themselves, the most immediately striki ng element is the similarity in \nhealth -seeking behaviour between interviewees who expressed themselves in the terms \nof PK discourse and those who did not. Indeed, with regard to recourse to shamanic \nhealing and importance attributed to vision -seeking pract ices, the proportions were \npractically identical in each group. A slightly higher proportion of the non -PK discourse \ngroup were willing to make use of clinical medicine; this shows that the few interviewees \nwho rejected clinical medicine outright tended to  express their ideas by making use of \nthemes of indigenous cultural revival and resistance to colonisation. The greatest \ndifference (13 percent) was in use of medicinal plants, which are such an emblematic \naspect of indigenous traditional medicine and non -western cultural expression as a whole. \nEven so, the difference was far from stark, such that we might tentatively conclude that \nthe diffusion of PK discourse has had minimal causative impact on the health -seeking \npreferences of Shuar people in Zamora -Chin chipe.  \nTable 7: Pachakutik discourse notable in interviewees\u2019 responses  \n YES NO AMBIGUOUS  \nRemote areas  8 (27.5%)  19 (65.5%)  2 (7%)  \nPK-affiliated \u2018centros\u2019  11 (33%)  20 (61%)  2 (6%)  \nNon -PK-affiliated \n\u2018centros\u2019  10 (36%)  17 (61%)  1 (3%)  \nWaged miners  3 (25%)  9 (75%)  0 \nAll miners  4 (24%)  13 (76%)  0 \nEvangelicals  4 (40%)  6 (60%)  0 \nAll 21 (34%)  37 (61%)  3 (5%)  116 \n A further surprising element emerges when the presence of PK discourse in interviewee \nresponses is correlated with the cultural vectors (geographic, economic, religious) already \nmentioned, as well as with the political affiliation of the Shuar centres of w hich each \ninterviewee is a member. The most striking fact to be observed here is that the proportion \nof interviewees in communities affiliated with Pachakutik through the indigenous \nfederation structure whose language matched the characteristic themes of P K discourse \nwas nearly identical to the proportion who expressed themselves in that way in \ncommunities not affiliated with Pachakutik. Just a third of interviewees in PK -affiliated \ntowns discussed their health practices in terms of a perceived need to revi ve indigenous \nculture and eschew the corrupting influence of mainstream Ecuadorian society. In \ncommunities not affiliated with Pachakutik, the figure was actually slightly higher, at 35.7 \npercent. One can only come to the curious conclusion that the politi cal affiliation of Shuar \ncommunities has no independent influence on the way in which interviewees think and \nspeak about health, medicine and illness.  \nMoreover, these proportions were scarcely greater than was found amongst waged \nminers (25 percent) and a mong all miners (24 percent), including the so -called \u2018artisan\u2019 \nminers. Even comparing these latter two sets, the figures are surprising, as Pachakutik \nendorses \u2018artisan\u2019 mining while opposing industrial -scale mining (in which waged miners \nare employed at the Mirador project) as its salient political position vis -\u00e0-vis Shuar people \nin the province of Zamora -Chinchipe. The province\u2019s Prefect (the highest -level of elected \nofficial in Ecuadorian provinces) belongs to the Pachakutik party, it should be noted, s o \nthe problem cannot be reduced to that of a marginal party without a sufficient platform \nto make its view known. As such it is difficult to comprehend the apparently low degree of 117 \n correspondence between Pachakutik\u2019s member communities and the language and  way \nof thinking associated with the party.  \nLikewise, Shuar people\u2019s position vis -\u00e0-vis the economic ideology of Pachakutik shows no \nrelationship with whether or not their perspective on health and illness and associated \nworldview is in alignment with and expressed through the themes common to \nPachakutik\u2019s discourse. In other words, Shuar people who think and speak in the same \nterms as Pachakutik are no less likely to be economically dependent on mining \n(\u2018extractivism\u2019, in the terms of Pachakutik). This rai ses the question as to the consistency \nof Pachakutik\u2019s political position against industrial -scale mining versus so -called \u2018artisan\u2019 \nmining with the rest of their discourse, at least for Shuar people, who do not appear to see \na necessary contradiction betw een working in the mining sector and the desirability of \nmaintaining their cultural independence. After all, pre - and early -colonial history suggests \nthat there is no inherent incongruence between Amazonian cultures and economic \nspecialisation, the extract ion of precious metals and large -scale trading networks \n(Whitehead, 1994: 36 -38). However, before delving into interpretation, it is time to first \ngive colour to these statistics in the form of some examples of the common types of \nresponse offered to the a bove listed questions by Shuar people of the distinct subsets \noutlined so far.  \n \nThe Discourse of Indigeneity in Interviewee Responses  \nThe Pachakutik political party was founded in 1995 as the electoral wing of Ecuador\u2019s \nlargest indigenous federation, CONA IE, as a means of channelling the support manifest in \nthe 1990 and 1994 national -level indigenous uprisings, considered landmarks in Ecuadorian 118 \n political history. From 2006 until the confirmation of the 2008 Constitution, Pachakutik \nworked closely with the  newly -elected Correa government, most notably in drafting the \nconstitutional provisions affirming collective rights and the \u2018plurinational\u2019 and \n\u2018intercultural\u2019 character of the Ecuadorian state. The party has since become opposed to \nthe ruling Alianza Pa\u00ed s government, predominately over questions related to models of \ndevelopment: where the government has supported large -scale development of \nagriculture and mining, Pachakutik generally favours small -scale production and \ndecentralised ownership. In the Ecuad orian Amazon, the party\u2019s discursive focus is \ntherefore on opposition to large -scale mining and oil projects and the defence of \nindigenous territory, often invoked in fiery rhetoric. The party also functions as an \naffirmation of indigenous identity, long d erided in Ecuador, and its pre -elections event are \nless \u2018rallies\u2019 or \u2018demonstrations\u2019 as much as they are scenes of dancing and drinking to \ntraditional styles of music which, especially in isolated areas, can turn into the biggest \nparties around.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 119 \n Figure 4 : Nangaritza Shuar travelling to a pre -election Pachakutik rally in 2014  \n \nIt has to be said, however, that while Pachakutik is in effect \u2018the indigenous party\u2019 in \nEcuador, it by no means monopolises indigenous electoral support. Although the party  \ncontrols the provincial government in Zamora -Chinchipe, the Correa government won a \ngreater share than Pachakutik of the vote in most indigenous -majority areas across the \ncountry in the 2013 presidential and legislative elections (S\u00e1nchez Parga, 2013). As  this \npresent research makes clear, the common cultural inheritance shared by members of \nindigenous groups and affirmed by the Pachakutik party is just one aspect of indigenous \nindividuals\u2019 worldviews and political stances, which are shaped in multifaceted  ways.  \nConsidering the interviewees in terms of political affiliation, two of the communities (Kiim \nand Shaime) visited during the research ultimately form part of the CONAIE -PK \n120 \n confederation. The other two (Yanua and Churubia), both located in the Quimi R iver Valley, \nwere affiliated with an independent Shuar federation (FSHZCH) with mixed alliances, \nhaving supported the Correa government and the Mirador gold and copper mine (under \nthe moniker of \u2018miner\u00eda responsable\u2019 [\u2018responsible mining\u2019], a commonly -invo ked phrase \nin Ecuadorian politics), before participating in anti -government protests in June 2014, \nwhich were directed against the government\u2019s mining and water laws. The cultural \nrevivalist discourse distinctive of the CONAIE -PK movement was particularly notable in \nKiim, a town which during my stay hosted a visit from dignitaries from the PK -controlled \nprovincial government to mark the occasion of an annual Shuar festival which is now no \nlonger widely celebrated. At the time of my research Kiim was the hom e community of the \nPresident of the PK -affiliated Shuar federation in the province (FEPNASH -ZCH). When the \nthen President stepped down in 2013, his wife became the organisation\u2019s Vice -President. \nHaving said that, the PK -linked themes that were so central t o interviewees\u2019 discourse in \nKiim were also evident in the interviews recorded elsewhere.  \nInterviewees\u2019 responses were classified as expressive of PK discourse when they \ndemonstrated one of a few attributes. This discourse is characterised by the theme of \nindigenous cultural revival, and this can take the form of an invocation of an idealised past \nprior to colonial contact, the denigration of the ways of life brought by that contact, and \noften both elements together. Shuar people often illustrate their perc eption of present -\nday corruption and decay in indigenous society via comparison with the ways of life of their \nancestors; or just as often, with the state of other Amazonian peoples living in more \nremote regions: usually the Achuar, or the Jivaroan groups living on the other side of \nZamora -Chinchipe\u2019s border with Peru (composed of the Shuar, Aguaruna [\u2018awajunes\u2019] and \nHuambisa [\u2018wampis\u2019] peoples), an area much more remote from its own country\u2019s centres 121 \n of political -economy gravity than Zamora -Chinchipe is fr om those in Ecuador. The point is \nnot that these interviewees simply valued or wished to recuperate characteristically Shuar \npractices, but rather than their thinking was informed by an idealisation of pre -contact \nsociety shared with an influential, nation -wide political discourse.  \nThe meme of historical revival is especially striking in light of the lack of importance \nattributed to history by Jivaroan peoples noted by past ethnographers. Philippe Descola \nand Anne -Christine Taylor, ethnographers who some fo rty years ago conducted research \napproximately 300km to the north of my own research area and within the same linguistic \nfamily, reported \u2018[t]he remarkable indifference that the Achuar display towards the past \n[\u2026] they get along very well without a histori cal memory, all recall of events that affected \nearlier generations being carefully erased by their spontaneous forgetfulness\u2019 (Descola, \n1996: 223). In a regional study, Taylor noted than non -missionised, north -west Amazonians \n\u2018do not have any specific genr e of historical discourse; in fact history as we understand it \n[\u2026] is surprisingly absent from indigenous discursive forms\u2019 (1999: 237). This clearly recent \nemphasis on indigenous history, then, should be conceptualised as exemplary of the \ninternationalisa tion of indigenous rights discourse and its permeation \u2013as the present \nstudy makes clear \u2013of even some of the remotest and most autonomous indigenous \nterritories (see also Jackson, 1994; Ramos, 1994). In its Ecuadorian permutation, this \ndiscourse is shaped b y primarily Kichwa assumptions, manifest in aspects of provincial -\nlevel governmentality under Pachakutik Prefect Salvador Quishpe, as well as elements of \nmiddle -class environmentalism associated with the MPD. These subtleties to the \nPachakutik phenomenon a nd their impact upon the health -seeking practices and \nworldview of Shuar individuals will be explored in Chapter 7.  122 \n PK discourse was easily notable in the interviews because of its ostensibly tangential \nnature, as well as the uniformity of the theme. For example, when asked about the kind of \ntreatment given by a Shuar healer who treated and cured her sick son, a Kiim woman said, \n\u2018We gave him only natural medicines, all the medicines that we cultivate as part of rescuing \nour culture.\u2019 She later said:  \nSomet imes they say that the baby needs calcium or other things so they can grow up healthy, \nbut we don\u2019t use this, we just give them natural medicines. We put chinni  on the [baby\u2019s] \nknees to make them strengthen. Nowadays, when the baby is sick they say, \u201cLet\u2019s  go to the \n\u2018subcentro\u2019 (clinic).\u201d Before, we used to make a herbal wash for the child and give \nmedications to clean out their stomach. We\u2019re rescuing these customs.  \nFrom this perspective, Shuar people are seen to be turning more towards clinical medicine \n(and other aspects of the outside world) not due to its intrinsic merits, but rather because \nof their own laziness or ignorance. In a similar vein, the previously quoted interviewee\u2019s \nsister commented dismissively, after quickly rattling off a list of more than a dozen \nmedicinal plants that she uses, \u2018[s]ome people go to the doctor even just for a stomach \npain.\u2019 This misguidedness is considered to impact upon health in a broader sense than just \nthe choice of medicines. As I was told by one of the two sisters :  \nI use ginger when I cook meat or chicken. It\u2019s better than using dressings for flavour. We don\u2019t \nknow what kind of garbage they put in those bottles. I always say, \u2018In the countryside we have \nall the food we need, because God has provided it for us.\u2019 Bu t the great laziness that we suffer \nfrom, the great laziness that kills us, is running to the store. Running to the store, instead of \nspending a little time on your land, and giving your children the food they need.  \nThe respect for traditional indigenous p ractices is coupled with a disdain for what comes \nfrom the outside world, and its impact upon Shuar people\u2019s health.  123 \n My mother -in-law says that the air and the water is much more contaminated now than it used \nto be, and that\u2019s why there is so much illness . Before they used to live without illness. Now \neven the plants are different. They put in chemicals to improve the production, so it\u2019s not \nwhat it used to be. We work here without using chemicals. We just work, using our own \nstrength we produce something healthy to feed to our children.  \nWhile PK discourse was particularly marked in Kiim, similar styles of commentary on the \nstate of health in Shuar communities were forthcoming from PK -affiliated community \nleaders in Shaime, and from others in Shaime and its  surrounds. \u00d3scar Taish, who in 2014 \nran on the Pachakutik ticket for an elected position on the council of a small Nangaritza \nmunicipality, said, \u2018We eat pasta, rice, tinned meat, and it produces illnesses. And for us \nthis is quite worrying, because every  day things are becoming more difficult.\u2019 Such \nconcerns are well -founded \u2013it has to be remembered that the western -style food that does \nreach these remote areas tends to be very high in salt or sugar used as preservatives \u2013and \nthis perhaps helps explain why this perspective is not confined to PK -affiliated towns. \nRicardo Kayuk of Yanua in the Quimi River Valley, for example, began on the subject of \ntraditional medicine by praising the knowledge of his forefathers, before lamenting the \npractices of people toda y. \u2018We have to eat rice,\u2019 he said. \u2018And they [Shuar people generally] \nbuy \u201cpollos cubanos\u201d [the breed of chooks raised in commercial operations], which are \njust swollen up with lots of chemicals, and then make a stew. That\u2019s why we are so sick all \nthe time , with all the sicknesses that there are. We consume so much sugar as well.\u2019  \nA final aspect of Pachakutik discourse evident in interviewees\u2019 responses was the \nconceptualisation of healing practices indigenous to Shuar people as part of \u2018culture.\u2019 An \nexampl e was a teacher in the formerly PK -controlled Directorate of Bilingual and \nIntercultural Education, who responded to a question about whether he would teach his 124 \n knowledge of medicinal plants to his children by saying, \u2018Now, currently, because \neducation has  been advancing, the youth do not place much importance on culture.\u2019 The \nimplication is that students are somehow escaping from what is cultural in being taught a \ncertain set of (non -Shuar) norms. This involves a curious assimilation of a foreign \nconceptua lisation of one\u2019s own practice, instead of seeing it as a self -evident enactment \nof knowledge. While a degree of self -reflexivity is inevitable in any engagement with the \noutside, the notion of \u2018culture\u2019 in modern western ontology sets up a dangerous \nasymm etry between a peculiarity to be examined and assessed, on one side; and on the \nother, a set of universals exempt from the same scrutiny. Philippe Descola sums up its \nimplications as follows:  \n[T]he problem is that we do not conceive of cultures as complet e systems of cosmology \n(worldview), ontology and epistemology. As Roy Wagner puts it, anthropologists working \nwith the nature/culture division as an assumption do not consider that non -western cultures \n\u2018contrast with our culture or offer counter -examples t o it, as a total system of \nconceptualization; but rather, invite comparison as \u201cother ways\u201d of dealing with our own \nreality \u2019 (2013b: 81, emphasis in original).37 \nSuch interviewee responses leave us with several questions to resolve if we are to \ncomprehend s tate healthcare and indigenous health -seeking practice in the context of \nPachakutik and the broader discourse of indigenous culture. What are the contradictions \nof advocating for intercultural health via the notion of cultural rights? How can Pachakutik \nface these contradictions as a party operating within an international framework of \nindigenous rights? What language and processes can the Ecuadorian state adopt if it seeks \n                                                        \n37 The citation of Wagner is drawn from The Invention of Culture (1981: 142).  125 \n to build healthcare as a branch of the \u2018intercultural and plurinational state\u2019 that is \nresponsive to the worldview of its citizens, whoever they may be? Before these questions \ncan be answered, however, we have to begin to understand the nature of Shuar health -\nseeking practices and the intracultural diversity which characterises the range of its \nexpressions.  \n \nHealth -Seeking Practices of Shuar Evangelicals  \nThe position of twenty -first century Shuar people can be characterised as one of partial \nconquest, and this is reflected in their religious convictions. Like the majority of \nEcuadorians, most Shuar people I met consider themselves Catholic. Yet their Catholicism \ntends to be idiosyncratic and syncretic to a point that would scandalise most of the world\u2019s \nGod -fearing Christians. One suspects that it is an open question as to who was being \nconverted more between the Shuar and the pioneering Franciscans. Contrary to the \nstereotype of fanatics preaching fire an d brimstone to any savage who persisted in pagan \nworship, the Catholic missionaries, at least, seem to have been surprisingly conciliatory. \nPerhaps they had no other option. In a revealing essay, James Boster (2003) shows that \nthe indigenous notion of Ar\u00fat am was transposed by missionaries to their own notion of \nGod as if the two were equivalent. Missionaries taught that the diverse figures from Shuar \nmythology were \u2018hypostases\u2019 of the Holy Spirit (Boster, 2003: 170 -1), and that the visions \nthey encountered by fasting, hiking to waterfalls and consuming psychoactive plants, \nwhich they knew as Ar\u00fatam , were themselves manifestations of God. This was the \nperspective held by a mission -educated Shuar man in Nangaritza who in 2014 told me, \n\u2018Ar\u00fatam  is God himself. T here\u2019s no way to draw distinctions between them. In Shuar, it\u2019s 126 \n Ar\u00fatam  and in Spanish it\u2019s God.\u2019 This perception of equivalence appears to be the logical \noutcome of the Catholics\u2019 proselytising strategy. The influential Salesian missionary Siro \nPellizarro,  who published numerous volumes on Shuar mythology while adjusting them to \nhis own theological interpretations, argued that \u2018a colonizing Christianization which \ndestroys mythic traditions instead of valuing them and purifying them will not improve the \nShua r people\u2019 (quoted in Boster, 2003: 170). Shuar Catholics, then, are a people half -\nconverted: they see murder and polygamy as evidence of sin instead of strength, but have \nno moral compunction against consuming powerful psychoactive plants as a form of \npers onal spiritual practice.  \nProtestant Evangelism first entered this milieu with the founding of the Gospel Missionary \nUnion mission at Makuma, Morona -Santiago in 1976. Evangelism has since spread \nthroughout Shuar country via interfamilial connections, with i ts most ardent adherents \nworking with crusading fervour but marginal impact. Their religiosity is grounded in a \n\u2018midwestern and southern U.S. fundamentalism\u2019 (Taylor, 1981: 669) that prohibits \nfollowers from involvement in any kind of \u2018drunkenness,\u2019 which is interpreted to include \nthe effects of ayahuasca, datura, tobacco and chicha, as well as the beer and \u2018aguardiente\u2019  \n(sugar -cane liquor) obtained from mestizo society. The visions seen by consuming native \npsychoactive plants are referred to by Evangelical s as \u2018Satanic\u2019 or \u2018false.\u2019 Evangelicals also \noppose any involvement with shamans, who they consider as consorting with Satan \nthrough their visionary practice. Evangelical religious beliefs are evidently a strong \npredictor of health -seeking behaviour and wo rldview in light of the uniformity of \nresponses from the interviewees, which was greater for this group than for any other. \nWith regard to the Evangelical cohort, there was a total of ten interviewees, seeven of \nwhom lived in Shaime and its surrounds and t hree of whom lived in Churubia in the Quimi 127 \n River Valley. The most distinctive features of Evangelicals\u2019 health -seeking practices were \nthe rejection of psychoactive plants; the related rejection of the validity of shamanic \ntreatments, which typically requi re shamans to consume these plants; and a general \npragmatism between respect for herbal medicine and a willingness to seek out treatments \nat medical clinics.  \nTable 8: Health -seeking practices of Shuar Evangelicals  \n YES NO AMBIGUOUS  \nPrefer clinical to herbal \nmedicine?  5 (50%)  2 (20%)  3 (30%)  \nUse of or trust in shamanic \ntreatments?  0 9 (90%)  1 (10%)  \nAttach importance to \n(Evangelical) visionary \npractices?  3 (30%)  7 (70%)  0 \nUse of or trust in \npsychoactive plants?  0 9 (90%)  1 (10%)  \n \nOf the three interviewees from the Quimi River Valley, the two men claimed to know \nnothing specific about medicinal plants and their uses. The third lamented, in our \ninterview, that she had not been taught about medicinal plants by her parents; she said \nthat both for serious illnesses or injuries and for everyday fevers and colds suffered by her \nchildren, the nearby clinic in the town of Tundayme was her first resort. By the same token, \nshe had evidently developed a degree of knowledge on the subject of m edicinal plants on 128 \n an ad hoc basis. She described, for example, using a certain plant to stem the bleeding \nwhen her brother was seriously wounded. She also gave scrapings of datura to a friend \nwho had returned from hospital after being treated for a broken  bone, but was still \nsuffering from the pain and swelling caused by her injury. Regardless of the degree of \nknowledge they possessed on the subject, eight of the nine Evangelicals interviewed \nagreed on the value of treatments based on medicinal plants; the  opinions of the ninth, an \nelderly man from Churubia, were difficult to gauge, as he considered medicinal plants the \nterrain of women.  \nThe rejection of shamans and the hallucinogenic plants that are the visionary tools of the \nshamans\u2019 trade (but also have  a social life outside of shamanism and healing) was the \nEvangelical group\u2019s strongest predilection. Where many other Shuar people noted the \nvalue they place on the visionary experience obtained via ayahuasca, datura and tobacco, \nall of the Evangelical men  except two specifically commented that they no longer consume \nthese plants since their conversion to the Evangelical sect. One of the other men was \nnotably hesitant before finally denying that he had ever touched these plants as an \nadolescent before conve rting to Evangelism. The second offered only a short interview \nthat did not touch upon the matter; he was intimidated by the interview process and \nseemed to have a limited capacity to express himself.  \nThe power of religious conversion to wipe out tradition al vision -seeking practice seems to \nbe present even in the case of those raised in a traditional Shuar manner. This became clear \nwhen interviewing the old man who was the head of the family in Churubia. When pressed \nabout why he had drunk ayahuasca and dat ura, he replied:  129 \n My grandfather used to give it to me, to make me strong, make me grow up, make me a \nman. That\u2019s why the old ones would give it [\u2026] I drank it as part of our custom, to make you \nlive well and for a long time. I don\u2019t drink it now that I\u2019m a n Evangelical. It makes you drunk, \n\u2018emborracha fe\u00edsimo.\u2019 Getting drunk is a sin, they say.  \nIn similar fashion, a middle -aged Evangelical Shuar preacher visiting Shaime during my time \nthere said, \u2018I remember that before, before I left this behind, I used t o drink  nat\u00e9m . We \ndrank it in order to receive strength, and to encounter a vision so that we would be able \nto keep on living for a long time.\u2019 Another described the multiple times he drank ayahuasca \nand datura (separately from each other!) as \u2018a very impo rtant experience. There one sees \nvisions, the vision that one may see, of one\u2019s home, of gaining more experience and \nknowledge from a young age.\u2019 When asked whether he would continue drinking \nconcoctions of these plants today, he replied, \u2018Well, learning t he word of God one has to \nleave these things, these demonic things.\u2019 This is not a case, then, of Evangelical norms \nslowly eroding away any consciousness of past practices, but rather a specific and \naggressive normative clash in which the Evangelical side has gained traction among some \nShuar in the region. That is not to say that Evangelicals were willing to deny or belittle the \nimportance of visions, dreams and altered states of consciousness during episodes of \nillness, or in life more broadly. The preache r described his conversion experience as a vision \nof being healed by angels while in a delirium brought on by illness; likewise, the Evangelical \ngrandmother said that God could visit the faithful in dreams to heal them. As will be \ndiscussed in Chapter 5, E vangelisation brings not an abandonment of Shuar people\u2019s \nattachment to the significance of invisible realities, but rather a modulation of its rules of \nengagement and a changed dynamic of spiritual hierarchy and subjugation.  130 \n Of the four Evangelical women , three of them excoriated the practice of drinking \nhallucinogenic plants. The fourth simply had no exposure to such plants in her youth and \ndid not mention any desire to try them. Only one of the women admitted to previous \nexperiences with the plants befo re distancing herself from them based on her present \nbeliefs. A lesser prevalence of use of hallucinogenic plants among Shuar women \u2013or a \nlesser desire to proclaim having had the experience \u2013is consistent with the notion put \nforward by Anne -Christine Taylor that \u2018being an exemplary Jivaroan [is] a male \nprerogative\u2019 (2014: 97). In light of this, and in a society like that of Shuar people, without \nformalised clans, religious rules or ritual structures, it is logical that this emblematic rite of \npassage would be  more commonly foisted upon young men than on young women.  \nOnly one of the Evangelicals (the Shaime man who was most reticent in expressing his \nideas) would go to a shaman for treatment. The two brothers following the Evangelical \nfaith described shamans a s \u2018Satanic\u2019 and \u2018working with the Devil.\u2019 Both also emphasised \nthe idea that shamans lie about their ability to heal in order to deceive people into paying \nthem extortionate sums for treatment. In fact, for these two it was perhaps less the \nscriptural proh ibitions and moreso the direct experience of being deceived by charlatans \nthat was the more operative in their religious conversions, as the daughter of one of the \nmen died despite her father pouring time and resources into her receiving treatments from \nvarious shamans. Put another way, one could say that it was this life experience which \nallowed the Evangelical norms to resonate with these men. The preacher, by contrast, \nmade little reference to personal experience, simply describing shamans in conceptual \nterms as \u2018an abomination.\u2019 He also said that the ayahuasca experience is to be condemned \nbecause its hallucinations are \u2018a Satanic vision.\u2019 In Churubia, the old man described \nshamans as \u2018liars,\u2019 and the other two said that visiting shamans is \u2018prohibited.\u2019  131 \n On a final point, the preference held by Evangelicals between clinical medicine and herbal -\nplant treatments \u2013their only alternative treatment option due to the generalised rejection \nof shamanism \u2013was mixed. For the three residents of Churubia, despite some amateur \nknowledge about medicinal plants, clinical medicine was clearly their primary remedy in \nthe case of illness or injury. In Shaime, however, there was marked suspicion and even \nhostility to medical clinics among some interviewees. One of the brothers  argued that \nclinical medicines are \u2018simply a business\u2019 and suggested that injections and serums are \nused by medical personnel (and on a more general level, the state) to kill off indigenous \npeople. He contrasted clinical and hospital care harshly with tra ditional lifeways in a style \nreminiscent of the cultural revivalist discourse characteristic of the Pachakutik party. \nOthers were happy to vacillate in their preference between clinical and herbal medicine. \nOne Shaime man criticised pharmaceuticals for bei ng \u2018chemical\u2019 and \u2018sedatives,\u2019 but \nadmitted to using them in certain cases. For him, whatever the medicine, the key element \nwas prayer and faith in God. The grandmother made a similar point, calling clinical \nmedicines \u2018sedatives\u2019 which only provide tempora ry respite, and preferred medicinal plant \nuse in combination with prayer, fasting, faith and correct moral conduct. As for the \nEvangelical preacher and his wife, they commented that they trusted clinical medicine and \nhad seen good results with it. Two of t heir four children had been born in hospital, which \nis rare among residents of the region. Finally, the former \u2018magia\u2019  practitioner and \nEvangelical convert Martina was entirely pragmatic when asked for a preference between \nclinical and herbal medicine.  \n \n 132 \n Geographic Isolation and Traditional Ontology in Shuar Healing  \nIn the case of the province of Zamora -Chinchipe, to speak of Shuar living in remote areas \nis to speak of the Upper Nangaritza River Basin. While there are communally -titled Shuar \nsettlements sur prisingly close to regional cities, Alto Nangaritza  is the one area of the \nprovince where Shuar settlement predominates. To the gringo  traveller apparently \ninterested in learning about \u2018Shuar culture\u2019, mestizo  townspeople in Zamora were quick to \nurge a trip to Nangaritza: \u2018all\u00e1 es puro Shuar\u2019 (\u2018It\u2019s 100% Shuar there\u2019). At times one notices \na strange mixture of admiration and resentment for their indigenous compatriots amongst \nmestizo  Ecuadorians, especially in the Oriente (the eastern, rainforested half of Ecuador). \nIt is not unusual to hear sentiments similar to those of the Zamora resident who told me \nabout the Nangaritza Shuar, \u2018They are very racist. They don\u2019t want anything to do with us.\u2019 \nSuch comments coexist alongside baldly discriminatory jokes th at one needs to be wary \nof being turned into a shrunken -head or a bowl of soup.  \nArriving in Shaime, however, it is evident that the local Shuar people have historically been \nquite willing to have \u2018something to do with\u2019 outsiders, perhaps more so than nowa days. \nLike other Shuar towns in the province, Shaime is a collection of owner -built houses \nconstructed from machine -sawed timber boards and raised above clay earth denuded of \nvegetation. At some point in their history, the area\u2019s inhabitants were induced t o come \ntogether to build a church and concentrate their dwellings in a small village, the better to \nattend church and approximate the appearance of a devout European congregation. The \nstrategy creates its own complications for a people who previously had l ived dispersed \nthrough the forest, with each household having its own supply of freshwater and forest \ngame. The latter must have been much more accessible, being forced to navigate their 133 \n way between houses rather than, as is currently the case, being able to simply give a wide \nberth to a single great concentration of armed Shuar men, which is what Shaime \nrepresents to them.  \nAs has been detailed, the Catholic missionaries were only partly successful in remaking \nShuar individuals\u2019 worldviews in their own ima ge. Aside from the small group of \nEvangelicals, Catholicism is a given, yet the relevance of sorcery, shamanic healing and \naltered states of consciousness arrived at under the influence of psychoactive plants was \nalso immediately obvious in the interviews.  Shamanism was considered more important \nto residents of remote areas than to any other interviewees. However, rather than \noperating a sort of alternate \u2018medical system\u2019 to the clinical healthcare provided by the \nstate, shamans are considered essential onl y for a very specific purpose: curing illness \ncaused by the sorcery of other shamans. The product of this bewitching is usually referred \nto in an indirect way, commonly as \u2018maldad\u2019 (\u2018bad/evil thing\u2019) or \u2018da\u00f1o\u2019  (\u2018harm/damage\u2019). \nSuch an illness is not amenab le to being treated by anyone other than a shaman, but it may \nnot immediately betray this characteristic. Shaime resident Walter Wampash explained \nthat sorcery may initially appear \u2018in the style of\u2019 (\u2018al estilo de\u2019) a common illness, like \n\u2018diarrhoea, heada che, fever, or some sort of insanity [sic].\u2019 However, because it is actually \ngenerated by a shaman, it can only be cured by a shaman; conversely, a shaman does not \ncure diseases that arise in the normal course of life:  \n\u2013 So an  uwishin  does not cure illness es that arise in and of themselves?  \n\u2013 No. These are not cured by the uwishin . They are cured by western medicines or natural \nmedicines.  134 \n The notion of \u2018maldad\u2019  appears related to but should be distinguished from Mediterranean \nfolk beliefs surrounding envy a nd the evil eye (\u2018mal ojo\u2019; see Idoyaga Molina, 2016). \nWhereas the latter trace the origin of illness to the envious or resentful gaze of a fellow \nhuman being, the concept of \u2018maldad\u2019  as found among Shuar people is tied exclusively to \nthe role of shamans. As Martina Tukupi of Shaime replied, when asked if ordinary people\u2019s \nenvy could make others sick, \u2018It\u2019s only with sorcery. One would have to be a shaman. \nRegular, free, clean people \u2013 no.\u2019 That is not to say that there is no cross -over between \nindigenous A mazonian and folk Hispanic ideas, which can be found quite broadly \nthroughout Ecuadorian society and especially in rural areas. Interviewees would \nsometimes reference the cause of an episode of illness as the \u2018envy\u2019 of such -and-such a \nneighbour, or refer t o a sick person as having been \u2018ojeado\u2019 (\u2018evil -eyed\u2019); however on \nfurther discussion, this would be hypothesised as having been actualised by contracting a \nshaman, who was the one to execute the magical attack. Similarly, many Shuar people \naccept the idea that \u2018maldad\u2019  can be diagnosed by passing an egg over the body of a sick \nperson, then cracking the egg into a glass of water and examining the yolk. This practice, \nvariants of which are common in mestizo  society throughout the Americas (Casta\u00f1eda, \n1971: 30 6; Idoyaga Molina, 2006: 93; L\u00f3pez, 2005: 26; Moss, 2014: 333), presumably arose \nat some point in the Mediterranean world\u2019s long history of raising chickens for eggs, which \nis a relatively recently adopted practice among Shuar people.  \nThe functionality of \u2018maldad\u2019  explains why the most common preference in health -seeking \nbehaviour in Alto Nangaritza was neither outright rejection of nor complete reliance on \nclinical medicine: for most people, each have their place, depending on the cause of the \nillness in q uestion. A popular typology was the categorisation of illness according to its \ncause as either \u2018enfermedad de Dios\u2019 (\u2018sickness of God\u2019, meaning \u2018naturally -occurring\u2019) or 135 \n \u2018enfermedad del hombre\u2019 (\u2018sickness of man\u2019; in other words, a sickness caused by a spe cific \nperson). At this simplistic level of analysis \u2013which presumes that diseases can be \nunderstood as universally consistent phenomena independent of the afflicted individual in \nquestion \u2013the dichotomy mirrors research on traditional medicine that is wont t o describe \nlocal aetiologies as dividing between the \u2018naturalistic\u2019 or \u2018personalistic\u2019 (Green, 1999: 15), \nas detailed in Chapter 1. To this, many Shuar people add the complication that an ordinary \nherbal or clinical treatment in fact makes a shamanically d erived illness worse. This \nconceptualisation of \u2018maldad\u2019  and its relationship with other illness was most articulately \nexpressed by Byron, a young man from Shaime:  \nWhen it is \u2018enfermedad de Dios\u2019, then just pills and traditional medicines is enough. When a \nperson has done \u2018da\u00f1o\u2019 against you, no matter how many pills and medicines you take, you \nwon\u2019t get better. Say you get an injection, it will just make you worse. For this reason, first \nyou have to consult the uwishin . \nThe idea that herbal or clinical tre atments may make an illness worse was also expressed \nby Ximena, a middle -aged woman from Shaime. Sorcery, she said, \u2018isn\u2019t something that can \njust be cured like that, with a remedy or an injection, because it goes against these things.\u2019 \nThis was part of th e more general notion, expressed by the elder woman Dolores, that \nmedicines can be \u2018jealous\u2019 and that employing more than one kind is harmful because they \n\u2018go against one another\u2019 (\u2018se va contra\u2019 [sic]). This same notion that personalistic illness \ncannot b e cured by pharmaceutical medicine, and may actually be made worse because of \n\u2018jealousy\u2019, has been documented among mothers on the Colombian Pacific coast (Delgado \net. al., 2006: 249). However, it contrasts with the findings of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kelly, who \nemph asises \u2018the complementarity of biomedicine and shamanism\u2019 for the Venezuelan \nYanomami (2011: 141). Both Yanomami and Shuar people\u2019s ancestral cultures include an 136 \n \u2018etiology  that  conceives  of  most  illnesses  as  an  aggression  on  a  person\u2019s ontologic al \naspects (souls or vital images) by human or non -human agents,\u2019 such that \u2018shamanism \noperates in the sphere of causes (aggressors), biomedicine in the sphere of effects \n(symptoms)(Kelly, 2011: 141). Yanomami, however, appear not to contemplate the \npossib ility of \u2018jealousy\u2019 between types of illnesses and their attendant remedies that \nmakes correct diagnosis via an uwishin  so important for Shuar people.  \nOf course, this style of reasoning, where the efficacy of treatments attempted is used to \nexplain the ori ginal cause of an illness, lends itself to perpetuating explanations that \nemploy the notion of \u2018maldad\u2019. A good example was put forward by Roberto from Alto \nNangaritza:  \n\u2013 Let\u2019s say that right in this moment I feel bad and I have an illness that can\u2019t be c ured by \npills or other medicines. That\u2019s the signal. If it doesn\u2019t respond, we know to go to an uwishin  \nand seek out a treatment. Then the uwishin  will drink nat\u00e9m  and examine you and say, \u2018No, \nthis isn\u2019t an illness that could just happen to anyone. This i llness is from a person \u2018que te ha \nhecho  da\u00f1o\u2019 (\u2018who has done you harm\u2019). From then, the uwishin  can heal you and make you \nfeel free of it.  \n\u2013 Ok, so the uwishin  is specifically for illnesses that have been caused by another person?  \n\u2013 Yes, and he can take a way the \u2018males\u2019 that another person has done to you.  \nThe same mode of understanding was expressed by Ximena Charip, from Churubia on the \nother side of the province:  \n\u2013 Is it difficult at times to tell between something that a doctor can cure and something that \na shaman can cure?  \n\u2013 You have to see. If the illness is cured straightaway by a doctor, then it\u2019s an illness that was \nput there by God. Then if it\u2019s not cured by the doctor and the medicines from the hospital, 137 \n but instead it gets to work [sic], then y ou know that it\u2019s not a sickness for that. Then we have \nto seek out a shaman who can cure the person. If the shaman cures the person, that\u2019s how \nyou know what it was.  \nThis same logic of interpretation was attested to among the Achuar by Descola some forty \nyears ago when he noted that shamanically derived illness \u2018is recognisable not from its \nsymptoms but from its resistance to non -shamanistic techniques of healing\u2019 (199 6: 236). It \nalso mirrors common procedures for diagnosing illness as produced by sorcery in mestizo \nsociety (e.g. Ramos Cordoba, 2011: 125). Whether people turn first to herbal or clinical \nmedical treatments, shamanism will remain a popular way to explain any situation where \na person cannot be cured by other available means and falls through the cracks, so to \nspeak, of the other models of illness and healing.  \nThis indigenous conception of sorcery is a central reason explaining why few Shuar in \nremote regio ns of Zamora -Chinchipe rely exclusively on clinical medicine. A further factor \nhas, however, more to do with the nature of clinical care in the region. The medicines \nprovided by clinicians in the Shaime clinic, which attends to Shuar people from all of the  \nUpper Nangaritza Basin, were regularly criticised as simply \u2018sedatives\u2019 (\u2018calmantes\u2019) by \nlocal people. Martina from Shaime, for example, argued that the clinics \u2018give us remedies \nthat work temporarily, but they aren\u2019t really good.\u2019 An interviewee from the  same town, \nRafael, said similarly that \u2018these [medicines] are just \u201ccalmantes\u201d. They have their utility, \nbut then when the time comes one is left just the same, or worse.\u2019 Another, Ricardo, said:  \n[T]here are the medicines and the vitamins that we take fro m the pharmacy, but they\u2019re worth \nnothing to us. They don\u2019t cure us. Or if they do cure us, it\u2019s just for a while. It alieves you for a \nwhile, but within two weeks the same sickness is back. That\u2019s why to be cured, it\u2019s better for \nus to find some remedy th at we can prepare at home.  138 \n Similarly, an interviewee from Kiim said, \u2018My brother told me, \u201cIf you take that injection, it \nwill just be a \u2018calmante\u2019  and you\u2019ll wake up with the exact same problem tomorrow.\u201d\u2019 \nAltogether, the critique of clinical medicines as  \u2018calmantes\u2019 was raised by a dozen \ninterviewees in Shaime; though not entirely absent in the other areas of study, it was raised \nnowhere else with anywhere near the same prevalence.  \nThis suspicion or critique of the nature of the medicines provided at stat e-run clinics \ndovetailed with a broader sense of suspicion and occasional outright hostility on the part \nof Shuar people toward clinics, as well as the Ecuadorian state and mestizo  society. It was \na common, throw -away comment for doctors to be referred to as \u2018matasanos\u2019: that is to \nsay, \u2018killers of healthy people.\u2019 For example, when asked why his children were all born at \nhome instead of at the hospital, Antonio from Shaime replied, \u2018Well, the hospital, they just \ngive injections and use serum, and they kill  people that way. So seeing as we have our own \nproducts, we do not need to go there. Many people die at the hospital. So we don\u2019t.\u2019 \nAnother Shaime resident, Justino, said, \u2018And now, we have a government that is trying to \nexterminate us with these medicines . The government wants to give us injections so that \nwe are normalised and don\u2019t produce more children.\u2019 Ricardo, also a young man from \nShaime, said:  \nThe colonisers want to do away with the race of Shuar altogether [\u2026] So of course, when we \ngo to the hosp ital, they help us, and then they give us bad injections and bad remedies and \nbad treatments, and we don\u2019t realise because we don\u2019t know what kind of remedy it is. Sure, \nwe have some idea: \u2018This is a remedy for fever\u2019, \u2018this is a remedy for allergies,\u2019 but  we don\u2019t \nknow exactly what these products do.  139 \n Segundo was another from Shaime who connected his anti -government political \nsentiment with his preferences between clinical and traditional medicine. \u2018These \nmedicines [pharmaceuticals] are nothing,\u2019 he argued.   \nThey don\u2019t help for anything. It is like a phantasm, a drug, no, not even a drug, because a drug \nat least does something\u2026God shouldn\u2019t allow [it], but even He himself doesn\u2019t realise what \nis being done to our poor people, our poor nationality, how we ind igenous people are \ncastigated. Traditional medicines will be all gone and they\u2019ll put only their medicines.  \nOne can see here a glimpse of the way the discussion about indigenous medicine and \nintercultural health is, for many Shuar people, entirely bound up  with questions of rights \nover land use and ownership and resistance to further colonisation of their territory (see \nChapter 7). It is also, as will be discussed in Chapter 4, fundamentally entwined with the \ncapacity to use medicinal plants as part of what  we would term spiritual practices, but are \nfor many Shuar people central to their conceptualisation of the right way to live.  \nOthers\u2019 preferences were shaped by somewhat less sensational ideas, though nonetheless \nembedded in memories of profound experienc es where the stakes were life and death. \nRoberto Taish, for example, described an experience of a \u2018false positive\u2019 diagnosis \nregarding the supposedly problematic position of his unborn son. Following a prenatal \nultrasound, the doctors determined that the b irth would be fraught and requested that \nthe family relocate to the hospital in Yantzaza. However later, after a consultation with the \nmother -to-be\u2019s sister, the family decided that the doctors were mistaken. Roberto\u2019s wife \nproceeded to give birth to her f irst child without complications. Similarly, Alma Tunki\u2019s \nsuspicion of medical clinics is based on the unfavourable comparisons she makes between \nmedical and non -medical healthcare. As treatment for the liver -stones she herself suffered 140 \n and later, the gall stones suffered by her father, doctors proposed surgery. This option was \nrejected because of the horror felt by the patients and their families regarding the idea of \nhaving their bodies cut by doctors, along with a significant dose of skepticism toward \nmes tizo  society.  \nWe didn\u2019t want it to happen. So all of us, his children, met and decided to tell the doctor not \nto. They just wanted to do it to learn and be able to graduate in their studies, these \napprentices. We are not going to obey. We\u2019ll tell them no.  \nIn both cases, the patients were able to find relief outside the biomedical system. Alma \nwas treated with a herbal preparation by an uwishin , while her father was cured with a \nmedicine provided by a herbalist based in a nearby town. In a context where the  legitimacy \nof biomedicine as an explanatory model is already highly contested, such experiences can \nlead to outright rejection of clinical treatment in favour of other options in future.  \nFinally, the Upper Nangaritza River Basin was the region where the perceived importance \nof traditional practices of vision -seeking was most evident. The practice of ingesting \npowerfully psychoactive plants \u2013and the importance attributed to the practice \u2013is \nprofound enough to resist easy categorisation with the language we h ave at our disposal. \nSome interviewees spoke of it directly as a ritual of empowerment. Bol\u00edvar Chumpi, from \nShaime, described to me the qualities of datura, oft -remarked upon by Shuar people \nthrough the province, as a poultice for treating broken bones an d similar injuries. He then \ncommented:  \nEven if nothing is broken, it can be drunk, in order to see visions, to be able to see what luck \nwe are going to have, or if we are going to have luck or not, and in order to have more power 141 \n and strength. For this re ason, we fast for three days, and then we drink it. One goes to the \nwaterfall each morning.  \nFor others, such plants were spoken of as akin to a therapeutic tool that provided insight \ninto personal problems, leading to both emotional resolution and resolve regarding the \nsteps necessary to face such problems. In this sense, Shuar people\u2019s use of hallucinogenic \nplants mirrors the paradigm of psychedelic drug -assisted psychotherapy advocated by the \nMultidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), p articularly in the treatment \nof addiction (e.g. Halpern, 1996; Mangini, 1998). In a similar vein, many young people and \nparents testified to the significance of visionary experience for adolescents in order that \nthey might mature into a sense of purpose an d dynamism in life; or else the practice could \nbe viewed as providing a key to attaining knowledge in the most general sense. As the \ngrandmother Alma Tunki said:  \n\u2013 Yes, that as well. The visions. It helps you to see. One sees everything. It shows you if y ou \nare going to get sick. It shows you everything in visions, the positives and the negatives.  \n\u2013 In your life, in your relationships?  \n\u2013 In everything. How we\u2019re sharing our relationships, what work needs to be done, \neverything.  \nThis complex of ideas about  psychedelic visions involving knowledge, health, strength, \nself-development, destiny and socialisation will be elaborated upon in the following \nchapter. By documenting this practice as the most profound example of ontological \ndifference among Shuar people  in Zamora -Chinchipe, we can understand both the need \nfor interculturality in state institutions, as well as attempt to find what (if any) common \nground there may be with the purview of public health as understood in the western \nnation -state system.  142 \n Mining  and Materialism in Healthcare in the Quimi River Valley  \nBoth the physical and the socio -economic landscape in the Quimi River Valley are marked \nby the Mirador gold and copper project, a large -scale mining operation expected to \nproduce some 208,000 tonnes of copper ore and 535,500 ounces of gold over 17 years, \nworth an estimated total of USD $10.6 billion. The company operating the mine is called \nEcuaCorriente (ECSA), which since 2010 has been owned jointly by the China Railway \nConstruction Corporation and Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group, both Chinese state -\nowned companies (Sacher, 2011: 9 -13). Alongside this economic opportunity, however, is \nthe threat of industrial -scale contamination of the watershed, which has generated \nvehement opposition to the mine a mongst some. That said, waged miners were present \nin both of the valley\u2019s two Shuar towns \u2013Yanua and Churubia \u2013and several others who did \nnot work for \u2018the company\u2019 carried out their own, small -scale gold mining operations. Of \nthe twenty -eight people I was a ble to interview in the Quimi River Valley, twelve were \nwaged miners and another five were small -scale, so -called \u2018artisan\u201938 miners.  \nAlthough the desirability for humanity of industrial -scale mining in the Amazon Basin is \nhighly questionable, the support f or the Mirador mine among many Shuar locals (and the \nEcuadorian state) is not hard to understand. Of the Shuar people within the purview of \nthis study, the residents of the Quimi River Valley near the Mirador gold and copper mine \nhad opportunities for wage d labour most readily available. The miners were employed on \n                                                        \n38 \u2018Artisan\u2019 miners wor k independently, using machinery that can be moved by just a few people to \u2018wash\u2019 \nsoil on river -banks and hillsides in search of gold. The practice is politically contentious, supported by \nPachakutik but prohibited by the central government, which highligh ts environmental damage from the \nalleged use of mercury by \u2018artisan\u2019 miners. In November 2013, an attempt by the Ecuadorian military to shut \ndown illegal mining on a river near Gualaquiza triggered a firefight resulting in the death of a Shuar man \nand inju ries to nine of the ten soldiers on patrol (Hoy, 2013). The political heat of the debate stems also \nfrom the tragic death of over 300 people following a landslide at an unregulated mine site near Zamora on \n10 May 1993 (Torres T., 2004: 278).  143 \n a 15 days -on/15 days -off schedule, for which they were paid USD $480 according to one \ninterviewee, some 40 percent above the national monthly minimum wage ($340) in \nEcuador in 2014. This makes fo r a very favourable economic situation for the local miners: \nliving on ancestral land, they are not obliged to pay rent; they have plenty of days free to \ncontribute to clearing land for and maintaining the gardens where women grow the food \nto feed their fa milies; and many also spend their free 15 days in \u2018artisan\u2019 mining operations \nfor further income. By contrast, Shuar people living in Alto Nangaritza would work for \nseveral months to grow a harvest of several sacks of \u2018naranjilla,\u2019 which sell for $40 each,  or \nturn to logging or raising cattle to generate the cash they need for clothing, cartridges and \nbuilding materials.  \nIn marked contrast to the ideas and experiences that were the currency of everyday \nconversation in the Upper Nangaritza Valley, many of t he Shuar people engaged in mining \nin the Quimi River Valley spoke in common -sense terms easily recognisable to a western \nobserver. Common sense, of course, is one of the most maligned notions in the discipline \nof anthropology, such that the very fact of th e prevalence of a western style of common \nsense among the Shuar people of this region constitutes the core of the problem for \ndiscussion here and in Chapter 6. When I asked Mateo of Churubia, for example, about his \nand his family\u2019s actions in responding to  illness, he replied:  \nOf course, when it comes to sickness, I am affiliated to social security and when my children \nare ill, I take them for medical attention. They\u2019ve attended to us well there. We haven\u2019t had \nany problems. [\u2026] As you know, all the hospit als and medicines are free. This is what I can tell \nyou. Before, my ancestors used to cure themselves, let\u2019s say, when they suffered a snakebite; \nthey had many medicines that they applied.   144 \n In other words, it was perceived as the obvious, responsible thing to do to take one\u2019s \nchildren for \u2018medical attention,\u2019 and it was taken as a given that this meant the local \nhospitals and clinics. Reference is then made, in the imperfect tense, to herbal medicine as \nsomething that the ancestors once did. This was t he most common perception of \nmedicinal plants: as a desirable practice, as something that worked, but also as something \nthat has been left behind and a subject about which only one of the waged miners \ninterviewed claimed to be knowledgeable.  \nOn the subject of shamanic healing, it was normal to hear dismissals of the practice, paired \nwith minimal interest in the question. As an example, Norma from Churubia said the \nfollowing:  \n\u2013 I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve ever been to see a shaman, maybe for yours elf or for treating your \nkids? For \u2018mal aire\u2019, let\u2019s say, or some \u2018maldad\u2019, or envy?  \n\u2013 No. To be perfectly honest, I\u2019ve never believed in such things in my life: cleansings, all that. \nSo I have never been; neither myself nor my husband.  \n\u2013 Ok, well I was j ust asking because many people mention these things in other towns.  \n\u2013 No. For whatever problem we may have, first we always go to the clinic in Tundayme.  \nSimilarly, a young man from Yanua employed at the mine said, \u2018I\u2019ve never been one to do \nthis,\u2019 when as ked if he had ever taken his young children for treatment from a shaman. A \nvariation was the response from Mateo, who explicitly said, \u2018We don\u2019t have this belief.\u2019 \nLater, however, his refusal to give credence to shamans appeared to be more based on his \ndismissal of his own generation\u2019s knowledge. When asked about the existence of shamans \nwho were able to cure, he replied, \u2018Not in this area any longer. Shaman shaman [i.e. true \nshaman], there\u2019s nothing of that here anymore. I mean, you hear them putting ads o n the \nradio.\u2019 As will be discussed in Chapter 6, the explicit dismissals of ancestral knowledge by 145 \n Shuar residents of the Quimi River Valley suggests that the interplay of cultural inheritance \nand cultural vectors has produced a complex politics of belief and disbelief.  \nWith regard to vision -seeking via altered states of consciousness, those who had pursued \nthe practice mostly did so purely out of curiosity. Compared with people in Nangaritza, \nthere seemed to be less of a will or capacity to contextualise t he practice and experience \nwithin a broader universe of meaning, or even as a personal touchstone for \ncomprehending one\u2019s own life questions. Revealing in this regard was the reference to \nvisions as being like \u2018watching a movie,\u2019 or one man\u2019s desire to try  drinking ayahuasca \nbecause his \u2018grandfather used to say that in his visions he saw lots of women.\u2019 At the same \ntime, the danger here is to contrast these people\u2019s thoughts with an imagined past where \nShuar knowledge was treated as pure and sacred. After a ll, traditional ethnography\u2019s \nfixation on cultural homogeneity could have easily precluded such profane sentiments as \nyoung men\u2019s appreciation of pornographic visions from reaching final publications, in \npreference for the more refined and professional kno wledge expressed by shamanic \nspecialists. For the moment, the point here is simply that while belief in shamans and \nvision -seeking among Shuar people in the Quimi River Valley was far from the generalised \nacceptance observable in Nangaritza, it should also  not be characterised as a case of \nsimple assimilation into the kind of materialism associated with secular rationalism in the \nwestern world.  \nAmong the minority whose preferences mirrored those of people in Kiim and Nangaritza, \ntheir reasoning was much th e same as people in those areas. They queried the efficacy of \nbasic pharmaceutical -based medical attention as offering \u2018just sedatives.\u2019 They also \nseparated their herbal medicines and pharmaceuticals in the category of treatments for 146 \n \u2018sicknesses of God,\u2019 a s opposed to the \u2018sicknesses of man\u2019 that are cured by shamans. Zoila, \na young mother from Churubia, described a textbook example of a sickness suffered by \nher daughter which she attributed to the envy of a neighbour, and which she said \nworsened following clinical treatment before being properly resolved by a local healer. \nThese same ideas could be seen among many of the so -called \u2018artisan\u2019 miners living in the \nvalley, whose preferences between healing practices tended to be closer to those of Shuar \npeople in the subsistence economy than to those of waged miners. Unfortunately, with a \nsample size of just five, there is little that can be made by way of comparison between the \nformally employed miners and their \u2018artisan\u2019 counterparts.  \nThe next chapter is the f irst in a series of four in which each will address one of the cultural \nvectors described so far and critically interpret its impact upon the health -seeking \npractices and ontology of Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe. The series begins by \ndiscussing the mai ntenance of traditional ontology in health -seeking practices thanks to \nthe geographic isolation of the Upper Nangaritza region; then moves to a consideration of \nthe impact of Evangelism as a competing form of spirituality; then to the Quimi Valley and \nthe fragmentary survival of native practices amidst the developing socialist state; and \nfinally to the way the Pachakutik party and the discourse of indigenous cultural rights \naffects Shuar people\u2019s relationship with ancestral health -seeking knowledge and prac tice. \nI argue that these vectors are just as important to explaining current practices and \nworldviews as the particularities of shared ethnicity, history and cultural inheritance of this \npopulation of indigenous people. The dynamics between these vectors a nd their \ninteractions with this Shuar cultural inheritance account for the complexity of intracultural \ndiversity among the Shuar of the region. When modified with attention given to the 147 \n particularities of local culture, the process of the study offers a wa y to model the evolution \nof indigenous culture and ontology in the context of engagement with western states.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 148 \n Chapter 4: Traditional Ontology in the Sickness and Health of Twenty -First Century Shuar  \n \nThe role of ontological commitments in health -seeking preferences tend to be subtle and \ncomplex, acting in continual engagement with economic obligations, religious injunctions \nand modernist or alter -modern indigenous subjectivities. However, so as to begin with the \nclearest illustration of the  potential of a culturally -specific worldview to shape health -\nseeking practices, the first of the following four thematically oriented chapters focuses on \nthe setting of most marked cultural difference in the present research: that of Shuar \nterritory in th e Upper Nangaritza River Basin (Alto Nangaritza) in and around the Shuar \ncentre of Shaime. This chapter seeks to explain the data in Chapter 3 which showed that \nShuar people in this remote region saw the least benefit in clinical medical services and, by \ncontrast, placed the greatest importance on visionary practices for their health and on \nshamanic practice for the diagnosis and healing of illness. In so doing, it provides one \nexample of an implicit critique of biomedicine based on cultural difference, wit h its roots \nin the ontological and epistemological specificities of the conceptual inheritance of \nAmazonian people. As such, this chapter may be seen as a proof of concept for the value \nof intercultural health (and state interculturality in general) to sti mulate entirely new \nconceptualisations of and approaches to healthcare, or any other public competency of \nimportance to a given political collective.  \nThe chapter commences with the problem of sorcery or \u2018maldad,\u2019 the principal fear for \nwhich Shuar people c onsult shamans for advice, diagnosis and healing. Through the \nexploration of \u2018maldad\u2019 it becomes clear that for Shuar people in remote regions, sickness \nis not necessarily perceived, as it is in biomedicine, as a temporary deviation from the norm 149 \n occupied by individuals who are essentially equivalent, albeit with a distinct set of genetic \nand lifestyle -based \u2018risk factors,\u2019 typically conceived as a personal, individual matter in a \nway that conceals macro -level social problems (Namaste, 2012: 13). Rather, si cknesses \ntermed \u2018maldad\u2019 \u2013otherwise known as \u2018sicknesses of man\u2019 \u2013originate in interpersonal \nconflict and power relations, both at the intracommunal, intercommunal and interspecies \nlevels. The way in which these power relations function and the ideals of hea lth and \nstrength they establish are successively explicated in this chapter based on a series of \nindividual testimonies of illness, healing and subsequent visionary practices aimed at the \ndevelopment of individual power.  \nIllnesses can be revelatory of our  most essential beliefs about the nature of the world and \nour place in it, as they generate crises that painfully illuminate our divergent experiences \nof ourselves as both that which is most intimate and personal, and as inscrutable, \ndisobedient objects. J ean Comaroff bravely but eloquently dubs these \u2018universal \nparadoxes of human existence\u2026[which] centre upon the unity, and at the same time the \nduality, of mind and body, the ambiguity of self as subject and object, and the opposition \nof natural and social being\u2019 (1982: 51). Medicine, then, is an ideal terrain on which to study \ninterculturality, dependent as it is on the profundities of our assumptions about the nature \nof reality.  \n \n \n \n 150 \n Figure 5: Nangaritza man with hunting -dogs , \u00a9 Giordano Ciampini , 2014  \n \n151 \n In the context of Zamora -Chinchipe in the Ecuadorian Amazon, the Upper Nangaritza River \nBasin, which sits in the far south -eastern corner of the country, is the one region with a \nmanifest difference between the cultures of the indigenous Shuar people and mai nstream \nmestizo society. Thanks to the vagaries of geography, geology and the long history of \nPeruvian -Ecuadorian hostilities, the region remained very much isolated until just a few \nyears before fieldwork for this project began, when the bridge crossing t he Nangaritza \nRiver at Las Orqu\u00eddeas was completed. This tiny settlement on the river\u2019s edge, located \nsome two -thirds of the 40km distance between Shaime and the Nangaritza \u2018cant\u00f3n\u2019  capital \nGuayzimi, was previously the end of the road. Shuar people from fu rther up -river were \nobliged to travel to Las Orqu\u00eddeas by motorised canoe along the rocky, shallow waters of \nthe Nangaritza River so as to connect with the rest of Ecuador. Many, of course, did not \nhave the means to do so. Mateo Yankuam, who I met in Kiim but who formerly lived far \nup-river from Shaime, described to me a six -day round -trip he used to make to buy \nmedicines and other supplies; they would make a raft and float downstream, then sell \neverything they had brought with them, make their purchases an d walk back up -river. The \nShuar of Alto Nangaritza, then, of all the interviewees in this study, live and experience \nmost deeply the complex of ideas developed autonomously by their ancestors; in \ncomparison with the rest of the province, they are to a larg e extent economically \nautonomous, and have only experienced minimal subjectification as heathens to be saved \nby Evangelism and as working -class in their positioning with respect to capital, two points \nwhich will be the subject of Chapters 5 and 6 respectiv ely.   \n   \n 152 \n Figure 6: Shaime and the R\u00edo Nangaritza from above, looking south  \n \n\u2018Maldad\u2019, Sickness and Power in Alto Nangaritza  \nOf all the notions through which illness and healing is conceptualised in Alto Nangaritza, \nthe most beguiling and the most liable  to outright dismissal within the dominant rational \ndiscourses that govern biomedicine and public policy is that illness can be caused by the \nmalevolent will of a specialist in such matters, whether acting at a distance or via the use \nof ostensibly mundane  intermediate objects. As introduced in Chapter 3, this phenomenon \nwas typically referenced as \u2018maldad,\u2019 but also as \u2018da\u00f1o,\u2019 \u2018hecho,\u2019 \u2018mal hecho\u2019 and less \ncommonly as \u2018hechicer\u00eda,\u2019 \u2018basura\u2019 and \u2018porquer\u00eda.\u2019 Often it arose in conjunction with \nmentions of th e \u2018envy\u2019 of neighbours and family members as causative of disease, but \nbroadly speaking this envy was not considered active in and of itself. At one point, I was \n153 \n laughed at by my companions in Shaime for suggesting that my own envy and negative \nthoughts mi ght make another person ill; \u2018you\u2019d only make yourself sick,\u2019 I was told, amidst \nthe hilarity. Instead, envy or any other form of ill will was understood as the motivation for \na person to contract a shaman to \u2018harm\u2019 (\u2018hacerle da\u00f1o\u2019) another and make them s ick with \n\u2018maldad\u2019. Similar suffering was also held to potentially strike one\u2019s dependants or animals, \nparticularly cattle, the exemplary object of material envy in these remote parts. In this \nsense, the deployment of envy as an explanation for disease amon g Shuar people is \nostensibly reminiscent of the instinctive egalitarianism of many small -scale societies \nthroughout history (e.g. Taussig, 1980: 20).  \nBy the same token, although this explanation of \u2018maldad\u2019 as shamanically produced illness \nmotivated by en vy holds true as an ideal type, there were hints that it was, more precisely \nspeaking, the most common manifestation of a more complex picture. The position of the \nshaman, which seems at first to be that of a specialist trained in techniques of which other s \nare entirely ignorant, may be described more comprehensively as that of an individual able \nto perpetuate and cure \u2018maldad\u2019 by virtue of their position of exceptional relative power. \nThis can be borne out by inference from discussions of \u2018da\u00f1o\u2019 suffered b y infants, those \nwith the lowest relative power on the social terrain. Some examples were offered by C\u00e9sar \nSantiak, the only professional shaman in Shaime:  \n[O]ne simply sees a chubby baby and gets excited, and causes the baby \u2018da\u00f1o\u2019. Or there can \nalso be a negative energy that a person has, a build -up of negative energy. S/he picks up the \nbaby and like that causes the baby \u2018da\u00f1o\u2019. The baby gets diarrhoea or something. Every \nperson has the capacity to do this, even though they\u2019re not an uwishin , without str ong energy \nsince birth.  154 \n Others maintained that an infant could be \u2018marked\u2019 (\u2018marcado\u2019) and become sick if cradled \nby a pregnant woman, and that mothers therefore had to be awake to the possibility that \na neighbour who they allowed to hold their child may n ot yet be aware that she is \npregnant. Similarly, one woman \u2013a middle -aged mother of seven who lived far up -river in \nNangaritza in a house set well into the forest \u2013said that infants can catch \u2018bronchitis\u2019 when \na powerful animal passes close by the house. She  proffered the example of the jaguar, but \nalso agreed that the same effect could be provoked by a snake, fox or ocelot. The water -\nwillow piri-piri (Justicia pectoralis) was administered by this mother as a prophylactic \nremedy to her babies for this purpose .39 \nThe weak position of an infant in relation to an envious neighbour, a pregnant woman or \na powerful animal mirrors that of a shaman vis -\u00e0-vis an ordinary person. C\u00e9sar Santiak \nrelated the following when asked about his capacity to harm others:  \nFor examp le, if I wanted to do \u2018da\u00f1o\u2019, I wouldn\u2019t just do it right in this moment. Rather, one\u2019s \nenergy has to be prepared. If I were arguing with a person and their energy was low, I would \ndominate them and they would get sick.  \nShaime resident Celestino Wampash ex plained his own experience of \u2018hechicer\u00eda\u2019 in the \nsame vein of relative power or energy:  \n\u2013 Does it [\u2018maldad\u2019] always come from another person, or it is just something that happens \nin life?  \n\u2013 It is always from another person. I have a particular case, what happened to me. On one \noccasion, I was sick, feeling pain in all of this part.  \n\u2013 Your back?  \n                                                        \n39 Intriguingl y, the Peruvian Aguaruna, a related Jivaroan people, consider that one may acquire the \ntsentsak darts with which shamanic power is exercised via the ingestion of piri-piri (Brown, 1985: 60 -61). 155 \n \u2013 My back. Like it was going to break. Afterwards I went to a shaman and he examined me \nand he gave me nat\u00e9m , ayahuasca, and he said to me, \u2018Look, see which person .\u2019 In that way, \nthe person who has done wrong (\u2018mal\u2019) by you becomes clear. It makes us see this. And we \nunderstand that this person is of bad faith. This happened to me. When a person of bad faith \ndoes wrong by a person (\u2018le hace mal a una persona\u2019), it i s very clear. So we go to the \nshaman. He does his treatment, and on the next day all of the pain has gone away, and one \nis left feeling fine (\u2018tranquilo\u2019). For this reason, we believe in sorcery [\u2026] When a person, a \nshaman, is of good faith, he doesn\u2019t har m other people. But when he is of bad faith, we say \nthat the power that he has is oriented towards doing ill (\u2018maldades\u2019). And if he has  a strong \nenergy (\u2018una energ\u00eda fuerte\u2019) and that collides with a person who is weak, it produces \nsickness.  \nHowever, if a ll individuals possess a degree of \u2018energy\u2019 or \u2018power\u2019 that is invisible to the \nnaked eye, where is such power situated, and on what field does it act? Within a paradigm \nof philosophical materialism, it would be easy to slip into a Cartesian categorisation  of \n\u2018maldad\u2019 as a \u2018spiritual\u2019 illness set apart from the physiological terrain claimed by medical \nscience as its field of specialisation. The shaman would then become essentially a \nprofessional specialist in \u2018indigenous mental health\u2019 adept in coming up wi th \u2018culture -\nbound ways of coping,\u2019 according to one proposal for recognising and incorporating \ncultural diversity in healthcare (see Constantine, Myers, Kindaichi & Moore, 2004: 115), \nwhich illustrates the fraught nature of accepting the position of \u2018the c ultural\u2019 as leverage \nfor rights. Such an outcome is not alien to potential mobilisations of the concept of \nintercultural health in Latin America, which has been defined by a leading advocate in \nMexico as \u2018the set of biomedical knowledge and practice applie d in different cultural \ncontexts\u2019 (Campos Navarro, 1999: 76), mainly implying the use of foods, language and 156 \n furniture appropriate to the characteristics of local indigenous populations (Campos \nNavarro, 1999: 77 -8).40 Nonetheless, as materialism is evidentl y not an ontology shared by \nShuar people in Alto Nangaritza, an intercultural state that accepts a definition of culture \nas a \u2018total system of conceptualisation\u2019 \u2013rather than a moniker denoting beliefs of lesser \nontological validity \u2013cannot then marginalise the treatment of \u2018maldad\u2019 as a trivial, \n\u2018spiritual\u2019 issue.  \nThe division between the spiritual and physiological is alien to the ontology implied in many \nShuar testimonies of illness and healing, particularly in Alto Nangaritza. Shuar people do \nuse herbal r emedies without making \u2018spiritual\u2019 interventions or reference to non -ordinary \nlayers of reality, as when curing breaks, sprains, joint pain, prostatitis and kidney -stones. \nHowever, more fundamentally, even shamanically produced ailments and cures are \nreput ed to originate and terminate in the body. For example, in a discussion regarding the \nfirmness of the distinction between good and bad shamans, C\u00e9sar Santiak said of the \nlatter:  \n\u2013 They can hardly cure at all, because the body has learned to perform this \u2018maldad.\u2019  \n\u2013 So it has to be generated from the body?  \n\u2013 Yes, definitely. This is why [indigenous] doctors can get sick in their practice. It\u2019s an \nenergetic thing, no?  \nThe central ity of the shaman\u2019s body to their work is also evident in the notion that they \nare able to \u2018suck\u2019 the \u2018maldad\u2019 out of their patient\u2019s body, draw it into their own and then \neither neutralise or dispose of it. This was a ubiquitous feature of C\u00e9sar\u2019s treatme nts, in \n                                                        \n40 Such initiatives are certainly useful in making existing med ical spaces feel less alien to indigenous people, \nbut fall short of contributing to the development of an inter cultural healthcare that would benefit from a \ndiversity of approaches grounded in epistemic and ontological pluralism.  157 \n which he would visibly vomit the \u2018maldad\u2019 out of his own body. The drawing into their own \nbody by a shaman of an object or essence reputed to be causing a patient\u2019s illness is a \npractice attested to by various Amazonian ethnographers, particularly among indigenous \ngroups with a tradition of ayahuasca use (Descola, 1996: 333; Illius, 1992: 75 -6; Langdon, \n1992: 51; Rubenstein, 2002: 157; Whitten, 1976: 158), but also elsewhere in Amazonia \n(Santos -Granero, 1991: 280).  \n \nA Mother\u2019s \u2018Maldad\u2019  \nThe intimacy  of the energies and energetic interactions whose dissonances and \nimbalances can result in \u2018maldad\u2019 are attested to in the following account from Martina \nTukupi, a resident of Shaime. Martina had trained as a shaman in the aftermath of the \ndeath of her you ng daughter and a prolonged illness she herself suffered, both of which \nshe attributed to \u2018maldad\u2019 directed at her family due to her father\u2019s activities as a shaman. \nFor Martina, the training was a means of protecting herself, and so she stayed on for six \nmonths with a Kichwa shaman from the northern Ecuadorian Amazon who had cured her \nof her lengthy illness and thus convinced her of his capacities. Her story serves as an \nintroduction to a number of elements that are widely corroborated among Shuar people \nin Alto Nangaritza and those elsewhere in the province whose worldview is delineated by \nontology indigenous to the area more than by other influences. In Martina\u2019s words:  \n\u2013 So I spoke with this shaman. I had told him that I was tired of this conflict, and that I was \nalways sick (\u2018vivo enfermo\u2019 [sic]). So he said, \u2018If you want, I will give you this power, so that \nyou may become yachaj  [Kichwa word meaning \u2018one who knows\u2019]. Yachaj means that you are \nvery strong [sic], and when a woman takes hold of this power , the woman is even more 158 \n powerful than a man. So I had to stay there a while. We would drink nat\u00e9m as well as liquor. \nThis shaman knew not just about nat\u00e9m , but about black magic (\u2018magia negra\u2019) and white \nmagic (\u2018magia blanca\u2019). [\u2026]  \n\u2013 Did he always call some sort of spirit to help in curing?  \n\u2013 Yes. For example, when one has an active spirit (\u2018esp\u00edritu vivo\u2019), one makes a call [to a \nspirit], like: \u2018 Heh, heh, heh, heh .\u2019 That was the rhythm for calling, the way to call. So then one \nhad to be ready. The spirit, the power that it has \u2013\u2018Puh! \u2019\u2013a woman is presented to you, or a \nperson. During the drunkenness, this person sings, and the way that it sings, one starts to \nsing in that way as well.  \n\u2013 So you watch, listen, and copy, or is it like it  is you?  \n\u2013 It is inevitable that one then copies, and sings.  \n\u2013 Does everyone see this?  \n\u2013 Only one person. Another person may be drinking nat\u00e9m [as well], but only one person \nsees this.  \n\u2013 Would you see this while drinking nat\u00e9m , or while drinking liquor as well?  \n\u2013 Well, but I wasn\u2019t taught the songs. But what would happen is that my body felt\u2026it was \nlike I was becoming very large. I felt very sick. From there, I could grab hold of the sick \nperson then and cure them very quickly. So this was a step that I  learned. [\u2026]  \nWhen I had recently taken hold of that power from the shaman, I went to leave for home, and \nthe maestro  said to me, \u2018You are leaving very well -protected. You must never hit another \nperson, nor get into arguments, nor be aggressive (\u201cbrava\u201d). Do not get angry.\u2019  \nSo for me, because I am \u2018brava,\u201941 this was directed against my husband. One morning, he \ncomplained to me about what I had been doing, and he said, \u2018If you continue, I\u2019ll declare you \nto the community [as a shaman], and we will separate.\u2019 When he said that to me, it made me \n                                                        \n41 A popular adjective in S huar country, understood to mean aggressive, independent and direct.  159 \n angry. I told him, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to talk like that. If you want to do that, then fine. I am just \nlooking for a way to protect the family.\u2019 That is how I answered him. It made me deeply angry. \nIt arose that \u2018energ\u00eda\u2019 in me. He got up from bed. And as he was going down the steps here, \nhe was struck with dizziness, and he went and lay down over there.  \nHe was lying down, and I asked him, \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019  \n\u2018My head hurts, it really hurts,\u2019 he replied. So I grabbed a remedy f or him and I went and blew \nover him. This stopped the pain a little, and we went to tend to the cattle. Then as we were \nmoving them, his arm fell down by his side, and he couldn\u2019t raise it up again. We came back \nto the house, and he was in a bad way and ve ry faint.  \nI remember the shaman who gave me power said that I should not let myself be seen by any \nother shaman. [My husband] didn\u2019t really believe in these things. But in any case, we went to \nsee the shaman [in Shaime]. So what I did was \u2018apply my secret  (\u2018aplicar mi secreto\u2019), so that \nhe wouldn\u2019t notice me.  \nThe shaman drank nat\u00e9m and he was sitting there, and I was waiting to see if he would \nbecome aware of me. Eventually he said to [my husband], \u2018You have been arguing with an \nindigenous person. Those i ndigenous people are witch -doctors (\u201cbrujos\u201d),\u2019 he said jokingly. \n\u2018You shouldn\u2019t get into arguments.\u2019  \n\u2018No, no, I haven\u2019t been in any arguments,\u2019 my husband replied.  \n\u2018You have, you have argued with someone,\u2019 said the shaman. My husband knew, of course, \nthat  he had been arguing with me. It was eleven at night by this point. I was sitting there, and \nI noticed a cricket sitting on my arm.  \n\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 [my husband] asked. I told him.  \n\u2018Pass it to me,\u2019 said the shaman. \u2018Why is this inside the house, instead of outside?\u2019 he \nwondered.  160 \n This is what I had put onto my husband. It was a defence that I could have put onto anyone, \nand they would have become sick. And so, now that I\u2019d taken it into my hand, I withdrew it.  \nSo the shaman started to suck and suck at [my hus band], but there was nothing there, not \neven a dart (\u2018flecha\u2019). That\u2019s the nature of black magic (\u2018magia\u2019); there was no dart, it was only \nair (\u2018aire\u2019).  \n[My husband] said to me, \u2018Martina, what\u2019s going on? In my dream, I was watching you, and \nyou had a flam e burning from the top of your head. And then you said to me, \u201cI didn\u2019t want it \nto be this way. I never wanted to do you any harm (\u2018da\u00f1o\u2019).\u201d That\u2019s what you promised to me. \nSo, Martina, tell me what is going on?\u2019  \n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I replied. \u2018A dream is a dr eam\u2019 (\u2018Sue\u00f1o es sue\u00f1o\u2019). I hid this from my husband. \nAnd if anyone else had become aggressive with me, or had argued with me or wanted to hit \nme, that person would become sick. That is what the power was.  \n \nThe Shamanic Diagnosis of Sorcery  \nFor many Shuar p eople, especially in Alto Nangaritza, their physical being is intertwined \nwith a normally invisible matrix of energies and influences which must be skilfully \nnavigated if they are to be healthy and thrive. As can already be glimpsed in the \ntestimonies of M artina and Celestino, ayahuasca ( nat\u00e9m ) is for such people a tool allowing \nthem to perceive, understand and empower themselves within this web of influence, \nenergy and relative power. \u2018Maldad\u2019 is evidently visible in the visions provoked by \nhallucinogenic plants, which Shuar people refer to as both \u2018sue\u00f1os\u2019 and \u2018visiones.\u2019 Dreams \nand plant -induced hallucinations seem to hold near -equivalent ontological status in the \ntraditional Shuar worldview. The shaman C\u00e9sar Santiak once interpreted a particular 161 \n dream of  mine as indicative that someone was attempting to afflict me with \u2018maldad\u2019, \nwhich suggests that a dream, like a hallucinogenic vision, is considered to be revelatory of \nexternal referents.   \nShamans, of course, cannot dream and still be awake enough to ex amine their patients. \nAs such, ayahuasca is indispensable in order to \u2018see\u201942 and diagnose patients and to locate \nand remove \u2018maldad.\u2019 C\u00e9sar Santiak spoke of \u2018maldad\u2019 as follows:  \n\u2013 What does it look like?  \n\u2013 It looks like a burning bullet. It will go through  the system eventually, and if it is strong it \nwill burn up the entire organism.  \nYanua resident Ricardo Kayuk, who never practised openly as a shaman but was trained in \nthe same way, described the appearance of \u2018maldad\u2019 almost identically.  \n\u2013 When you look at the patient, how can you tell what sickness they have?  \n\u2013 It\u2019s clear. If it is \u2018mal hecho\u2019, the part where they are affected looks like it is alight.  \n\u2013 It shines?  \n\u2013 Yes. You see it while you are well drugged. So wherever it is that they  are hurting is where \nyou need to suck at them [\u2026] So you suck it in then throw it away. You have to vomit it all \naway, then blow over them with perfume. You are taking out the \u2018mal hecho\u2019, so you have \nto know how to vomit it out, not take it into your bod y, or you\u2019ll die.  \nAccounts from ordinary, non -shaman residents of Alto Nangaritza regarding the diagnosis \nof illness in ayahuasca shamanism corroborated those of Ricardo Kayuk and C\u00e9sar Santiak. \n                                                        \n42 The notion that ayahuasca shamans are able to diagnosis their patients by \u2018seeing\u2019 their illnesses is \nwidespread across Western Amazonia, and is also reported by Kelly (2011: 143, 153) among Yanomami \nshamans using the hallucinogen \u2018yopo\u2019. See Chapter 6, \u2018Perceptions of Shamanism among Miners and \nAnthropologists\u2019.  162 \n For example, Ricardo Naanch described \u2018maldad\u2019 as manifestin g as a sudden illness, for \nwhich one would need to seek out a shaman immediately.  \nThe shaman will be able to say, \u201cYou\u2019ve been \u2018made ill\u2019 (\u2018mal hecho\u2019). I need to examine you \nwhile drinking ayahuasca.\u201d [\u2026] The shaman who is of good faith has to drink ayahu asca and \nlook over you, he has to have tobacco, and blowing tobacco over [you] he can see everything. \nWhile doing that, he can see, \u201cIt was that man who did you harm (\u2018da\u00f1o\u2019).\u201d Then if I have a \nlittle money, and the shaman I am seeing is stronger than the one who did me harm, then the \nshaman I\u2019m seeing can cure me with his faith in God.  \nThese testimonies regarding the use of ayahuasca in shamanism are reminiscent of the \nearly conceptualisation of the potential role of hallucinogens in psychology and \npsychot herapy as akin to that of a \u2018microscope\u2019 (Metzner, 1998: 335),43 in the sense of \nfacilitating the visualisation of otherwise invisible phenomena \u2013in the case of psychology, \nthe inner workings of the human psyche \u2013which are thereby then held to objectively exi st. \nThey also corroborate earlier ethnographic accounts of shamanism in the region, such as \nthe life history of Alejandro Tsakimp, a Shuar shaman based in Morona -Santiago. Tsakimp \ntold anthropologist Steven Rubenstein:  \nWhen I drink nat\u00e9m  to examine an ens orcelled person, I see everything, as if the person is \nnaked. I see the form of the skeleton, and I can see if the person will live or die. [\u2026] I saw him \ncarefully, and I thought, \u2018This is the tsentsak  that wants to kill him. This isn\u2019t an illness; he got \nit through chicha and through concentration\u2019 (2002: 163).   \nThere is a close correlation between these accounts of shamanic diagnosis as based upon \nthe examination of the patient while making use of an ayahuasca -induced state of \n                                                        \n43 Metzner writes, \u2018it has repeatedly been said that psychedelics could play the same role in psychology as \nthe microscope doe s in biology.\u2019  163 \n heightened sensory percepti on. What is notably different, however, is the metamorphosis \nof the concept of tsentsak as the invisible agent of super -physiological illness into \u2018maldad\u2019 \nin the accounts of my shaman interlocutors some two decades after the time when \nRubenstein\u2019s fieldwo rk was carried out. In Alejandro Tsakimp\u2019s account, his diagnosis was \nthat the patient had become sick as a result of drinking ensorcelled chicha. \u2018Concentration\u2019 \nhere refers to sustained focus while under the effects of ayahuasca; several Shuar men \ntold m e that they were able to perceive distant events or the answers to important \nquestions through \u2018concentration\u2019 after drinking the brew. The term tsentsak (called \n\u2018flechas\u2019 by Martina when speaking in Spanish) refers, in a literal sense, to the poisoned \ndarts fired from blowpipes that were the primary tool of hunters before the arrival of \nfirearms, and are mentioned as a central shamanistic tool by Brown (1985: 60), Harner \n(1968: 30), Whitten (1976: 157 -8)44 and Descola. In the latter\u2019s explanation, the shama ns \nknowingly perpetuate the analogy with darts as a sort of layman\u2019s approximation of a \nconcept which ordinary people cannot be expected to perceive or comprehend (Descola, \n1996: 333). One could therefore attribute the shift in metaphors from \u2018 tsentsak \u2019 to \u2018maldad\u2019 \nto contemporary Shuar people\u2019s greater familiarity with Spanish and the Hispanic \nconcepts of \u2018envidia\u2019 and \u2018maldad\u2019 than with poisoned darts and hunting with a blowpipe. \nLikewise, the metaphor likening shamanic attacks to local weaponry means tha t it is not \ncoincidental that the contemporary shaman C\u00e9sar Santiak compared the appearance of \n\u2018maldad\u2019 to a bullet, and that Walter Wampash likened the attack of a powerful shaman to \nbeing shot.  \n                                                        \n44 In a manner analogous to what we have been told by C\u00e9sar and Ricardo, Whitten reports that \nAmazonian Quichua shamans in psychedelic trance see tsintsaca as glowing blue under the skins of their \npatients.  164 \n In a similar vein to the testimonies regarding the visible appearance of \u2018maldad\u2019, numerous \ninterviewees concurred on the fact that the original perpetrator of \u2018maldad\u2019 becomes \napparent under the effects of these plants. Ricardo Kayuk said that \u2018[w]hen someone has \nsuffered a \u201cda\u00f1o\u201d, it is very clear. The person wh o has done it comes in defence, as clear \nas you are sitting here. They come to stop the person from being cured.\u2019 Likewise, Mateo \nKuash from Kiim said, \u2018In the concentration one sees who has carried out the \u201cmaldad\u201d\u2019. \nAnother interviewee, Fernando Tsakimp from Churubia, maintained that the same \npotential exists under the influence of datura. \u2018This makes one see which people are \nopposed to you,\u2019 he said. \u2018Whether they wish you death or \u201cmaldad,\u201d any of the kinds of \n\u201cmaldad\u201d that there are. \u201cGuantu\u201d [datura] gives you all kinds of luck. Via dreams it reveals \neverything to you.\u2019 Clearly Shuar people do not consider ayahuasca and datura to provoke \nmere hallucinations, nor even to facilitate an enhanced psychotherapeutic state that is \nhelpful purely at the level of individual psychology, but rather as a means of perceiving \ndistinctly real external phenomena.  \nThe consumption of hallucinogenic plants is, however, more widespread than its use in \nshamanic diagnosis and the identification of perpetrators of \u2018maldad\u2019. T heir role as a \n\u2018microscope for maldad\u2019 does not explain why these plants were mentioned so regularly \nin discussions on the subject of health and medicine, or why they are so widely consumed. \nWilson Kayuk, the head of a large household in Yanua living outsi de the mining economy, \ndescribed ayahuasca as not just a form of diagnosis but also as a sort of vaccination against \n\u2018maldad\u2019: \u2018As we have this power of nat\u00e9m , we cannot fall into this trap of maldad. We \nprotect ourselves from the bad faith of those around  us.\u2019 Similarly, Shaime\u2019s Walter \nWampash claimed, with regard to ayahuasca, datura and tobacco juice, that \u2018[t]hese three \ndrinks allow one to find/achieve (the) spirit (\u201clograr el esp\u00edritu\u201d) and to be able to survive 165 \n and become stronger spiritually, and al so to know.\u2019 Some first -hand accounts of visionary \nexperiences are revealing in terms of what they say about the nature of \u2018maldad\u2019 and the \nmeaning of \u2018this power of nat\u00e9m \u2019 within Shuar ontology in remote regions of Zamora -\nChinchipe.  \n \nVisionary Experience  in Shuar People\u2019s Lives  \nIf sickness can be caused by a position of relative weakness with respect to those who \nmight wish do harm, the close association between health and power is unsurprising. \nMoreover, the fact that shamans are considered the most dan gerous figures with regard \nto \u2018maldad\u2019 testifies to the notion that power can be drawn from the visionary experiences \nprovoked by plants such as ayahuasca, datura and tobacco and mastered by shamans. This \nnotion was prevalent amongst interviewees from Alto  Nangaritza, as well as some of those \nfrom the Quimi River Valley who lived outside the waged economy.  \nRoberto Taish, for example, a young man from Shaime, praised the physiologically \ntherapeutic characteristics of tobacco, ayahuasca and the herbal infusi on guayusa (Shuar: \nwa\u00eds ; Latin: Ilex guayusa), a relative of yerba mate. These plants, he said, could cure the flu, \nstomach aches and stomach bloating, respectively; however, \u2018these things also help you \nwith your power and your luck [\u2026] it means that we do n\u2019t feel lazy or listless.\u2019 Ayahuasca \nis a \u2018medicine\u2019 that \u2018helps to acquire power (\u201ccoger poder\u201d),\u2019 but datura \u2018is specifically for \nacquiring power. This is not something that is drunk for healing. Well, when a little is drunk \nas a medicine [in the case o f broken bones], then yes. But its proper use is for acquiring \npower: you acquire power to have money, to have a good woman, to have a lot of chooks, \nor perhaps to have a lot of women.\u2019 Roberto\u2019s testimony includes two ideas that are 166 \n intimately related for  Shuar people. The value given to the purgative attributes of guayusa \nand ayahuasca accords with the widely apparent ideals \u2013particularly important for men \u2013of \nausterity and resistance to physical suffering. In visionary practices, this often seemed to \nhave dovetailed with the value placed on suffering for spiritual betterment within the \nCatholic tradition. In Walter Wampash\u2019s interview, for instance, he described the measures \nthat needed to be taken when drinking datura:  \nIf one is going to use maikiua , one has to fast for 15 -20 days: with the stomach empty, going \nto the waterfalls, to the rocks and high mountains.  \n\u2013 Can you drink chicha?  \n\u2013 You can drink chicha, but only very little, and less and less. More, you drink tsaank  \n(tobacco), [because] the body has to feel cushioned, so as not to feel hunger. It is from such \nsacrifice that God sees that sacrifice and knows that the person is trying to achieve/find \n(\u2018lograr\u2019) something, so that in dreams (\u2018sue\u00f1os\u2019), he will tell you something, he will let you \nfind the  dreams to which he has destined you.  \nWhen speaking of acquiring power, then, Shuar people imply both the experience of a \nvision as well as the purging of the body, resulting in its subsequent vitality and stoicism. \nThis is an element that is consistent wi th other accounts of the importance of plant -\ninduced visionary experience, even if it is often not the primary focus. Consider the much \nbriefer account of Bol\u00edvar Chumpi, from Shaime , who said that one should drink ayahuasca \nand datura \u2018in order to see vis ions, to be able to see what luck we are going to have, or if \nwe are going to have luck or not, and in order to have more power and strength.\u2019 Similarly, \nFernando Tsakimp, from Churubia, said that datura \u2018gives luck\u2019 and \u2018gives a man potency \nto live a long  time.\u2019  167 \n When phrased in such a way, it is made to seem that greater power is the automatic result \nof drinking such plant concoctions, which generates a very abstract impression of the \npractice. This is exacerbated by the reticence of some to speak about th e details of their \nvisionary experiences. An earlier anthropologist, Steven Rubenstein, who lived in Morona -\nSantiago for several years in the 1990s, reported that the only Shuar people who would \nreveal the details of their visions to him were those who had  already seen them come true \n(2012: 51), and some of the Shuar I met shared this custom. Fernando Tsakimp of Churubia, \nfor one, told me:  \nA daughter of mine drank \u2018guantu\u2019 as well, when she had a sore throat. Later she was telling \nher mother that it reveal ed many things to her and explained to her where she had arrived at \nso far. It is very, very good. Of course, she can\u2019t reveal right now what dream it gave her. It \ngave her a good dream and she has to reach that point that it showed her.  \nMore commonly, in terviewees would simply confirm that they had drunk ayahuasca or \ndatura and express that they had faith that their visions would be fulfilled, while \nsidestepping any effort on my part to prompt further elaboration on the experience. This \nwas particularly o bvious in the interview recorded with the otherwise conversational \nRafael Nantip of Shaime.  \nFortunately, there were some who, for whatever reason, were willing to describe details \nof their visionary experiences. In these accounts, the sense of personal emp owerment was \nnot an abstract and automatic result of consuming hallucinogenic plants, but instead \nseemed to stem from a newfound perspective on themselves, their identity, their \ncapacities and their place in time. Byron Santiak, a Shaime man in his early t wenties, 168 \n offered an expressive account of the visions he experienced in adolescence, something he \nexplored after having been cured of \u2018maldad\u2019 by a shaman:  \n\u2013 Let me tell you something, when you have suffered \u2018da\u00f1o,\u2019 the symptoms are very clear.  \n\u2013 Have you  felt this yourself?  \n\u2013 Yes. When I was young, I had problems with my vision. It was like a spider -web in front of \nmy eyes. I was fine for my first twelve years, then this hit me. This web started to cover my \nvision more and more, and it stung like I had s alt in my eyes.  \n\u2013 In one eye or both?  \n\u2013 In both eyes. It got to the point where I couldn\u2019t see. I\u2019d get headaches. At night -time it \nfelt like a storm. My father took me to curanderos and they couldn\u2019t cure me. Then I went to \nmy uncle, who also drank nat\u00e9m . He was able to cure me. He cleaned out everything \n(\u2018limpiar\u2019). He was able to save me. From here on my head, and here on my chest, he pulled \nout a little bug. That was what was harming me. From there, I never felt the problem again.  \nI drank a lot of \u2018gua ntu\u2019 ( maikiua ) when I was very young, and nat\u00e9m . After I was cured, at \ntwelve years -old, I started to drink [ maikiua  and nat\u00e9m ] a lot. When I drank \u2018guantu,\u2019 I knew \nthat I was going to be conscripted [into the army]. I saw that. I also saw myself going to \nschool and learning how to use computers, how to ride a motorcycle.  \n\u2013 And this motivated you?  \n\u2013 Exactly. All of these dreams (\u2018sue\u00f1os\u2019) are fulfilled. When you enter a program of study, for \nexample, now that you\u2019ve had the vision, once you begin, it\u2019s eas y. You pick up everything \nquickly. Drinking nat\u00e9m  I also saw my wife. I was much younger, but I knew that I was going \nto marry her one day.  \nThese things are not obligatory for people. Maikiua , this makes you drunk for three days, but \nit is really good. Fr om very young, one can see what is going to unfold in your life. It\u2019s very \ngood to drink from a young age. People can\u2019t put you off track easily. You have your own 169 \n talent.  \n\u2013 Like a self -knowledge?  \n\u2013 Self-knowledge. Just like that, it\u2019s very good to drink f rom a young age.  \nByron is clearly quite responsive to my own suggested framings of his experience in terms \nof \u2018motivation\u2019 and \u2018self -knowledge.\u2019 Nonetheless, his is an invaluable account in that it \nleads from the original motivation for drinking to the vi sions themselves and then his first -\nhand experience of their materialisation. Drawing from this account, the widely reported \ncharacteristic of ayahuasca and in particular datura of providing a vision of one\u2019s future \ncomes across as an abbreviated explanati on. Instead, Byron spoke about how the \nforeshadowing of these personal feats in his visions allowed him to easily accomplish them \nwhen the time came. In this sense, the visions allowed him to see \u2013before his time, as it \nwere \u2013his own place in the adult world  modulated according to his own pre -existing desires \nand capacities, which were in turn modulated and concretised in the visionary \nexperience.45 There is no evidence to suggest that Byron perceived his vision as a pre -\nordained fact; he specifically says, \u2018P eople can\u2019t put you off track easily,\u2019 a recognition of \nthe possibility of failure. By the same token, although the vision is never a guarantee, there \nis a clear sense that one\u2019s personal strength is drawn from pursuing the fulfilment of one\u2019s \nvision. Livi ng in alignment with vision is a source of power, while diversion from that vision \nis conversely a hazard and the origin of weakness and vulnerability.46  \n                                                        \n45 The role of hallucinogenic visions in adolescent development of identity here mirrors the Shipibo -Conibo \nconcept of caya , what Bruno Illius terms \u2018dream ego\u2019 (1992: 66), which a person must be able to hold if they \nare to survive and which is dependent on their general level of strength and vitality. The dream ego is \nconsidered the counterpart of the spirits one engages with during hallucinogenic visions (Illius, 1992: 75).   \n46 Again, visionary practices in Alto Nangaritza are closely related to those docum ented among other \nJivaroan peoples several decades ago. Michael Brown described the Aguaruna conceptualisation of vision -\nseeking as follows: \u2018The person who does succeed in seeing the vision is doing more than seeing a \npreordained future. The future exists  as a set of possibilities that are given shape by the effort to bring \nthem into consciousness within the visionary experience\u2019 (1986: 60).  170 \n This broadening of personal perspective and attainment of a sense of purpose appears to \nbe the source of the greater vitality and dynamism that is subsequently attributed by \nothers as the direct outcome of the visionary experience. The desirability of these \u2018positive \nside -effects,\u2019 as it were, explains why the majority of interviewees related that their fi rst \nexperiences were arranged by their parents during their adolescence. Martina Tukupi \nrendered articulately this widely shared parental motivation. After giving young people \ndatura or ayahuasca, she said,  \nYou notice the difference in children that were lazy. They\u2019re no longer lazy. They become \ndifferent. They become active, no longer slow. They work and they\u2019re no longer \nargumentative or capricious.  \nSimilarly, Estalin Taasham commented the following, with regard to preparing datura for \nhis children:  \n\u2013 It is for their studies, for their life, for the time to come, particularly their studies.  \n\u2013 So you want the child to become more dedicated?  \n\u2013 Yes. They are more dedicated in their study and their work. When once they were lazy, \nthey leave all that behind.  They become dedicated to a different path.  \nIn contrast to the notion of an initiation rite that reveals to the initiate sacred information \nabout the true nature of the world, Shuar adolescents\u2019 visionary experiences tend to be \noriented toward attaining a more individualistic insight into their own capacity to act \nwithin that world. It does not make sense to speak of the indigenous understanding of \nhealth and medicine in Alto Nangaritza abstracted from the notion of vision as a guiding \nlife ideal, as well as a quasi -object, in possession of which one  becomes strong, healthy and \nempowered and without which one is left weakened, marginalised and vulnerable. The 171 \n statement that hallucinogenic visions are essential to health is one way of framing the \nnotion that they play an essential role in a person\u2019s li fe development and Shuar people\u2019s \nidea of the right way to live.  \n \nPower Vibrating on other Frequencies  \nIn a society composed of such well -adapted people with a clear sense of their direction in \nlife, one might wonder where illness and social conflicts ori ginate. The key here is to \nunderstand that although visions are experienced in an intensely personal manner, they \nare not confined to the individual\u2019s psychology. In fact, vision for Shuar people is both an \ninternal and an external phenomenon: in the latte r sense, a vision implicates a variety of \nother entities each typically possessing its own vision, such that their interactions, \nresonances and discordances have dramatic effects that manifest constantly in the visible, \neveryday world. An experience of ill ness recounted by Freddy Santiak, half -brother to \nC\u00e9sar and some twenty years his junior, provides an amplification of the scope of this field \nof relative power on which \u2018maldad\u2019 becomes intelligible and to which dreams and \npsychedelic visions provide brie f but invaluable insights.  \n\u2013 I used to go fishing, all the time, going out to fish [on the river] at night. I was fishing so \nmuch, day after day after day. And there, the animal from the water harmed me (\u2018me hizo \nda\u00f1o\u2019). I have still this mark on my body.  \n\u2013 What was it?  \n\u2013 It was the seahorse, as they say [in Spanish].  \n\u2013 I don\u2019t know what you mean.  \n\u2013 It was Tsunki  [\u2018The mermaid,\u2019 Freddy\u2019s wife affirms in the background]. I didn\u2019t realise 172 \n what was happening at the time. I simply heard a whistling sound, not hing more, on the \nother side of the wall [by the river]. It harmed me and I started to vomit.  \n\u2013 When you arrived back at your house?  \n\u2013 No, right there at the dock. So I started to vomit. It was like that. We called my brother, \nC\u00e9sar Santiak. I fainted and  I woke up in the house. This was when I started to learn about \nShuar medicines.  \nTsunki, a term that can refer flexibly to a class of spirits as well as a singular being of the \ntype, are water spirits who inhabit the underwater realm in a way that mirrors the sociality \nof human beings. As one of Philippe Descola\u2019s Achuar confidants put it sometime in the \nlate 1970s in an isolated region of Morona -Santiago:  \n\u2018Anaconda is one of Tsunki\u2019s domesticated animals and obeys him in everything, just like a \ndog. A few  years ago, Yuu [\u2026] visited Tsunki in his house, and there were lots of anacondas \nthere; he was very scared. This Yuu met Tsunki because he is a powerful shaman, an uwishin : \nhe sees things that we cannot [\u2026] Yuu says that in the water, the Tsunki have hous es just like \nours and that they are just like human beings in every way. The old Tsunki man was seated on \na coiled anaconda and he had Yuu sit on a big tortoise that poked out its head to take a look \nat him with his round eyes\u2019 (1996: 143).  \nSo if Tsunki a re in essence human beings, \u2018embody[ing] all the precepts of ideal sociability\u2019 \n(Descola, 1996: 146), but a kind who live in an aquatically -themed alternate universe which \nmostly parallels but also overlaps in some way with the visible world of humans, how  and \nwhy did Freddy find himself the subject of their animosity? Freddy continued:  \nWhat happened is, I was going out to fish every day. And as our ancestors said, our \ngrandparents who lived here with us, they said, \u2018To Tsunki the coronchos [a common river 173 \n fish] are chickens. Coronchos are chickens for Tsunki\u2019 (\u2018Para Tsunki son gallinas los \ncoronchos\u2019).  \nSo Freddy was met with the same hostility that Shuar people reserve for the pesky foxes \nand ocelots that attempt to steal their own chickens. As the archetyp al shamans of Shuar \nmythology, the Tsunki may have become angry and struck down Freddy with an intangible \nattack of \u2018maldad.\u2019 Or perhaps \u2018maldad\u2019 is the only way to make sense of the human side \nof an experience which for Tsunki was the equivalent of firing  a gun (which perhaps shoots \npoisonous sea -snakes) to scare off a chicken -thieving intruder. However its details are \nvisualised, Freddy was clearly overwhelmed by a power which he could not accurately \nperceive, and which had a near fatal impact on him.  \nFigure 7: The Nangaritza River near Shaime  \n \n174 \n To make sense of this experience and the broader phenomenon of illnesses attributed to \n\u2018maldad,\u2019 one has to understand traditional Shuar ontology as relying on the mutual \nimplication of the ordinarily apparent phys ical world with other invisible and perhaps more \nfundamental layers of reality. Following Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, one could say that a \nclash of perspectives caused the illness of Freddy Santiak. In the formulation of Viveiros de \nCastro (1998) as well a s Descola (e.g. 2013b: 132), the animist ontology of Amazonian \npeoples is said to invert western multiculturalism \u2013in which the universal state of nature is \nopposed to the multiplicity of cultures \u2013such that the universal state shared between all \nbeings beco mes human consciousness, in spite of the obvious diversity of physical forms \nof such beings as animals, plants and spirits. For the West, the fundamental element or \nsubstratum of reality is nature, for which culture is not an equal pair but instead one \npossible manifestation of nature. In indigenous Amazonian ontology, by contrast, \u2018humans \nand animals [are] immersed in the same socio -cosmic medium\u2019 (Viveiros de Castro, 1998: \n473) within which their divergent physical forms are \u2018a mere envelope (a \u201cclothing\u201d ) which \nconceals an internal human form, usually only visible to the eyes of the particular species \nor to certain trans -specific beings such as shamans\u2019 (1998: 472). In this case, then, a being \nwhich Freddy would only be able to perceive as \u2018a seahorse\u2019 at tacked him through a \u2018socio -\ncosmic medium\u2019 of which in his ordinary, waking physical presence he was not aware, thus \nprovoking an illness that was severe yet without specifically correlated physical symptoms. \nFreddy reported vomiting, then fainting, then s ubsequently developing a fever and a \npainful swelling that moved about his body over several days before forming into a weal \nnear his armpit. In an example of the pragmatic modus operandi of Shuar patients and the \nmestizo medical doctors who attend to them  in Alto Nangaritza, Freddy ultimately \nconsulted a doctor at the clinic in Shaime, explained the entire series of events and was 175 \n prescribed a balm which facilitated the healing of the skin condition  and his return to full \nhealth.  \n \nSorcery as Diversion  \nIf power, health and strength are generated by living in alignment with one\u2019s vision, \nFreddy\u2019s experience makes it clear that becoming embroiled in an alien vision can be a \nperilous turn of events. This principle helps to explain some of the more elusive examp les \nof \u2018maldad\u2019 reported by interviewees when asked about their experiences of illness. It also \nhelps explain why \u2018maldad\u2019 could be directed against a family as a whole, given that one\u2019s \nvision necessarily includes those in the immediate personal sphere. W ithin this framework, \nan illness recounted by Sonia from Shaime falls into place. In her words, when asked \nwhether she had ever had reason to consult a shaman:  \n\u2013 Well, we get married, and they say that crazy women look for other men, they say. I have \nimag ined this as well. Yes, this has happened to me. As I am now, I\u2019m with my husband [\u2026] \nas I said, there are people with bad hearts (\u2018de mal coraz\u00f3n\u2019), and this person had been seeing \nthat I was living well/right (\u2018vivir bien\u2019), and this person didn\u2019t like t hat I was living well, \nworking\u2026I don\u2019t know exactly. With this paper in the books of \u2018magia\u2019, as they say, a lot of \nyoung people learn them. I don\u2019t understand what it actually says in them. So this young man \nlearned how to work with this, and it went agai nst me and harmed me (\u2018va contra conmigo y \nhacerme da\u00f1o\u2019 [sic]). So I had problems and my husband told me, \u2018You are sick.\u2019  \n\u2018I\u2019m not sick,\u2019 I said. \u2018I don\u2019t have any pain in my body to be sick,\u2019 I was saying.  \nBut he said, \u2018You\u2019re sick habitually (\u201chabitual mente\u201d). You need to see an uwishin .\u2019 \nAnd I kept saying, \u2018I am not sick. I don\u2019t have any pains at all,\u2019 I told him, and yet internally, yes \nI was sick.  176 \n So then, in order to find out, this \u2018colono\u201947 from Peru knew how to make a product they call \nSan Pedro . Others, brothers who were always drunk, have said, \u2018He set me right\u2019 (\u2018\u00c9l me hizo \nbien\u2019). So he did a treatment for me. And I said the truth, and to this maestro  I said, \u2018Help me, \nbecause I am like this, in my home.\u2019 And he understood me well, and so he gave me this \nproduct to drink. I drank it, and then in the drunkenness of this, many things appeared to me. \nThere it explained to me why I was like this and who harmed me (\u2018me hizo da\u00f1o\u2019), which young \nman it is, and why he did it. It told me everything, an d I thought, \u2018Ah, now I get it.\u2019 This product, \nSan Pedro, yes, it set me right. If I hadn\u2019t drunk that, I wouldn\u2019t have had any thought of \nstaying here and living with my husband. I would have left all my babies and gone far away, I \ndon\u2019t know where, but t his remedy stopped me.  \n\u2013 Was this the sickness, I mean \u2026  \n\u2013 This bother (\u2018molestia\u2019), that I couldn\u2019t live well/right, I wasn\u2019t loving my husband, it felt \nugly to sleep with him, I was looking at other people, like that. But I drank this remedy and I \nloved  my husband again. Now when I find myself fighting with him, it\u2019s resolved quickly and \nI\u2019ll be back playing as though nothing happened. And now I don\u2019t have any ideas about \ngoing far away, of leaving my babies, nothing. This happened to me.  \nIn this case th e illness, the \u2018da\u00f1o,\u2019 is alleged to have originated with a young man who \nseems to have been a spurned lover of Sonia. The \u2018da\u00f1o\u2019 was intended to break up the \nhappy equilibrium of her life and lead her to seek satisfaction elsewhere, such that Sonia\u2019s \nhusb and and ultimately Sonia herself concluded that she was \u2018sick.\u2019 Interestingly, the logic \nof the experience matches what we have seen thus far, even though the plant used \u2013San \nPedro (Latin: Echinopsis pachanoi), a cactus native to the Andes that contains mes caline \u2013\nis not indigenous to Shuar practice. Although the story can be likened to a therapeutic \n                                                        \n47 Literally \u2018colonist\u2019, the word is used interchangeably with \u2018mestizo\u2019 by Shuar people.  177 \n psychedelic experience, Shuar ontology situates the causative element outside of Sonia\u2019s \nindividual psychology and locates it instead with an enemy alleged to ha ve used magical \nmeans to derail her reality.  \nOther interviewees reported very similar experiences, albeit under different names. Estalin \nTaasham, who lived a day\u2019s walk into the forest from Shaime, explained that the shamans \nmay load an object with \u2018mal\u2019 s uch that it does not necessarily need to lodge in the body \nof its victim to cause harm. As with Sonia\u2019s experience, Estalin confirms that \u2018maldad\u2019 may \naim at disrupting the intimate social sphere.  \n  \u2013 Yes, [the object] carries the strength of the shaman wh o is doing evil (\u2018mal\u2019). Then one \nstarts to become sick.  \n\u2013 So would you have to touch it?  \n\u2013 No. They would leave it in your house, or somewhere outside, and it does harm in the \nwhole area. It could be buried just a little under the surface of the earth. It does harm to the \nfamily and makes couples separate.  \n\u2013 Has this ever happened to you?  \n\u2013 Five times it has happened to me, when I was living in Libertad. It was a man with a bad \nspirit (\u2018mal genio\u2019) who did it. I think he did it to make my family fight,  or to harm my family. \nEach time it was removed thanks to my brother -in-law. Once, he even used a human bone, \nplaced in a bottle; other times teeth.  \n\u2013 So you found these objects?  \n\u2013 Yes, teeth and bones. Or sometimes they use the wool of an animal. Once we  took away \nthese objects, the sicknesses went away.  \n\u2013 And it was causing fights?  \n\u2013 It causes fights, it makes you feel terrible, like you cannot stay there. You want to go far 178 \n away and leave your family. That\u2019s how you feel. You feel unhappy. After that,  we all \ndecided to move here to get away from it.  \nA similar story was told by Mishell Kantuash, who was the niece of a renowned shaman \nand lived in Yanua, another interviewee from the Quimi River Valley who lived outside the \nmining economy and attributed great importance to visionary experiences. In her version, \nher teenage son\u2019s waywardness and disobedience was regarded as the result of magical \ninterventions against her family that were the product of jealousy at their success.  \nMy son doesn\u2019t live with me anymore, but I am taking him to see [my uncle] as well. He told \nme that they\u2019ve done the \u2018porquer\u00eda\u2019 to him, so I need to take him. He\u2019s going to get a \ntreatment from him.  \n\u2013 It would be interesting also to see how he treats you r son? Is he sick? [\u2026] Or is it more \nthan he is in with the wrong crowd (\u2018andando en malas cosas\u2019)?  \n\u2013 He never comes home. He is always going around with his friends. He didn\u2019t used to be like \nthat. My uncle told me, \u2018They given him \u201clas porquer\u00edas de vid a\u201d,\u2019 so that he becomes \nseparated from me.  He has practically been made (\u2018hecho\u2019) like that, because my son was \nnever like that. He always spent time at home. Now he doesn\u2019t listen and he fights with me, \nand he\u2019s always going out. It hurts me a lot becaus e he was never like that. So I am going to \ntake him there tomorrow.  \n\u2013 Do you think he will go?  \n\u2013 But he has to. Who else could treat him? And if not, it\u2019s not going to stop. I\u2019m his mother, \nand I can have him treated. Anyway, while I\u2019m selling plantains you can go on ahead.  \n\u2013 Is your son going to drink nat\u00e9m  with your uncle?  \n\u2013 Yes. I\u2019m going to make that happen, so that this \u2018porquer\u00eda\u2019 that they have given him is all \nejected.  179 \n So again, drinking ayahuasca is perceived as necessary to cure a \u2018mal\u2019 that h as not made \nthe target physically sick, but has instead created conflict in the immediate personal \nsphere. There is a contrast here between what many western users of ayahuasca would \nidentify as a psycho -social issue to be resolved on an individual level v ia \u2018deeper self -\nknowledge\u2019 and \u2018the elimination of so -called \u201cinner demons\u201d\u2019 (Kavensk\u00e1 & Simonov\u00e1, \n2015: 354; see also Fotiou, 2010: 195) and Mishell\u2019s view that the disruption of her vision for \nher family is the result of a negative external influence. Th is contrasting pattern of \ninterpretations between westerners and indigenous Amazonians has been noted by \nEvgenia Fotiou (2010: 201) in her research on differing explanations for negative ayahuasca \nexperiences between the two groups. In the examples offered  here, \u2018maldad\u2019 as an \nexternalisation of psycho -social issues appears to expedite the resolution of these issues \nin the visionary experience, while at the same time encouraging hostility between groups \nof Shuar people. In this case, it is debatable whether  the \u2018maldad\u2019 was directed against \nMishell\u2019s son specifically. Her rationale was certainly that of group hostility as the \nunderlying motive. The following exchange originated with my mention of my upcoming \nvisit to the neighbouring town of Churubia:  \n\u2013 The thing is, people around here are not so good. I tell you this out of my humanity. I share \nblood as much with them as with you [i.e. not at all]. And the people there are not as good \nas we are. There are bad people, I tell you. There are bad people, m ore bad people, and \nsome good people. [\u2026] My son has his enemies here. It\u2019s a little Shuar, who I\u2019m talking \nabout. Look, the people in Churubia are dirty. But it\u2019s your decision.  \n\u2013 I feel like now that I\u2019m in this area [\u2026] So what you\u2019re saying is that a person gave your \nson\u2026something. Why? Why does it have to be that?  \n\u2013 That\u2019s the law of things. Envy is like that. I\u2019m going to tell you: I am the niece of [a 180 \n prominent shaman]. And so my cousins and my brothers are not just anyone. They drive \ncars. They ha ve studied (\u2018Son preparados\u2019). My uncle has money. He travelled to Spain and \nworked there for 3 \u20134 months. Then he comes back and lives here for 2 \u20133 months, then goes \nback. That\u2019s why they want to harm ( \u2018da\u00f1ar\u2019) my son. I know that he will be exactly the \nsame. But my son fell into a trap.  \nIn Shuar territory in the twenty -first century, the kind of regular, overt hostilities \nencountered by Philippe Descola and Anne -Christine Taylor among Achuar people in the \n1970s have ceased. However the suppression of feudi ng with the arrival of the Ecuadorian \nstate has quite likely encouraged shamanic attacks as the new primary vector for inter -\ngroup aggression, as well as encouraging the attribution of all kinds of misfortune to the \nshamanism and envy of others.  \n \nHealth/Si ckness, Power/Marginalisation  \nIn such a terrain, the importance of health and medicine is not limited to the resolution of \nspecific physiological symptoms. If illness is caused by weakness when faced with the ever -\npresent threat of \u2018maldad\u2019 and the envy of  others, then it is the role of medicine to \ncontinue strengthening human beings whenever they perceive the need for it.48 I have \nreferred to this ontology of health and illness as \u2018traditional\u2019 because it shares many \ncommonalities with the worldview documen ted by anthropologists researching decades \nago, in a society independent of if not unaffected by the outside world. Michael Harner \ndocumented the Shuar practice of vision -seeking and explained its cultural significance in \n                                                        \n48 Similarly, amongst the Shipibo and Conibo peoples, who also make use of ayahuasca, health in the \ngeneral sense of vitality is connoted by the same word as is used to signify willpower and the capacity for \nlogical thought (Illius, 1992: 64).  181 \n terms of men\u2019s desire to accumulat e \u2018Ar\u00fatam souls,\u2019 which can be acquired by \nencountering them as visions produced by ingesting datura and other psychoactive plants. \nAccording to Harner, Shuar people \u2018believe that the possessor of a single ar\u00fatam soul \ncannot be killed by any form of physic al violence, poison, or by sorcery\u2019 (1972: 135); \u2018the \nar\u00fatam soul is supposed to increase a person\u2019s power in the most general sense,\u2019 including \nincreasing \u2018one\u2019s intelligence as well as simple physical strength\u2019 and \u2018resistance to \ncontagious diseases\u2019 (19 72: 139). A person able to obtain a second ar\u00fatam soul \u2018cannot die \nof any cause whatever, including contagious disease\u2019 (1972: 136, emphasis in original). \nAnne -Christine Taylor described ar\u00fatam vision -seeking practice among Achuar people as \naimed at attain ing a \u2018state of super well -being\u2019 (1996: 208). There is evident continuity, \nthen, with the role of vision -seeking for protection against disease among contemporary \nShuar people, particularly in remote areas outside the wage economy. However, given the \nrelu ctance of prior generations of Shuar people to reveal the details of their visions to \nethnographers, we will likely never know whether their visions were operative in \ngenerating personal power in the same way as visions are for Shuar people today.  \nWhat is  clear is that twenty -first century Shuar people self -consciously reinterpret their \nown vision -seeking behaviour in light of this history, recasting the quest for power and \nprotection as violent dominance over others into an understanding of power in a for m \nmore relevant to their current situation. Emblematic of this perception was Walter \nWampash, a resident of Shaime and an outspoken member in its collective organisation.  \nNow, currently, we are able to attain a spirit so as to achieve maximal power, in th e \nmayoralties, the provincial government, city councils (\u2018podr\u00edamos lograr un esp\u00edritu para \nlograr el poder m\u00e1ximo, como en las alcald\u00edas\u2026\u2019). We have been able to attain this dream \n(\u2018sue\u00f1o\u2019). In contrast, 50 or 60 years ago these things were used to attain  (\u2018lograr\u2019) spirit and 182 \n maximum power so that others could not defeat them in war. The ancestry of the Shuar \nnationality was warlike and vengeful in this sense. As such, they used to use it like this; and \npresently, we use it to achieve our greatest dreams (\u2018lograr nuestros sue\u00f1os m\u00e1ximos\u2019). \nPolitical power is what we speak of now. Without spiritual power (\u2018potencia spiritual\u2019) to \nachieve a politics, we would be nothing these days.  \nThe central point here is clear and explicit: just as vision -seeking empowere d and inspired \nthe Shuar of yesteryear to face mortal struggles, today\u2019s Shuar people must seek out \nvisions to enable them to succeed in claiming political power in order to survive. In \nNangaritza \u2018cant\u00f3n,\u2019 Shuar have won positions in the  tiny municipal co uncils, while other \nformer community leaders have gone on to claim salaried positions in the Pachakutik \norganisation. Further north in Morona -Santiago, where Shuar are more numerous, the \nprovincial government has been headed by Shuar man Marcelino Chumpi.49 Secondarily, \nhowever, and more subtly, Walter\u2019s comments also reveal more about the nature of these \nhallucinogenic visions in traditional Shuar ontology. The dream or vision is not simply \nsomething that is experienced and then informs Shuar people\u2019s lives . It is also, in a sense, \nsomething that is possessed by the person who has experienced it, as an addition to the \nperson who they previously were. Far from being a flight of fancy, a dream serves as a \nguiding vision which leads its bearer towards itself as  a non -guaranteed form of destiny.  \nOther Shuar concurred that the empowering qualities of hallucinogenic visions are as \nrelevant today as ever. Fernando Tsakimp\u2019s testimony corroborated that of Walter \nWampash in expressing the centrality of visions to emp owering Shuar people in \n                                                        \n49 The future of Chumpi\u2019s tenure as Pr efect is unclear. He was convicted of embezzlement in December \n2016 but is currently pursuing an appeal.  183 \n contemporary non -violent, political struggles. With regard to ingesting datura, Fernando \nreported:  \n[I]t gives luck, any kind of luck: to have a longer life, to have more strength, to be able to have \ndisputes with friends or enemies . It\u2019s not for fighting; it\u2019s for arguing and debating, like \nstudents and lawyers do. [\u2026] This is the bravery of the Shuar. When one comes to argue with \nyou, they will feel cowardly and go away. This is the strength that we have, from \u2018guantu\u2019.  \nThese comme nts are implicitly addressed toward refuting the idea that datura is only \nconsumed by those who are preparing to fight and kill. As such, Fernando is reclaiming \ntheir legitimacy for the world faced by Shuar people in the twenty -first century. In his \ninterv iew, conducted in Yanua, Wilson Kayuk put forward the same idea.  \nDoing that, it gives you power. You can become a politician and advance. You could become \na president or a philosopher or a doctor and advance in that way. In that way, we develop our \ninherit ance as Shuar.  \nAgain, this is a vision -seeking practice that is separated from shamanic practice; shamans \nare not omnipresently playing the archetypal role of \u2018mediator between the supernatural \npowers and man\u2019 (Hultkrantz, 1985). Wilson confirmed this indi vidualistic characteristic of \nShuar spiritual practice:  \n\u2013 I have one more question if I may. I have noticed that in this town there are no \nprofessional shamans. You use nat\u00e9m and you use maikiua , but there are no shamans.  \n\u2013 The power is there. You drink nat\u00e9m and that\u2019s where the power is. You see your future \nlife and the generation that is going to come to be. One develops one\u2019s luck, to become a \nprofessional, to learn how to fly international tourist planes and be a pilot, this power, this \ngives you a luc k. For example, you drink nat\u00e9m and in the midst of this power you can see \nthat you will become a great professional.  184 \n \u2013 Is it the same with nat\u00e9m as with maikiua ?  \n\u2013 The same. One learns. You are certain that you are going to become a professional. You \nare not going to become just any man.  \nWilson\u2019s comments are irresistibly comparable to the impressions noted by Shane Greene \nof masculine life ideals in Aguaruna territory. \u2018[A]ccording to a certain understanding of \nthings,\u2019 he notes with respect to psychede lic plant -derived visions, \u2018without such a vision \na man is just a man, doomed to a fate of lifelong mediocrity and obscurity that many men \nsecretly fear\u2019 (2009: 80). To be healthy, then, is not simply to be free of illness; but rather, \nto be powerful and i mmersed in a continual process of realising one\u2019s potential.  \nWe have seen, then, that for Shuar people in remote regions, the notion of traditional \nmedicine is more expansive than a therapeutical model based on the treatment of \nsymptoms in order to return  an individual to a state of normal health. To speak of \n\u2018medicine\u2019 and \u2018medicinal plants\u2019 in the context of Alto Nangaritza is to invoke a range of \nideas, some of which correspond more closely to what we might think of as \npsychotherapy, socialisation, empo werment and self -development, as well as seemingly \ninexplicable elements which it is tempting to gloss as \u2018magic\u2019. Shuar people do speak of \nsorcery, but not as a disconnected or marginal practice but rather as one embedded in \nrelations of power operating a t individual and communal levels as well as on cosmic levels \nbeyond the ordinarily apparent plane of reality. As such, sorcery in Nangaritza cannot be \nreduced to a simple fear of being envied, explained away as the result of an instinct of \nprimitive egalit arianism or anti -capitalism (e.g. Taussig, 1980) that reflects \u2018widespread \nanxiety about the production and distribution of wealth,\u2019  as the Comaroffs (1999: 288) \nposit with regard to fears of witchcraft in southern Africa. Instead, the notion of sorcery \nor \u2018maldad\u2019 is an emanation of an all -encompassing worldview guiding Shuar people in the 185 \n right way to live, in the context of which \u2018maldad\u2019 can signify physical illness, psycho -\nemotional distress, familial conflict or even simply being waylaid from what is felt as one\u2019s \nproper life path. Shuar people\u2019s pursuit of visionary experiences to maintain a consistent \nconsciousness of the future in their actions in the present represents one way that the \npromise of epistemic pluralism through state interculturality m ay be realised in the Shuar \ncontext. In particular, the notion that one\u2019s health and illness have deep roots grounded \nthroughout the entirety of an individual\u2019s life and that its depths can be plumbed through \ninternally directed hallucinogenic experiences may turn out to be a profound contribution \nto western healthcare.  \nHealthcare practices founded in profound cultural difference have unfortunately been \nrelegated to the margins of the western political -economic system. The expansion of the \nsystem has brough t more and more resources to its centres of knowledge, but at the cost \nof undermining the viability of independent cultures from which alternate approaches to \nknowledge may emerge. The ontological and epistemological commitments of Shuar \npeople in Alto Nan garitza and the healing practices emerging from them are but an \nexample of what state interculturality should aim to support. This would of course be a \nboon to indigenous autonomy over dependence on North -Atlantic forms of political, \neconomic, social and e pistemic organisation. What this chapter has shown, however, is \nthat it would also be desirable for the pluralisation of knowledge production and the \nfunctioning of state social services across nation -states as a whole.   \n \n \n 186 \n Chapter 5: Medicinal Plants and  Evangelicals\u2019 Denatured Spirituality  \n \nThe preceding chapter illustrates the stark differences in worldview and conceptualisation \nof health and healing that would both challenge any effort to implement culturally \nrepresentative state healthcare, while at the same time carrying the potential for  rich \nepistemic dialogue. However, such a project does not only need to consider the dramatic \ncultural difference between specific indigenous peoples and the scientific materialism of \nstate healthcare systems constructed on the model of a modernizing Europ ean state. It \nalso needs to take into account the differences within indigenous populations, a point that \nmodels of interculturality subtly based around culture as ethnicity tend to obviate. In the \nterms of this project\u2019s case study, it is not just when sp eaking of the Shuar population in \nthe province of Zamora -Chinchipe as a whole that we encounter a problematic \ngeneralisation, for even in Alto Nangaritza there are minority positions that are clearly \ndistinct from the rest of the population. While the heal th-seeking practices of Shuar people \nin this particular region are most strongly influenced by the knowledge and practices that \nare their cultural inheritance as Shuar people, as well as the geographic isolation that has \nfacilitated its survival and autono mous development, among the Evangelical religious \nminority this inheritance has been attacked in some ways and transformed in others. The \nway in which Evangelism has both overcome and combined with existing health -seeking \nknowledge and practices in Alto Na ngaritza, and the traditional Shuar ontology on which \nthese are dependent, is the subject of the present chapter. It offers both an example of \nthe complications inherent in speaking about culturally representative state institutions, \nas well as a case of o ntological metamorphosis worthy of ethnographic analysis in its own 187 \n right. The manner in which Shuar people navigate between an indigenous animist \nontology, an aggressively monotheistic religion and the scientific and philosophically \nmaterialist practice o f state -sponsored clinical healthcare sheds a new light on the \nsimilarities and differences between these belief systems.  \nThe chapter begins by documenting the character of Evangelism as a dissident worldview, \nparticularly within Alto Nangaritza. The role of illness in throwing prior ontological \ncommitments into uncertainty is highlighted, as is the way healing has the capacity to \ncement new structures of belief. The chapter\u2019s second section explains how Evangelicals\u2019 \nsubsequent moral injunctions against ce rtain healing practices problematise the notion of \n\u2018border thinking\u2019 as \u2018localised accounts of best epistemic practices\u2019 (Alcoff, 2007: 97) \noutlined in Chapter 2. The assumption that a specific culture\u2019s health -seeking practices \nrepresent a body of accumul ated knowledge guided by criteria of efficacy does not hold \nin this case. The third section proposes to resolve this problem with the hypothesis that \nEvangelism represents a halfway position between the philosophical materialism of \nwestern science and the ancestral health -seeking practices and traditional ontology \ndetailed in Chapter 4. Finally, the final section extends upon this position by explaining \nhow Evangelical religion operates as one vector amongst many in Shuar territory and is \nonly observable in  its interactions with existing knowledge practices and with other \ncultural vectors.  \n \nHealing and Conversion: Illness as a Crisis of Ontological Commitments  \nAs detailed in Chapter 3, ten of the sixty -one interviewees in this project were Evangelical, \nand seven of these lived in and around Shaime in Alto Nangaritza. As that chapter\u2019s 188 \n statistical analysis demonstrated, their strongest predilections were the reje ction of both \nshamanism and the ingestion of hallucinogenic plants, while their willingness to engage \nwith clinical healthcare or to prefer the use of medicinal plants was mixed. This chapter \nseeks to explain these preferences from the perspective of Shuar  Evangelicals themselves. \nIt would be easy to account for the rejection of shamans and hallucinogens as the direct \noutcome of the group\u2019s religious dogma; the testimony of interviewees like An\u00edbal \nTseremp of Churubia, for example, lends itself to such a st raightforward explanation:  \nNow that I am following the Evangelists, this is called excess, because it\u2019s like a drug. It\u2019s not \na good thing if you do it when you know what it says in the Bible. For this reason, I have left \nthose things behind.  \nHowever, giv en that the number of people adhering to the tenets of Evangelism is clearly \nmuch lower than the number of people amongst whom the same ideas circulate, it is worth \nanalysing the way in which Evangelical ideas have managed to take root. In studying \nhealth -seeking behaviours, one gains a direct window into the way in which the point of \ncrisis represented by serious illness creates leverage for conversion between belief \nsystems. A pre -conversion episode in the life of Antonio Tukupi, recounted after an \nEvange lical service outside Shaime, is an example of this process:  \nBefore I came to know Jesus Christ, I travelled around, and I thought that these people \n[shamans], through all of their sorceries and witchcraft (\u2018brujer\u00edas y hechicer\u00edas\u2019), were \nworking on the side of God. One day, some sort of \u2018maldad\u2019  entered my daughter and made \nher sick. And they did so many things that they called treatments, things that only they \nunderstood, but they couldn\u2019t cure, and I was spending money too. I had to spend money to \nbe a ble to save my daughter.  \n\u2013 They charge a fair bit, no?  189 \n \u2013 They charge a lot, and there are some who lie, and they say things that are completely \nsatanic and they go around robbing and taking people\u2019s money. These \u2018brujos\u2019 take money \nfrom those who are the poorest. There are \u2018brujos\u2019 who go around saying, \u2018You are not \ngoing to be cured; you are going to die. You need this remedy.\u2019 And then they take them for \n[USD] $500 or $1,000. So what happened? My daughter couldn\u2019t get well. I took her to a \n\u2018brujo.\u2019 He wa s too much. He knew everything! But even he could not make my daughter \nhealthy.  \n\u2013 Did you go to see a lot of healers?  \n\u2013 Yes. I went to one in Macas, Puyo, El Pangui, so many, so I know.  \n\u2013 And did they give you a lot of different explanations?  \n\u2013 Yes. They  would say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s like this; it\u2019s your fellow human beings, they\u2019re killing her,\u2019 or \nwhatever, in that way that they speak. But in the end, my daughter couldn\u2019t be cured and \nshe died, and went to another place, perhaps.  \nSo I set myself to thinking a lo t. I had been rejecting the word of God at this time. I was Catholic \nat this point. And I fell into conversation with a priest during this time. And I learned the \nwords, \u2018He who believes in me will no longer be condemned by God. And he who does not \nbelieve  is condemned. And when you don\u2019t have money coming from anywhere, call out to \nme and I will answer you.\u2019  \nAnd so I was thinking and analysing everything during this time. And it says as well, \u2018With \nprayer, your sick will be cured.\u2019 So if God had died for my sin, why should I believe in a man \nwho is just as sinful as I am [i.e. a shaman]? So I prayed to the Lord: \u201cLord, from now on I will \nreject these sorceries (\u2018brujer\u00edas\u2019), because these are simply devil -worshippers (\u2018son puros \nsat\u00e1nicos\u2019) who go around r obbing money.\u201d Jesus Christ healed and he never charged a cent! \nSt John the Baptist baptised and never charged anything for it.  190 \n But the \u2018brujos\u2019  go around, and even just for a consultation they charge $5. If there are two of \nyou, they charge $10. They rob a lot of money. I had paid $150! They lie, they charge you and \nthey take your money. So in \u2018brujer\u00edas\u2019  I won\u2019t believe anything. I have left this behind and I\u2019m \nin the hands of the Lord.  \nAntonio\u2019s testimony illustrates the impact of the vagaries of sicknes s and health on \nindividuals\u2019 fundamental beliefs. Before his daughter\u2019s fatal illness, he would certainly have \nalready been aware of Evangelicals\u2019 prohibition against involvement with shamans and the \nintoxicating substances of which they make use. However,  it seems that if even one of the \nmany shamans whom Antonio visited had managed to cure his daughter, the conversion \nto Evangelism from Catholicism would never have taken place. It is a classic example of \nthe role of illness as an intimate mystery that ser ves to foreground our inability to exercise \ncontrol over even that which is most central to our existence. As Jean Comaroff (1982: 51) \nputs it, the paradox of illness is that our bodies become both self and other. In the context \nof a region of Shuar settle ment dominated by the health -seeking practices founded on \ntraditional ontology and its associated practices of vision -seeking and shamanic healing, \nthe health -seeking behaviour of Evangelicals could be characterised as a dissident reaction \nto its inevitabl e failings.  \nWhile illness has the potential to trigger such moments of crisis, its tendency toward self -\nresolution in unexpected and speedy healing can also be harnessed to reinforce \nontological postulates. During an Evangelical service outside Shaime in 2 013, the apogee \nof the pastor\u2019s performance arrived in a recount of his own experience of severe illness.  \nI went to see the shamans, and they said that they had the medicine to cure me. However \nthese were simply sedatives (\u2018calmantes\u2019). I was given a balm and I used it exactly as I was \nsupposed to. However, my body reacted and got even worse. I threw it away and said, \u2018This 191 \n is garbage. From now on, I am only going to believe in God.\u2019 And the miracle happened right \nthen. I was cured right away. My illness we nt away.  \nYet God reprehended me at the same time, and I was forced to stay in bed. During this time, \nI saw two angels. During my time as a Catholic, I never saw angels. And these angels were \nwearing such white clothes. The white that we see people wearing cannot be compared to \nwhat I saw. I heard the voice of the angels. They walked up to me and touched me. One said, \n\u2018Lift up this sick person who is in bed.\u2019 In the Catholic religion, they say that God will not speak \nto you, but I learned that he does.  \nInter estingly, the pastor used the very same term, \u2018calmantes\u2019, in his dismissal of the \nhealing capacities of shamans as the majority of Shuar people in Alto Nangaritza do in \nexpressing their skepticism with regard to clinical medicine. It is as though, whether  for \nCatholics or Evangelicals, the expectation for a healing practice to be considered as \nfounded on truth implies that the treatment is able to go immediately to the core of the \nproblem and resolve it, rather than simply improve the patient\u2019s condition i n an \nincremental way. The pastor thereby challenges the legitimacy of shamanism and \nreinforces that of his own preferred alternative by claiming that prayer and submission to \nGod have greater power over the never -quite -knowable terrain of our bodies. In th is case, \nthen, cultural change is certainly dependent on the slow diffusion of ideas via the global \nnetwork of Protestant Evangelism, but is effected by a health crisis and the lack of efficacy \nof the previously preferred form of healing practice. In contr ast, then, to Libbet Crandon -\nMalamud\u2019s (1991) thesis that medical decisions are often made for political reasons and as \nassertions of identity, in this case a political decision and an attendant shift in identity \noccurs for a medical reason. The fraught pe riod surrounding a search for healing can be \ncompared to the moment of observation in quantum physics, when one option among a 192 \n pre-existing set of possibilities is finally concretised. In this sense, health -seeking \nbehaviour is one way in which cultural ch ange is made manifest.  \nHowever, although such dramatic moments of direct conversion clearly occur, the \nethnographic scene among Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe is not, precisely speaking, \none of knowledge systems in direct competition. As was occurring a  century ago with the \narrival of Catholic missionaries in Shuar ancestral territory, cultures and their foundational \npremises inevitably enter a dialogue out of which at least within the theatre in question, \nneither remains unchanged.50 In today\u2019s ontologic al encounter, the Evangelism of Shuar \npeople is coloured by their historically imbued expectation that the paramount form of \ntruth is the transcendental experience of vision. The importance of visions to Evangelical \nShuar was one of the curious facts that emerged in the statistical analysis of interviewees\u2019 \nresponses, as presented in Chapter 3, and it remains true in spite of the virulent \nexpressions of hostility occasionally heard from Evangelists regarding the methods of \nachieving visionary transcendence employed by their recently deceased ancestors. One of \nthe most outspoken Evangelists in this regard was Elsa Tukupi, a middle -aged \ngrandmother who lived an hour\u2019s walk further up the Nangaritza River from Shaime. Elsa \ndescribed a personal experience of sic kness and healing as follows:  \nA spirit of the world (\u2018esp\u00edritu del mundo\u2019) entered me, the witchcraft of a witch -doctor \n(\u2018brujo\u2019), doing \u2018maldad\u2019. I was already on the path of being Evangelical at this time. So what \ncould I do? The only thing I could do w as cast my gaze up to God in heaven, praying and \nfasting. Then, in a dream, a \u2018Se\u00f1or\u2019 arrived, just like yourself [a white man], the demeanour \n                                                        \n50 Recall Casper Jensen and Atsuro Morita\u2019s observation that \u2018different ontologies are often busily \ninterfering with each other [\u2026] ontologies are neve r hermetically sealed but always part of multiple \nengagements\u2019 (2012: 366).  193 \n and everything. He appeared to me and said that he was an Evangelist. He spoke to me and \nmade exhortations.  \n\u2018I am an Evangelist,\u2019 he was saying. \u2018I am the one who heals the sick. I don\u2019t heal with remedies, \nwith anything.\u2019 And as he made these exhortations, I was struck down by a powerful wind. \nThis cleansed me, via this dream. And after this, pah! , I awoke. My head  had been hurting me: \nmy head, body, belly, everything. Then, nothing! I didn\u2019t feel any pain at all when I woke up. \nAll the pain left me.  \nElsa\u2019s account highlights what might be called the permeation of the subconscious with \nthe imagery of power of the ex ternal world. Just as for the Evangelical pastor, the arbitrary \nidea of whiteness as a transcendentally powerful element informed a non -verbal, bodily \nexperience of catharsis that occurred during a health crisis. A vision experienced by Estalin \nTaasham, a Catholic, after ingesting datura, demonstrated this same characteristic:   \n\u2013 No, I drank it [datura] when I was injured here [indicating his foot] and it cured me. In \ndreams I saw doctors coming to help me and the next day I woke up healthy.  \n\u2013 You applied it to your skin [also]?  \n\u2013 Yes, on the skin. That\u2019s how I was cured.  \n\u2013 What were the doctors like, that you saw?  \n\u2013 They were white people and they came here and cured me.  \n\u2013 Were they white men like me?  \n\u2013 Yes, that is how they were. They were the force (\u2018fuerza\u2019) of the plant, that is to say the \nspirit (\u2018esp\u00edritu\u2019) of the plant, which came and cured me. By the second day I was cured.  \n\u2013 And it was a bad injury? When you did it, could you walk?  \n\u2013 Yes it was. I couldn\u2019t walk. And with this plant I was cure d. 194 \n Thus, despite their diverging methods, with Elsa having prayed and fasted while Estalin \nconsumed a powerful hallucinogen, their healing visions were very similar. The principal \ndifference lies in the character of their saviours: Estalin\u2019s were identifia ble beings and \ncohabitants in his own world, who can be easily located as the spirit of a specific plant even \nas they took on the form of doctors in order to heal. Datura is widely referred to as \u2018the \ndoctor\u2019 by Shuar people throughout the province. By con trast, in Elsa\u2019s vision, the white \nEvangelist seemingly arrived from nowhere in response to her supplication; his identity, \nmotivation and provenance remained unknown to her.  \nA point worth clarifying: when Elsa asks rhetorically, \u2018What could I do?\u2019, she re ferences the \nfact that the obvious recourse upon suffering \u2018maldad\u2019 would be to seek treatment from \na shaman, if only she had not already distanced herself from their practice by converting \nto Evangelism. What this means is that, in contrast to the motivat ions that appeared to \nguide Antonio, the rejection of shamanism by Evangelists is not necessarily based on the \nconviction that shamans\u2019 pretensions at healing are a sham. Their opposition may be based \non more complex grounds than dismissing the efficacy of  their practice.  \n \n\u2018False Miracles\u2019: Evangelism as a Moral Epistemology?  \nWe saw in Chapter 3 that Evangelicals commonly claimed that shamans were \u2018Satanic\u2019 or \n\u2018worked with the Devil.\u2019 These terms in and of themselves, however, read as a base \ncondemnation o f evil that fails to do justice to the complexity of Evangelicals\u2019 contentions \nabout the nature of shamanic healing. When I asked the Shuar Evangelical pastor about \nshamans\u2019 claim that they heal in collaboration with God, he responded as follows:  195 \n \u2013 No! Be fore, we used to believe this, but it does not say this in the Bible. Jesus says nothing \nabout this. My sister, who has now been converted to Christ, she was performing this type \nof \u2018magia.\u2019  She tells about how Satan was using her as an instrument. And she  would tell \nabout how she would touch a sick person and they would be cured. But these are false \nmiracles. Through false powers and Satan, many people are cured. And for want of reading \nthe Bible, people get confused. It\u2019s certain to them. They are convinc ed. But for those of us \nwho have read the Bible, we realise that this is not the case.  \n\u2013 So you\u2019re saying that they can cure through Satan?  \n\u2013 Yes. Satan performs miracles. However, they are false. God himself cures. I myself have \nbeen cured by God.  \nSo ev en though Evangelicals justify their sense of the legitimacy of the Biblical God on \nstories of divine intervention to heal the sick, they are not dismissing shamanism by \narguing that shamans cannot heal. Instead they argue that shamanic healing is somehow \nwrong or \u2018false\u2019 in some other way. This may seem incoherent, but the key is to accept that \nit is founded upon a distinct sort of epistemology to that which is intuitively logical to a \nsecular western audience. Instead of judging the validity of a belief b ased on its capacity \nto predict and be consistent with observation, without heeding ethical considerations, \nsome Shuar people evidently have a broader set of criteria to judge a belief\u2019s legitimacy; \nor, more to the point, its desirability. The following pa ssage in an interview which involved \nboth Martina and Elsa Tukupi offers a glimpse of these criteria. When I asked their \nthoughts on Shuar ancestral beliefs, Martina replied as follows, with Elsa in agreement:  \nThis power [ Ar\u00fatam ] was Satanic. It was not f rom God. Our grandparents had the custom of \ngoing to the waterfall; they inhaled tobacco juice through their nostrils; they slept in the \nforest, at the waterfall. They wanted to catch a spirit (\u2018coger un esp\u00edritu\u2019) and see God, as they 196 \n thought. In this dru nkenness (\u2018borrachera\u2019), they found power. They would say, \u2018I \nencountered a jaguar, which presented itself to me, but I mastered it. It transformed into a \nperson and spoke to me, so that I may live and so that I may kill my enemy. And now I am very \ncertain /safe (\u201cseguro\u201d) because I have to kill and nobody can kill me.\u2019 This power that they \nattained was not a power from God. It was a power of the Devil. So the people were very \nconfused, because they called Ar\u00fatam God. But God does not say, \u2018Kill your brother .\u2019 \nThe two women\u2019s interpretation is consistent with that of the pastor in the sense that they \ndo not dispute the veracity of the practice they criticise: in this case, that of finding vision \nand power by ingesting hallucinogenic plants by a waterfall in the manner of their parents \nand grandparents. They criticise it on the grounds of moral desirability, not ontological \nlegitimacy. This position does not change when killing is taken out of the equation; as the \npastor\u2019s testimony makes clear, even healing the s ick can go against their version of \nBiblical morality. These examples in fact call into question the project of comparative study \nof epistemologies itself: if there is no universal cross -cultural commitment to obtaining \nknowledge about reality that is unqu alified with moral concerns, how meaningful is it to \nspeak of epistemologies in the plural?    \nOne way of explaining this apparent paradox is that Protestant Evangelism demands a \nparticular way for human beings to relate to the experience of transcending t he ordinarily \napparent layer of reality. There appears to be a demand for the abnegation of spiritual \nagency in the way in which certain spiritual practices are either favoured or held in \ndisrepute. This emerges in the position one is expected to adopt whe n exercising the \ncentral element of healing according to Evangelical beliefs: prayer. According to Elsa \nTukupi:  197 \n I always tell my sisters, \u2018When you need to be cured, go first to God.\u2019 Because the Bible says \nthe \u2018maldad\u2019 that enters your body can only be r emoved by fasting and praying. One has to \npray. It is the same with the head of the church. He has to pray. It\u2019s not that he as a person is \ncapable of curing on his own; rather, through this person the prayer to God comes back down \nfrom heaven and heals. I t removes the illness. But when one doesn\u2019t have faith, one cannot \nbe healed. For this reason, one must have faith in God. This is also an opportunity for you, \nbecause all of us need God in our lives.  \nWhat is notable here is the organisation of both an ega litarianism and a hierarchy in \nspiritual worth. An Evangelical pastor, or any kind of \u2018head of the church,\u2019 is not situated \nin a superior position to others with respect to spiritual agency, as represented in the \nManichean quest for health and the banishme nt of illness.51 At the same time, this equality \nis the product of a permanent hierarchy of spiritual power with respect to God, the one \nand only morally legitimate force beyond the normally visible world. The limit of human \nspiritual agency is to petition God to heal, according to the Evangelicals, from a position of \nsupplication and faith. Even then, God may legitimately toy with human hopes; as the \npastor related, \u2018Sometimes, God tests a man by sending him sickness. And through this \nillness, God disciplin es, in order to know if God is in his heart.\u2019 Thus, while not contesting \nthe ontological veracity of other forces of healing which originate on normally invisible \nplanes of reality, Evangelism establishes a very different, subordinate form of ideal human \nsubjectivity with respect to such forces than does traditional Shuar ontology and the \nhealing and vision -seeking practices originating in it. Evangelism\u2019s \u2018epistemology,\u2019 so to \n                                                        \n51 The Evangelical pastor stressed to me that \u2018the Bible says, in Romans 7:23, \u201cThe payment for sin is \ndeath.\u201d [\u2026] The consequence of sin is sickness. Disobedience, it\u2019s a sin. Disb elief, it\u2019s a sin.\u2019  198 \n speak, is thus imbricated with ethical concerns about the hierarchical order of the universe \nand the degree to which humankind should express its full capacities.  \nA similar finding on the hierarchy of legitimate agency in Evangelical thought can be found \nin Kimberley Marshall\u2019s thematically parallel research carried out among Navajo \nEvangelical (\u2018Pentecostal\u2019) church adherents in New Mexico. Marshall argues that for this \ncommunity of believers, \u2018prayers are requests\u2019; moreover, \u2018the efficacy of prayers also lies \nfully in the hands of God, and unanswered prayers are often explained wit h reference to \n\u201cthe will of God\u201d\u2019 (2015: 405). By contrast, in traditional Navajo spirituality, engagement \nwith spirits existing on non -ordinary planes of reality was governed by \u2018social norms of \nreciprocity\u2019 (2015: 405). This difference mirrors that found  between Shuar Evangelicals and \nthe Shuar Catholics living according to a more traditional worldview. The former make \npetitions to an unknowable God, while the latter refer to vision -inducing medicinal plants \nas having \u2018a living spirit\u2019 or as \u2018doctor,\u2019 and  as plants which \u2018cannot be collected just for the \nsake of collecting them.\u2019 In the same vein, Navajo Evangelicals consider \u2018all the good things \nin life\u2019 as \u2018blessings\u2019 which are received as \u2018gifts from God in response to petitions\u2019 (2015: \n405). From a tra ditional Navajo perspective, by contrast, \u2018a state of blessedness is the \nresponsibility of humans to maintain. It is the result of proper functioning of the world, \nwhich was set up in ancient times, and can be restored through ritual\u2019 (2015: 406). Though \nsuch notions of ritual and reverence for the past are absent in the individualistic practices \nof Shuar spirituality, as we have seen in Chapter 4 such ideals as virtue, strength, good \nfortune and resistance to hardship are to be achieved by fearlessly pursu ing visionary \nexperiences, and not by supplication before any omnipotent being(s). Moreover, these \nideals, while they certainly have moral valency, are more valued as guideposts to the most \neffective way to live and prosper. Shuar Evangelicals, on the othe r hand, speak incessantly 199 \n of \u2018faith,\u2019 which is the explanation for good fortune and the required response to adversity; \nand are at times more concerned with the purity of their souls in the afterlife than they are \nwith the effectiveness of their actions in  the present.  \n \nMedicinal Plants, Materialism and the Disowning of Spiritual Agency  \nThis paradigm does not necessitate an entirely fatalistic attitude toward illness that would \nleave human beings with no recourse except prayer. Almost all of the Evangelical s with \nwhom I spoke supported the use of medicinal plants. For some, this was a matter of \ncultural pride and asserting indigenous identity, a subject to be addressed in Chapter 7. For \nothers, treatment of illness with medicinal plants was seen as according  with the intention \nof God in placing such plants on the Earth, as the Evangelical pastor and his wife confirmed. \n(These two positions were by no means exclusive.) This perspective was also evident in \nKiim, a small town built around a church in which there  were no shamans present. As one \nwoman living there who was very knowledgeable about medicinal plants put it: \u2018Never say \nthat I am a witch -doctor (\u201cbruja\u201d) or that I am a shaman (\u201ccurandera\u201d). Behind me, there \nis someone who intercedes on my behalf. There is the Lord, who left us the medicinal \nplants, then there is me.\u2019   \nThe way in which Evangelicals relate to hallucinogenic plants is revealing of the way in \nwhich medicinal plants and healing in general are situated in Evangelicals\u2019 worldview, as \nthese plan ts are widely regarded as having physiologically therapeutic characteristics \nindependent of the capacity to induce visions. Again, Martina and Elsa Tukupi\u2019s interview \nbrought the matter to light most explicitly. After hearing about their rejection of ances tral \npractices of seeking visions of Ar\u00fatam , I asked the following:  200 \n Q \u2013 Does this apply also to nat\u00e9m , tsaank , and maikiua ?  \nE \u2013 We do not do this. Well\u2026simply as remedies, yes. When one has a wound, to simply \napply it [ maikiua ], then yes, but not\u2026  \nM \u2013 For injuries, it can be applied.  \nE \u2013 For fever, one can also take the leaves of nat\u00e9m and bathe with them [the leaves are \nmixed with water in a bucket, which is then used to bathe].  \nQ \u2013 But they are not used for acquiring power from visions?  \nM \u2013 No.  \nE \u2013 This power from visions can only be given by God.  \nQ \u2013 Through prayer, for example?  \nE \u2013 For example, for myself, God has made me see. If I have a brother who is not walking in \nthe path of Christ, God sends me a vision to show me. So then, I have to speak  with him, and \ntell him, \u2018God is saying that you are going in this direction, and you are putting yourself in \ndanger. You need to take more care.\u2019 If God gives a vision, it lives.  \nIn other words, these plants with the capacity to provoke a spiritual or vis ionary \nexperience have this characteristic specifically neglected by Evangelicals in favour of \nmaking use of only those phytochemical properties that affect the body. They did not \nconsider that the plants could either explain the nature of an illness to th em, as non -\nEvangelicals residents of Shaime say with regard to ayahuasca; nor did they consider \nthat one should drink datura in order to experience healing at the hands of the spirit of \nthat plant (the so -called \u2018doctor\u2019). Evangelical healing preferences t hus manifested a \nCartesian logic. For them, God is the only legitimate source of the transcendent \nknowledge that emerges from the layers of reality beyond the ordinarily visible world; \npractices that imply the intelligence, agency or intentionality of any other entity on these \nlevels of reality are to be opposed as moral perversions, despite their potential efficacy.  201 \n As such, it appears to be the specific nature of Evangelical spirituality that encourages \nthe Weberian \u2018disenchantment\u2019 of indigenous ontolog y, rather than the incidental \nsecular attitudes of missionaries, as Elmer Miller (1970) suggested. Although theirs is \nobviously a religious worldview, in practice the aggressive monotheism of the \nEvangelicals serves as a halfway point between philosophical  materialism and the \nanimated cosmos of indigenous Shuar ontology. The majority practice in Alto Nangaritza \nof communicating with beings that exist beyond the normally visible plane of reality is \neven more rabidly opposed by Shuar Evangelicals than by stat e medical personnel, even \nthough the latter dismiss the ontological validity of such encounters altogether. The \nformer\u2019s moral indignation contrasts with the calm agnosticism of the latter with regard \nto Shuar healing practices as a whole. In the words of one of the regular doctors at the \nclinic in Shaime, \u2018We can hardly tell them not to use their own medicine. It\u2019s not as \nthough we have studies to say that the plants they use don\u2019t work.\u2019  \nBy contrast, seeing ordinary invisible layers of reality as real, t hey become all the more \nfrightening to Evangelicals, whose monotheism leads them to interpret all spiritual \nentities external to the singularity of God as demonic emanations of Satan. In such a \nworldview, one is left with simply the works of the Creator an d humankind, to whom \nCreation was left to be shepherded.52 Given that the other elements of the world have \nno agency, personality or individuality of their own, they can be classified and \nmanipulated according to their universal qualities and natural laws, with only the \nadditional element of faith in the Creator himself required to activate them in the \nsought -after direction. With humankind left to its own devices between a distant God \n                                                        \n52 This argument relating the western will to dominate nature to Biblical mythology has also been \ndeveloped by Kichwa intellectual Luis Maldonado Ruiz (2010: 84).  202 \n and the materiality of the world, it is just one step further to do away with the element \nof faith altogether, putting man\u2019s knowledge of the Creation in the place of the will of \nthe Creator as the prime mover. In this historical trajectory, Evangelism among Shuar \npeople appears to be functioning in the same fashion as Protesta ntism in early -modern \nBritain, which disciplined folk religious practices by delegitimising minor saints and \ndirect revelation (Green Musselman, 2006: 147 -8). Ironically, then, it is possible that the \nspiritual practice of Evangelism does more to overhaul the ontology indigenous to \nZamora -Chinchipe than rationalised state institutions, whose epistemological \nconfidence and pluralistic attitude leaves its practitioners unconcerned with the details \nof the specific motivations of their clients.  \nAn indication of  this ontological metamorphosis amongst Shuar people in Zamora -\nChinchipe, whether Evangelised or simply raised in the aftermath of extensive Catholic \nmissionisation, is the aetiological typology of \u2018sicknesses of man\u2019 and \u2018sicknesses of God.\u2019 \nAs detailed i n Chapter 3, this widely shared categorisation separates sorcery and other \nillnesses caused by clashes of competing power and vision from what we would call \n\u2018naturally -occurring\u2019 illnesses. Ironically, while the former are cured by shamans, \n\u2018sicknesses of God\u2019 are cured by administering the correct medicinal agent, whether herbal \nremedies or pharmaceuticals obtained from clinical personnel. The association of God with \nwhat we could recognise as a \u2018natural causes\u2019 explanation is supportive of the notion that  \nChristian proselytising can encourage materialism in the worldview of indigenous peoples \nby distancing animist peoples from exercising spiritual agency and encouraging active \ninterventions on the material world combined only with passive spiritual supplic ation.  203 \n There is also historical supporting evidence for the proposition. In comparing this \naetiological dichotomy with the conceptualisation of illness among the Achuar people \nencountered by Philippe Descola and Anne -Christine Taylor in the late 1970s, it  would \nappear that not just the name but the entire category of \u2018sicknesses of God\u2019 arrived with \nthe Christian missionaries. As Descola observed, \u2018My companions have hardly any concept \nof there being \u201cnatural causes\u201d for pain or misfortune. Instead, they u sually consider them \nto stem from the actions of others, either involuntary or deliberate\u2019 (1996: 235). With \nregard to the usage of medicinal plants, the most favoured aspect of traditional medicine \nin international development initiatives, Descola noted, at least for the Achuar, \u2018[their] \nrelative indifference [\u2026] toward their plant remedies \u2013in total contrast, it is worth noting, \nto the mythical image of the Indians of Amazonia promoted by western enthusiasts of \n\u201calternative medicine\u201d\u2019 (1996: 237). It seems  quite likely, then, that at least for Jivaroan \npeoples, the will to use and learn about a diverse range of medicinal plants has in some \nways been encouraged by missionisation53 and Evangelism, as well as by the presence of \nindigenous identity politics.  \n \nOne Vector Amongst Many  \nThe impact of Evangelism in Zamora -Chinchipe should not be exaggerated, as Evangelism \nis but one of several cultural vectors that are influencing the worldview and practice of \nShuar people. Even amongst Evangelicals, it should not be assumed that the hold of their \nideas is total; that the cultural presuppositions they have inherited as Shuar people are \n                                                        \n53 A definite exception is women\u2019s usage of contraceptive and abortifacien t plants, whose former usage \nolder Shuar women confirm, and which a Shaime resident told me had been explicitly condemned by a \npriest during her adolescence.  204 \n being erased; or that they are not being simultaneously affected by other cultural vectors. \nOn the first point, the testimony of Elsa T ukupi manifested certain contradictions \nsuggestive of only a partial transformation in the ontology she accepted. In her words:  \nMy son too [\u2026], he got very ill as well. I suffered for him. Due to my disobedience, my father \nin heaven has taken six of my gra ndchildren away from me. So I prayed to him: \u2018Father, please \ndon\u2019t take any more grandchildren away from me. He is the only one you have left me. The \nothers that you took away, you have them now. But leave him here with me.\u2019  \nSo I fasted, and when I slept I  saw my grandchild with a needle inside him, tied around with a \nblack thread. So I said to my daughter, \u2018Why does he have this needle inside of him? Why did \nyou put this inside of him?\u2019 So I sucked it out of my grandson. And she said to me, \u2018This was \nput t here by \u201cmagia\u201d\u2019. This means that he was affected by bad spirits of the world.  \nOnce I took it out, my grandson was fine. And so I continued to pray and make requests to \nGod. In the name of God, we can make treatments, using some remedies and praying to hi m. \nThis description of a case of illness and healing is nearly identical to the kinds of examples \noffered of shamanic healing by non -Evangelical Shuar. The only difference is that in the \nlatter case the diagnostic vision would be received by a shaman under  the influence of \nnat\u00e9m , rather than in a dream sent after prayer and fasting in supplication before God. \nAside from that aspect, we see a healer perceiving a small, otherwise innocuous item \nlodged in the body of a patient, which is attributed as the cause  of the illness and the \ninstrument of an unknown, malevolent entity. Once the item is removed, the patient \nimmediately recovers. Of course, Elsa has previously told us, \u2018When you need to be cured, \ngo first to God. The Bible says that the badness that enter s your body can only be removed \nby fasting and praying.\u2019 However, the ingrained autochthonous notion of human beings as \nagents of direct healing without the need for medicines has evidently become mixed up 205 \n with the notion of petitioning God to be healed, s o as to suggest that following such \nsupplication one can heal others as well.  \nJust as the impact of culturally inherited notions of healing and ontology is manifest in the \nresponses of Evangelicals, so is the impression made by other cultural vectors, of which \nthe most prominent are the mining economy and the discourse associated with the \nPachakutik party and the broader global ideology of indigenous rights and the re -assertion \nof indigenous identity. An\u00edbal Tseremp, a waged miner and Evangelical from the town of \nChurubia, stated directly, \u2018We go to the doctor for any kind of illness.\u2019 When pressed on \nwhether he pursued any ancestral healing practices, he replied, \u2018We don\u2019t apply this, \nbecause we have medicines and hospitals.\u2019 This preference for clinical m edical attention \nwas common amongst waged miners, none of whom rejected clinical medicine outright. \nBy contrast, as we saw in Chapter 3, among Evangelicals in Shaime there was deep \nsuspicion of state health clinics; one of the men insisted that the injecti ons and serums \nused were designed to kill people. Similarly, there were Evangelical and Catholic \ninterviewees alike who would inveigh against non -native foods as the cause of much of \nthe illness suffered by Shuar people, while invoking the diet and healing  practices of their \nancestors as a model of health and healing in rousing assertions of indigenous identity.  \nAs such, we might speak of cultural vectors as having a particular modality indicating their \nterrain on which their impact is focused. In the case  of Evangelism, its terrain is ontological: \nit brings a moral charge to questions of ontology, such that even activities with observable \npositive effects may be condemned on ethical grounds. This was apparent in the \nEvangelical pastor\u2019s opposition to the \u2018 false miracles\u2019 of shamans who succeed in healing \ntheir patients by collaborating with Satan, and An\u00edbal Tseremp himself provides another 206 \n illustrative example. When asked about his experiences with ayahuasca, An\u00edbal related the \nfollowing:  \n\u2013 Did you just d rink it out of curiosity?  \n\u2013 Yes. People said it was very good. One sees visions and I wanted to see too, to see if it was \ntrue, a sort of experiment. It is true, what they say. You see visions on a screen, the things \nthat are going to happen and that have  to happen. When one sees something, it becomes \ntrue [later]. It is true. That\u2019s what I can tell you.  \nYet despite attributing this fantastical quality to the plant, An\u00edbal was nevertheless \nopposed to the use of it. As we saw earlier in this chapter, he ha d decided that \u2018[i]t\u2019s not a \ngood thing if you do it when you know what it says in the Bible.\u2019  \nAt the same time, despite its impact on ontological terrain, when it comes to the terrain of \nrelations with the outside world and the organisation of time and labour, Evangelism \nleaves such matters essentially untouched. As such, it is imprecise to speak o f Evangelism \nin broad terms as an agent of colonialism or acculturation. Evangelism is a significant \ncomplication to any project of state intercultural healthcare in Shuar territory because of \nthe moral invective it reserves for practices and beliefs that are fundamental to traditional \nShuar health -seeking behaviour. Its reach can be understood because of the leverage it \nfinds among Shuar people who have experienced suffering and loss and seek a means to \nexpress a dissident response to the traditional ontol ogy and practices that ought to have \nempowered them. As such, there is an oppositional stance inherent in their worldview that \nsuggests there to be little potential for articulating their health -seeking preferences in \nshared institutions with those of Cath olic Shuar in geographically remote regions.  207 \n In sum, the Evangelical presence would need to be considered by any intercultural health \ninitiative undertaken in Shuar territory. Healthcare institutions operating according to the \nhealth -seeking preferences a nd traditional ontology of Shuar people living in remote \nregions could not be said to be culturally representative of Evangelical Shuar. At the same \ntime, Evangelical health -seeking preferences are essentially oppositional; with their \nemphasis on administe ring herbal or pharmaceutical medicinal agents in conjunction with \nsupplication before God, Evangelicals are not substantially different from mestizo \nEcuadorians and other westerners in the kind of medical expertise they expect and \nrequire. This perspectiv e is driven, as we have seen, by Evangelism as a response to failures \nin traditional healing, and in the subsequently morally charged injunctions against \nshamanism and all forms of agency on the plane of non -ordinary levels of reality, which are \nseen as th e proper domain of God. In picturing the world as a material plane ruled over by \na distant, singular deity, Evangelists are in fact only a small step from the worldview of \nphilosophical materialism. As such, Evangelicals\u2019 health -seeking preferences do not \ndemand the reformulation of state healthcare institutions along intercultural lines, \nalthough they could be expected to virulently oppose support for shamanism and \nvisionary practices of education, socialisation and self -development on the part of Shuar -\ncontrolled intercultural state health institutions. By the same token, there are other \nregions of Shuar territory where geographic isolation and the ancestral Shuar cultural \ninheritance are not as significant as in Alto Nangaritza, and where the political an d \neconomic vectors that exert influence may find greater compatibility with Evangelism, as \nwe shall see in the following chapter.  \n 208 \n Chapter 6: Mining, Materialism and the Indigenous Amazonian Working -Class  \n \nEthnography on the Quimi River: Shuar Life \u2018On -the-Grid\u2019  \nPerhaps by virtue of his pre -existing expertise in other fields, Michael Taussig was more \nready than most anthropologists before him to draw attention to social research\u2019s \n\u2018\u201cobjectivist fiction,\u201d namely, the contrived manner by which objectivity is created, and its \nprofound dependence on the magic of style to make this trick of truth work\u2019 (1987: 37). It \nis a fact worth drawing attention to here as well, in the aftermath of two chapters \nsynthesised primarily from the accounts of Shuar residents of th e beautiful and remote \nUpper Nangaritza Basin. Social science, like any human endeavour, can be motivated by \nresearchers\u2019 profoundly suspect, internalised analytical categories, which particularly for \nwesterners exposed to environmentalist discourse includ es a love of \u2018nature,\u2019 adventure \nand the challenge of going \u2018off -the-grid.\u2019 Such research sites may provide a more \nrewarding base for the study of cultural, ontological and epistemological difference than \nthe minutiae of ethnographic studies of sub -culture s within western contexts. However, \nthey also risk reproducing the very same dualism of thought \u2013opposing civilisation to \nnature and indigeneity \u2013that makes hiking through the mud three days\u2019 distance from \nmobile phone reception so viscerally appealing.  \nIt was the awareness of this unfortunate fact and its role in the present study that drove \nthe move in ethnographic location from Alto Nangaritza to the Quimi River Valley, to the \nnorth of the Ecuadorian province of Zamora -Chinchipe (see Figure 1). From one o f the most \ngeographically and culturally remote regions of the country, where few residents had \nmastered Spanish, the focus shifted to an area where the money economy took 209 \n precedence over the subsistence economy, where only those over the age of forty spok e \nthe Shuar language and where it was not uncommon to see satellite TV dishes on the \nrooves of indigenous peoples\u2019 homes.  \nThere are two Shuar \u2018centros\u2019 in the valley: Yanua, a settlement made up of a single \nextended family with a population of about fifty ; and Churubia, a legally singular \u2018centro\u2019 \nwith three separate nuclei and a population of around 95 individuals, some 30 minutes\u2019 \nwalk further up the valley. The present research includes 28 interviewees from the valley, \n12 of whom were waged miners and a nother five of whom were \u2018artisan\u2019 miners. Of the \n28, 14 were residents of Yanua and 14 were residents of Churubia. The difference in the \npattern of responses between the waged miners and the other interviewees \u2013particular \nthose few not involved in any sort  of mining \u2013was very obvious; in terms of worldview and \nhealth -seeking behaviours, most of the latter seemed to bear more in common with \nresidents of Alto Nangaritza than with their own neighbours.  \nThe socio -cultural terrain of the Quimi Valley is shaped by  the Mirador mine, a so -called \n\u2018mega -project\u2019 of socialist development and international resource extraction to which \nbusloads of workers would roll in before dawn and leave in the afternoon, along with the \nChinese and Ecuadorian engineers and translators who arrived and left in pick -up trucks \non their own schedule. All of this traffic relied on a road of pressed clay and gravel a lane \nand a half wide, which in turn relied on an 80 metre -long, two -lane wide concrete bridge \nbuilt over the Zamora River in 201 1. Although the mine was dependent on this labour force \nbussed in from elsewhere in the province, it also drew substantial involvement from local \nShuar and mestizo men. As stated in Chapter 3, miners were paid USD $480 monthly, some \n40 percent above the Ec uadorian minimum wage, for working a 15 days -on/15 days -off 210 \n schedule. On workdays, they would leave home in the morning and return some 10 hours \nlater, after completing the 90 -minute round -trip to the mine on foot. This schedule allowed \nthe men to make a l iving wage with ample time off, and this was typically spent on leisure, \n\u2018artisan\u2019 mining and maintaining the small gardens where their wives grew plantains and \ncassava near their homes. Although most households had some sort of garden, mining \nhouseholds p rimarily consumed store -bought goods, most prominently rice, beans, eggs \nand canned fish.  \nFigure 8: Newly constructed bridge on the road to Yanua and Churubia  \n \nThose who extended themselves into \u2018artisan\u2019 mining enjoyed an even stronger economic \nposition , albeit without the protection of the law. Though a strong element of chance was \ninvolved, \u2018artisan\u2019 miners reported being able to collect a gram of gold in one to two hours, \n211 \n which at 2014 prices equated to approximately USD $150 \u2013$300 per day, or roughly $4,000 \nper month, some 75 percent of Ecuador\u2019s per annum GDP per capita. Though this work \nalso necessitated locating suitable mining sites and shifting heavy machinery, as well as \ntravelling to major cities to sell their product (trips which other Shuar pe ople frequently \njoked were highly debaucherous), \u2018artisan\u2019 miners nonetheless sustained a very high \nincome by local standards.   \nThe economic prospects offered by mining are very fortunate for the current generation \nof young Shuar families of the Quimi Val ley in light of the Balkanisation of their ancestral \nterritory caused by mestizo colonisation. Both Yanua and Churubia are very small \ncommunally -titled properties completely occupied with houses, gardens, marshes, cattle \npastures, corn fields and a soccer pitch. The territory could certainly be made more \nagriculturally productive, but that would necessitate overturning a land ownership regime \nthat permits the older generation to dedicate space to cattle pasture while young adults \ncontrol no land at all. Out side of these Shuar towns, the surrounding valley is already \ndotted with houses and farmland owned by mestizos, who themselves primarily maintain \npasture and raise cattle. The arrival of mining in the valley, then, permits young Shuar \npeople to remain on c ommunally -titled land and live rent - and debt -free, even as it poses \nthe threat of potentially contaminating the water supply to such an extent that living in \nthe valley would become untenable.  \nThis kind of consideration of indigenous people\u2019s relations t o land and capital are often \nabsent in general treatments of the political emergence of indigenous peoples as such \nover the past three decades. Both academic research and political commentary tend to \noverestimate the autonomy of the indigenous peoples of L atin America, as though the 212 \n mere existence of indigenous land rights in the legal codes of the region\u2019s republics \nenables them to act as independent social units. Particularly in the immediate aftermath \nof the fall of the Berlin Wall and then the Zapatista  Rebellion in 1994, this analytical \nsimplification facilitated the conceptualisation of \u2018indigenous people\u2019 as the new \nrevolutionary protagonists: invoked as a \u2018third way\u2019 supposedly outside of the classical \nMarxist contradiction determined by the relation ship to capital and the capitalist world -\nsystem (e.g. D\u00e1valos, 2016: 23; Mignolo, 2005b: 123);54 and often simultaneously invoked \nas an environmentalist vanguard resisting the \u2018extractivism\u2019 of governments of a variety \nof ideological orientations (e.g. Gudy nas, 2013; Picq, 2014), in a manner that makes no \nreference to any alternative economic modality that may be harnessed by indigenous \npeople in order to supersede \u2018the extractivist development model\u2019 (e.g. Postero & \nFabricant, 2015: 468 -9). The fact that in digenous social units are cross -cut by various \nfactors \u2013what I have been referring to as cultural vectors \u2013in a fashion that is usually very \nsimilar to that experienced by mestizo neighbours in their immediate vicinity is overlooked \nin favour of deceptive ge neralisations about the socio -economic reality and political role \nof \u2018indigenous people(s)\u2019 and the social movements and political parties claiming to \nrepresent them.  \nIn seeking to explain the considerable divergence in health -seeking practices between \nShuar miners in the Quimi River Valley and the Shuar of Alto Nangaritza, the present \nchapter aims to present a more empirically grounded and theoretically nuanced view. \n                                                        \n54 My concern is with Mignolo\u2019s positioning of indigenous groups as a resource of pure exteriority,  \u2018a whole \nand entire world beyond the totalizing effect of the four modern meta -narratives\u2019 (2005b: 123), rather than \nwith his geopolitics of knowledge critique as such. See also Domingues\u2019s critique: \u2018While the emergence of \nindigenous peoples\u2019 movements [ \u2026] is, appropriately enough, a key concern in Mignolo\u2019s work [\u2026] \nplacing such movements outside modernity is, however, mistaken\u2019 (2009: 124).  213 \n Taking the data presented in Chapter 3 as the point of departure, this chapter first pres ents \nminers\u2019 first -hand accounts and perceptions of shamanic healing and ancestral vision -\nseeking practices, which stand in contradistinction both to anthropology\u2019s skepticism of \nshamanism as a knowledge practice and to romanticised invocations of indigene ity as a \ncontemporary subjectivity. The chapter then moves into a consideration of the prevalence \nof medicinal plant usage, the analysis of which illustrates the interplay of the coercive \npower of macro -economic conditions and the discourses and subjectivi ties of indigeneity \nand modernity/progress. In detailing the role of these exogenous cultural vectors in \ngenerating intracultural diversity, unavoidable questions are raised about the viability of \ninterculturality when tacitly defined along ethnic (or so -called \u2018ethno -cultural\u2019) lines; about \nthe complexity of reforming state institutions in the direction of cultural \nrepresentativeness; and about the uneven necessity to do so in light of the impacts of \nvarying material and discursive regimes.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 214 \n Figur e 9: House on Shuar communally -titled land near the Quimi River  \n \nPerceptions of Shamanic Healing among Miners and Anthropologists  \nAs we saw in Chapter 3, interviewees in waged mining households tended not to \nparticipate in ancestral practices of shamanic healing, sorcery and vision -seeking. In \nresponse to a query about whether he visited shamans for advice and treatments, Facundo \nKayuk replied, \u2018I\u2019ve never been one to do this.\u2019 More pointedly, his wife Genesis Kayap said, \n\u2018I don\u2019t even know what a shaman is.\u2019 Another miner, An\u00edbal Tseremp, replied, \u2018I\u2019m \nEvangelical, for the last 12 years. I practise what it says in the Bible. So I\u2019ve left behind \neverything to do with shamans and \u201ccuranderos\u201d.\u2019 As mentioned in Chapter 3, when \nNorma Tsakimp was asked whether she had sought out a shaman for a case of \u2018maldad\u2019 or \nany other reason, she responded, \u2018I\u2019ve never believed in such things.\u2019 Mateo Tsakimp said, \n215 \n \u2018Look, for us, we don\u2019t have this belief. I have a girl who is 12 years old now, and she\u2019s never \ngot sick with \u201cmal aire\u201d, or \u201cmal hecho\u201d, or \u201cojo\u201d, all these witch -craft things.\u2019 Jes\u00fas \nTankamash was one interviewee who explained his views in  greater detail, making \nreference to the general presupposition that shamans\u2019 role is in the healing of \u2018maldad\u2019, or \nsorcery, rather than illnesses with a naturalistic aetiology:  \nWhen I was young, I drank [ayahuasca] with my late father. He was a good \u2018cur andero\u2019. His \nhealings were holy remedies. He said that one should believe, because \u2018maldades\u2019 do exist; \nin other words, \u2018maldad\u2019 of people, or \u2018maldad de la calle\u2019.  \n\u2013 \u2018Maldad de la calle\u2019, you said?  \n\u2013 \u2018Maldad de la calle\u2019; in other words, when people do sorcery (\u2018brujer\u00eda\u2019). It means when \none person passes the \u2018mal\u2019 to another person. But I don\u2019t know how that could be. I cannot \nbelieve it.  \nFor his part, Gilbert Tsakimp, the young \u2018artisan\u2019 miner, suggested, \u2018I would say that ten \npercent of young people n ow believe in shamanism.\u2019 As related in Chapter 3, just two of \nthe twelve waged miners interviewed said that they would consult a shaman in times of \nillness (five of seventeen when including \u2018artisan\u2019 miners).  \nSome anthropologists and social scientists ma y find this general consensus among \ninterviewees in the Quimi River Valley reassuring. As Richard Rorty put it paradigmatically, \n\u2018Western liberal intellectuals should accept the fact that [\u2026] there are lots of views which \nwe simply cannot take seriously\u2019 ( 1991: 29). Yet while shamanism as a practice is typically \nnot taken seriously, its undeniable existence as a social phenomenon has established it as \na central problem to be explained away in the description and analysis of non -western \nsocieties. Thus we ha ve early ethnographers\u2019 characterisations of shamans as \u2018at once \ndupe and cheat\u2019 (Taussig, 2006: 221); L\u00e9vi -Strauss\u2019s contention that a certain healer \u2018did 216 \n not become a great shaman because he cured his patients; he cured his patients because \nhe had become  a great shaman\u2019 (1963: 180); Descola\u2019s portrayal of healing visions as the \nproduct of shamanic professional conditioning (1996: 334); Taussig\u2019s attribution of \nshamanism to \u2018the power of colonial differentiation such that magic became a gathering \npoint for  Otherness in a series of racial and class differentiations\u2019 (1987: 465); and currently \nfashionable explanations oriented around placebo - and mood -triggered responses to \nshamanic performance and \u2018narrative\u2019 effect (Miller van Blerkom, 1995; Taylor, 2003).  \nHowever, the \u2018problem\u2019 could easily be put differently. At least in speaking of ayahuasca \nshamanism in western Amazonia, there is significant coherence between practitioners in \nterms of both what they say they do and how they say they do it: specifically,  that under \nthe effects of ayahuasca, they are able to \u2018see\u2019 the illness and the part of the patient\u2019s body \naffected, and from there seek to remove it (Beyer, 2009: 178; Brown, 1985: 62; Descola, \n1996: 236; Gow, 2001: 135, 139; Illius, 1992: 65, 68 -69; Lan gdon, 1992: 51; Reichel -Dolmatoff, \n1975: 94; Rubenstein, 2002: 163).55 Some may find ways to discount the relevance of this \nsignificant internal epistemological coherence, which spans indigenous and \u2018mestizo\u2019 \nAmazonian populations across three countries. Ye t even so, it would seem reasonable to \nconclude that shamans\u2019 ingestion of ayahuasca may result in a combination of acute \nsensitivity to environment and synaesthetic perception \u2013both effects noted in clinical \nresearch on other hallucinogens (Johnson, Richar ds & Griffiths, 2008: 610 -611; and Addy \net. al., 2015: 429; and Carhart -Harris et. al, 2011: 1564, respectively) \u2013such that the myriad of \nintuitions and observations made by a shaman about a patient may crystallise for the \n                                                        \n55 Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kelly describes a similar notion among Yanomami that shamans \u2018see\u2019 their patient\u2019s illness \n(2011: 1 53), an ability which appears to be tied to the consumption of the native hallucinogen \u2018yopo\u2019 (2011: \n143).  217 \n former in the form of an overlaid visual impression of the latter. Moreover, through \napprenticeship and experience these impressions, including the coloured shapes and \nobjects perceived by shamans as located within their patients\u2019 bodies (as detailed in \nChapter 4), may well be correlated w ith maladies and their respective remedies with \nreasonable success.  \nIt seems equally true that a significant number of disingenuous Amazonians are willing to \nape the mannerisms of shamanic healers in an attempt to extort obscene quantities of \nmoney from th e desperate; at least, this was a common perception in Zamora -Chinchipe. \nIn the previous chapter, we heard how Antonio Tukupi was parted from his money in his \ndesperation to see his offspring cured. With respect to shamanic apprenticeships, Franklin \nKayap of Yanua told me, \u2018There are many who do this just to study how the other man \ndoes it, then they copy him and steal money.\u2019 He attributed this to the trials of a true \nshamanic apprenticeship, which at least according to Franklin could be expected to last \n\u2018six to twelve years.\u2019 That said, the possibility in itself of perpetrating such a swindle points \nto the persistent social perception of the potential value of Amazonian shamanic cures, \neven amidst of plethora of options including clinical medicine and herb alism. It should not \nbe so hard, then, for social researchers to accept a degree of efficacy in Amazonian \nshamanic healing, and the reflexive focus on explaining away these beliefs is certainly \nunnecessary. So the question remains: why was there such conse nsus among the waged \nminers of the Quimi River Valley in their disbelief toward shamanic healing? The following \ninterviewees\u2019 accounts of successful healing interventions by Shuar shamans bear further \nwitness to the need to ask this question.  \n 218 \n First -Hand A ccounts of Shamanic Healing  \nXimena Charip  \nThe following story was recounted by Ximena Charip, a middle -aged resident of Churubia \nand wife of an \u2018artisan\u2019 miner.  \nSometimes one has tumours on the inside, in the organs: for example, cysts, stones, tumours. \nThis is why people get operations. One can also go to a shaman for these things, but the \nshamans of today cannot cure them. That\u2019s why one has to go for an operation.  \nBut then, we often distrust these people [medical personnel]. I went for treatment for a  \ncalculus on the bone and I was sent to this hospital, then this doctor, then another city, but \nthey could not do anything for me. They wanted to take the bone out, but I didn\u2019t want them \nto. I thought, \u2018It can\u2019t be right that I am fine and healthy all my life, and now this.\u2019 So perhaps \nthere is a shaman -doctor (\u2018medico -cham\u00e1n\u2019); let\u2019s try it out. Let\u2019s try everything else first.  \nSo I came back from Cuenca and started to look for a good shaman who could examine me. \nWhat happened? The shaman said that I didn \u2019t have a calculus; that it was something else, a \ndifferent disease that the shaman could cure. So I was cleansed three times [over three \nnights] and this round lump that I had disappeared, and to this day, I give thanks to God, and \nI have not been for any  more treatments. After just the second cleansing, the lump was going \ndown, and the shaman said that that meant it must have been swelling rather than a calculus. \nNow it\u2019s seven months later and I haven\u2019t had any problems. I was speaking to a friend who \nsaid that the swelling could have originated in the liver, so I\u2019m going to go to the doctor to \nrequest an ultrasound to find out.  \nAt the time, my bones, my ribs and my back were hurting and I couldn\u2019t do anything, whereas \nnow I can. I can work, go to other places to visit my friends. I couldn\u2019t do this before. I couldn\u2019t \neven stomach food. I was getting very skinny, and I\u2019d never been like that before. So that is 219 \n what I can tell you. Sometimes, because we do not believe in the shamans, we go to a doctor. \nBut if I hadn\u2019t gone to a shaman to have him examine me, what would have happened? They \nwould have operated on me, and then who knows? Perhaps I would no longer be able to live \nhere on this land [because of the demands it places on mobility].  \n\u2013 I\u2019m so happy t o hear how it worked out. What was the treatment that the shaman \nperformed on you? Was it just a cleansing, or did he give you some medication?  \n \u2013 He gave me a cup of\u2026look, I don\u2019t know, something that he prepared. There are more \nplants and vines than I c an even know about. He gave it to me to drink and told me to drink \neach day, and said that the pain would go away little by little. And believe me, we had spent \n[USD] $3,000 already. Then this, which only cost us $100, took away the pain. We were \nspending money in Cuenca, in Loja, in Gualaquiza where I was hospitalised. There was a doctor \nin Cuenca who wanted $2,000 for the operation. Then in Gualaquiza they were going to do it \nfor free, and they have excellent technical knowledge in Gualaquiza and receive it from \ndoctors in other countries. Then some doctors said it was a huge calculus and that they could \noperate on me, but I might not survive.  \nThis example conforms closely to the type of shamanic healing outlined previously. As \nXimena went on to explain:  \n\u2013 What was the shaman\u2019s name?  \n\u2013 Fernando Jimpikit. He lives near Gualaquiza.  \n\u2013 Does he drink nat\u00e9m when he is diagnosing patients?  \n\u2013 Yes. When he drank, he focused on examining just me. When they drink, everything comes \nto them. Fernando told me that I h ad been done harm (\u2018hecho da\u00f1o\u2019) by people around here \nout of pure envy. My children are studying and my daughter was queen of the parish.56 \u2018It\u2019s \n                                                        \n56 Ximena is referring to the beauty pageants held annually throughout the region in which local town \nofficials judge young girls, who are often stil l in high -school.  220 \n because you\u2019re a hard -working person and you and your husband have earned plenty of \ngoods,\u2019 he said.  \n\u2013 Did he  tell you who it was specifically?  \n\u2013 Only that it was relatives of my husband. That was all.  \nIn other words, a diagnosis made by a shaman under the influence of ayahuasca was \nfollowed by the provision of a herbal remedy, which effected a rapid cure of th e problem. \nThere is no obligation here to accept that Ximena\u2019s affliction was caused by sorcery, or the \nother common claim that shamans are able to \u2018suck\u2019 afflictions out of their patients\u2019 \nbodies. At its core, what we see here is an effective cure that av oided the prospect of \nsurgery, with all its attendant complications.  \nThe other side of the coin was also visible in Ximena\u2019s testimony, when she related a failed \nattempt to seek a cure for her son from a shaman:  \n\u2013 Had you ever gone to see a shaman before that?  \n\u2013 Yes. It was a shaman from Pastaza and he robbed us of $2,000 when my son was sick. He \ndid not even cure my son.  \n\u2013 He travelled here?  \n\u2013 Yes, he did. My son had a work accident when he was carrying heavy loads at a job near \nLoja. He had a swelling in his groin and could not urinate. They gave him medications at the \nhospital, but he just got worse and worse. So we took him out ourselves and went to visit a \nherbalist -doctor (\u2018medico -naturista\u2019) in the city of Loja. This Se\u00f1ora gave him a natural \ninfus ion she had prepared and ten minutes later he was able to urinate. The Se\u00f1ora charged \nus $6.  \n \n 221 \n Matilde Yankuam  \nMatilde is a resident of the small Shuar town of Kiim, in the \u2018cant\u00f3n\u2019  of Yacuambi, though \nmuch of her family lives in Alto Nangaritza. Kiim was constructed around a church that \nformerly had regular services, and Matilde herself was educated at a mission -school, which \nhelps explain her reluctance to consult with shamans. None theless, drastic times call for \ndrastic measures. Such was the illness suffered by her son:  \nWhen my son came to visit us when he was sick, the medications didn\u2019t make him any better \nand in fact he was getting worse. So I asked my husband, \u201cIf it is a sick ness (\u2018enfermedad\u2019) \n[as opposed to a \u2018maldad\u2019], how is it that he isn\u2019t getting better?\u201d Look, I\u2019ve never gone into \nthis, but I took my son to do this, to see a shaman (\u2018curandero\u2019). He was of our own race, a \nwitch -doctor (\u2018brujo\u2019), as they say.  \n\u2013 An uwis hin?  \n\u2013 Ahah, uwishin . So he looked at my son. He said that he used to work on the other side too, \nthe counterpart of his own race (\u2018contraparte de la raza de \u00e9l\u2019), with the Ministry [sic] of \nIndigenous Health. Now he works with natural medicines.  \nFirst he  said he had to do tests on him to be able to analyse his illness. He took my son\u2019s \ntemperature first and checked his blood pressure. He measured his weight and waistline. \nThen at night he performed a \u2018mesada\u2019  [setting up Catholic icons at a table and invo king spirits \nfor healing] and \u2018soplada\u2019 [blowing perfumed alcohol over the patient]. We said, \u2018Maybe it is \n\u201cmal viento\u201d, or \u201cmal aire\u201d\u2019. So we went out that night to collect \u2018cariamanga\u2019  [a reed -like \ngrass] and came back the same night.  \nOn the second day he seemed better, but then that afternoon he turned bad again. The \n\u2018curandero\u2019  cleaned him. He gave him only natural medicines, all the medicines that we \ncultivate as part of rescuing our culture. Up to the present day I\u2019m sorry that it was this that 222 \n cured  my son. My son was healed this way, with three cleansings (\u2018limpiezas\u2019). My son always \nrecommends this \u2018curandero\u2019  to other people now, because he didn\u2019t get better at all going \nto the clinics or taking their medications. [\u2026] He was cured in four days of treatments.  \nIt is unfortunately unclear in this case whether the shaman relied on an ayahuasca -induced \nstate to diagnose the patient, although it seems quite likely that this was part of his \npractice, given the wariness toward him felt by Matilde and revea led in her use of the term \n\u2018brujo\u2019. There is a curious opposition here in Matilde\u2019s praise of the shaman\u2019s administering \nof natural medicine (\u2018the medicines that we cultivate as part of rescuing our culture\u2019) and \nher religiously inspired suspicion of the s haman himself and his methods. Nonetheless, it \nis clear that whatever his method, the shaman was able to accurately diagnose and resolve \na health concern that was not being treated satisfactorily at local medical clinics.  \n \nAlma Tunki   \nLastly, Alma Tunki,  originally of Morona -Santiago but residing in Shaime at the time of the \npresent study, recounts an ordeal that finally ended with her liver -stones being properly \ntreated by a Shuar shaman. Estimating her age, the events must have occurred some 45 \nyears ag o.  \nI was 18 years old when I started to get sick. They could not cure me \u2013nothing, nothing. And \nthe nuns said to me \u2013I was at a mission \u2013they said, \u2018Go and have an operation in Quito.\u2019 Well I \nobliged them and did that. In those days, Ecuador had not \u2018dollari zed.\u2019 I went with my husband \nto Quito and I saw the nuns. I was in a \u2018tr\u00e1mite\u2019 [making some sort of application to be treated] \nfrom Monday until Friday, and then the following Monday, again, for the blood and urine \ntests.  223 \n On the Sunday, I saw the nuns and they said, \u2018Are you visiting?\u2019 And I answered, \u2018Coming from \na poor family, how could I just be travelling all the way here? It\u2019s because of my health.\u2019  \nAnd they said, \u2018What is wrong?\u2019 And I said, \u2018I have a problem with my liver. I have suffered \nfrom it fo r years.\u2019  \n\u2018And what did the doctors tell you? To get an operation? You\u2019ll have to do the \u201ctr\u00e1mite\u201d,\u2019 like \nI was saying. \u2018You need an operation on your liver. You have liver -stones.\u2019  \nThen the nun said to me \u2013she was a foreigner, like yourself, she was Italia n\u2013and she said, \n\u2018They\u2019re going to cut your body. Leave behind those natural remedies from your \u201cOriente\u201d  \n[Amazon] and have them cut your body.\u2019  \nThe next day, she told me to go back and said, \u2018I\u2019ll take you to the bus station myself. You will \nget an operati on. Take this money so that you can go by plane\u2026You can have the tests done \nin Puyo.\u2019 And in Puyo it was the same. They said, \u2018You have to go to Ambato.\u2019 If I go there, I \nthought, then I\u2019ll be sent somewhere else, still with the same pain. So I went to Mac as [in \nMorona -Santiago] and from there back to my house.  \nBut I was still feeling the same pain. My liver was swollen. A witch -doctor (\u2018brujo\u2019)  arrived and \nthey called him. I was lying there, hanging in a hammock. The \u2018brujo\u2019 looked at me \u2013he was \nfrom Cayam\u00e1 s\u2013and said, \u2018Take her up to my house so that I can treat her there. Bring a chook \nand \u201caceite de arbolito\u201d  [an unspecific plant oil], and I will prepare her my own homemade \nremedies.\u2019 And that is what he did.  \nOne night there, he drank nat\u00e9m  and he blew (\u2018 soplar\u2019) using cedar bark. Then the next \nnight, he gave me chicha to drink. Then another night, the last one, he gave me chicha. He \nalso gave me the oil that he had blown over, and he told me to drink chicken broth early the \nnext morning. Then the next day  my body started to eject these captains, these bosses [sic], \nthe stones, the rubbish from my body, which had already been formed from the evil (\u2018mal\u2019). \n\u2013 Were you vomiting these up?  224 \n \u2013 No\u2026out the back. I didn\u2019t vomit. It was after I drank the oil and the broth. The captain \ncame out and then the small ones, little green things. I went to see him and said, \u2018It was \nthese things. These were the \u201cmal\u201d  that was killing me.\u2019  \n\u2018Very good,\u2019 he said.  \nThe nuns had told me to leave natural remedies and come and be cut  open. And then it was \njust cost after cost after cost. But after this, my stomach was flat, like there was nothing \ninside. I felt very well.  \n\u2013 Did you eat anything during this time, or was it just nat\u00e9m and chicha that you drank?  \n\u2013 I didn\u2019t drink nat\u00e9m . Just chicha, chicken broth and the oil. That was how I was cured.  \nThe pattern of an ayahuasca -provoked diagnosis and herbal remedy is by now familiar. The \ntwist in this version of the tale is the extreme neglect visited upon a young, poor \nindigenous woman  in 1970s Ecuador, for whom there was evidently no \u2018right\u2019 to adequate \nhealthcare and for whom Shuar ancestral healing practices were her only possible \nrecourse.  \n \nThe Mechanics of Disbelief in the Quimi River Valley  \nFor Shuar miners living along the Quimi  River, then, shamanic healing is not just an \nancestral practice and belief but also a social phenomenon the faith in which is reasonably \nbuttressed by tangible, contemporary accounts of resolution of otherwise intractable \nhealth problems. In this case, ho w is it exactly that they disbelieve in and are willing to \ndismiss shamanic healing? The fact that certain shamans have failed to cure in certain \nsituations is not explanation enough, for even the most resolutely involved in accessing \nshamanic healing and rejecting clinical medicine recognise that most shamans are 225 \n incapable of healing every patient they examine, due to the notion that in order to heal \n\u2018maldad\u2019, the curing shaman must be more powerful than the sorcerer who originated it.  \nAs in the case of v ision -seeking practices in Alto Nangaritza, the responses of the more \neffusive interviewees pointed to a greater degree of complexity, which lingered beneath \nthe surface of the misleadingly straightforward dismissals on the part of interviewees who \nclaimed  to \u2018not believe in\u2019 shamans. Gilbert Tsakimp\u2019s interview was a case in point:  \nYes, but around here in Zamora, they say that the majority of the shamans who make  nat\u00e9m  \ndon\u2019t actually know. But then in Morona -Santiago and in Pastaza, where the \u2018cofanes\u2019 and the \n\u2018huaoranis\u201957 live, among them, and I\u2019ve heard that the best shamans are from the \u2018cofanes\u2019 \nand the Kichwas, and they can do things that will leave you stunned. Th ey are professionals.  \nThis is clearly not, as Gilbert\u2019s testimony initially reads, an unequivocal rejection of the \ncapacity of shamans in general to heal, but rather appears to be a more focused critique \nof the state of knowledge of shamanism amongst Shuar  people in Zamora -Chinchipe. \u2018We \nsee how people fall into the trap, listening to lies, paying too much money,\u2019 said Gilbert. \u2018If \nthere were true shamans here, we would know them.\u2019 His belief could be described as \nambivalent: dismissing pretender shamans in  his vicinity while remaining open to the \npossibility of shamanic healing existing elsewhere. Shuar people throughout Zamora -\nChinchipe mostly had complex opinions on other Amazonian people living further into the \nforest, whom they tended to view with an ad miration tinged with melancholy resignation \nthat they would never return to such a state. Achuar and Huaorani were often described \nas \u2018savage\u2019 and \u2018stronger\u2019 than themselves, the \u2018civilized\u2019 Ecuadorian Shuar. Mateo \nYankuam of Kiim described his fellow Zamo ra-Chinchipe Shuar as \u2018like butter\u2019 in \n                                                        \n57 The Cof\u00e1n and Huaorani are indigenous Amazonian peoples.  226 \n comparison with the \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018resistant\u2019 nature of the Peruvian Shuar and Aguaruna, \nwho live in more remote jungle.  \nGilbert\u2019s sentiment of seemingly suspended disbelief regarding shamanic healing was \nmirrored by Luc io and Mateo Tsakimp when they said, \u2018There is nothing of that here \nanymore,\u2019 with respect to what they would consider true shamans \u2018who know how to \ncure.\u2019 Their counterpoint was not a distant Amazonian group but in fact their own \ngrandfather, who they sai d \u2018was very good at healing,\u2019 who \u2018could convert himself into a \ntiger [jaguar], or a boa,\u2019 and who \u2018could even call the peccaries, so they wouldn\u2019t stay a \nlong way away.\u2019 As we saw earlier, too, Jes\u00fas Tankamash said that he could not believe in \nshamanism, but nonetheless considered that his father\u2019s treatments were \u2018holy remedies.\u2019 \nThis suggests that time and distance serve twenty -first century Shuar people in Zamora -\nChinchipe analogously in setting themselves apart from ideal expressions of \u2018Indian -ness,\u2019 \nwhich is itself a sign that broader Latin American discourses related to progress and \nethnicity are finding leverage among Shuar people. This merging of temporal and spatial \ndistance, according to Hale, \u2018creat[ed] a powerful composite image of the racializ ed Other\u2019 \nwhich was fundamental to Latin republics\u2019 narratives of progress through mestizaje (2004: \n17). In both cases, what we see is an example of what Michael Taussig called the \n\u2018imputations of magic in Otherness\u2019, for \u2018wherever you go, the great \u201cbrujo s\u201d are \nelsewhere\u2019 (1987: 179): elsewhere, we might add, in time or in space.  \nFor Taussig, it was this \u2018magic in Otherness\u2019 on which shamanism was dependent. Yet in \nstudying shamanism in the context of interethnic relations in the Andes -Amazonian region, \nTaussig had already flown the coop, as it were, in terms of the relevance of his argument \nto contexts where shamanism exists as an endogenous social phenomenon and 227 \n knowledge practice. It is indeed true that in many cases shamans\u2019 reputations are \nenhanced by  association with the exotic: whether in the form of the Orientalist fantasies \nof ayahuasca tourists (Ainsworth, 2014: 35 -36) or the ideals of Indian -ness in mestizo \nsociety, in one direction; or the invocations of biomedical symbolism (Greene, 1998: 650) \nor of aeroplanes and other military machinery (Descola, 1996: 343 -344; Illius, 1992: 73) \nemployed by shamans to impress their indigenous Amazonian clientele.58 Yet underlying \nthis, there remains an elegance to the treatment practice of shamans who examine t heir \npatients and reach their diagnosis under the influence of ayahuasca and prescribe \nmedicinal plant remedies on that basis. The ongoing practice of such a mode of shamanic \nhealing in wholly Shuar contexts, without the need for drawing upon performative \ngestures and a symbolic repertoire, belies  the notion that ayahuasca shamanism is \ndependent on the complex of interethnic social relations in which it is often located. In \nfact, as an explanatory gesture, the fine -grained ethnographic detailing of the symb olic \nrelations in which shamanism as a \u2018situated\u2019 knowledge is sometimes embedded may \nfunction to discount its relevance as a knowledge practice capable of being employed \nacross various contexts.  \nFor Shuar miners, perhaps it is this explaining away (by loc ating it at a temporal, geographic \nor cultural distance) of shamanism, and the subsequent conceptualisation of shamanic \npractices as something magical and therefore impossible for oneself to practise, that is the \nvery nature of disbelief when faced with th e persistent social reality of practices whose \nontological validity is contested. In other words, when the existence of proximate \n                                                        \n58 As Janet Hendricks argued following fieldwork in Shuar communities in Morona -Santiago, \u2018the [Shuar] \nnotion of power includes the belief that foreign sources of power are more p otent than Shuar sources\u2019 \n(1988: 219).  228 \n \u2018magical\u2019 practices cannot be denied \u2013whether it be located in the recent past of the Quimi \nRiver Valley, the ethno -cultural di fference of Cof\u00e1n people, or the geographical distance \nof Alto Nangaritza \u2013it is the attribution of feasibility or believability as dependent on that \ndistance which constitutes the act of disbelieving, a sort of ontological expansionism that \nserves to const ruct a frontier of plausibility and situate the practice in question on the \nother side. The millennial generation of Quimi Valley Shuar residents sit on the edge of this \nfrontier, from which medical scientists, public policy analysts and other adherents of  the \nnature/culture dichotomy with \u2018proper\u2019 alternative explanations of shamanic healing are \nwell insulated. The global discourse on indigenous rights and ideals of indigeneity appears \nto be playing a functional role in this transformation of beliefs aroun d healing among Shuar \npeople in the waged economy, in the way it is set against the ideal of economic progress \nwith which Shuar miners have come to identify. Ironically, in explaining shamanism as \nprimarily operative at the level of symbols, metaphors and performance, anthropologists \nhave contributed to constructing the \u2018cultural\u2019 variant of this procedure of disbelief -via-\ndistancing which is now being internalised by some Shuar people as they adopt a modern \nsubjectivity.  \n \nDistancing Oneself from Vision   \nThe perception of the validity of plant -induced visions among miners in the Quimi River \nValley was similar to their perception of shamanic healing. There was little offered by way \nof rationalising their disbelief; instead, disbelief functioned by situating  the relevance of \nvisionary practices elsewhere, particularly in the bygone era of past generations. As Jes\u00fas \nTankamash put it:  229 \n My grandparents have lived here and sown many natural products. Our grandparents were \nalso shamans. However today, excuse me wh en I say this, but I don\u2019t believe. The power from \nthose times was very different. Think about \u2018guantu\u2019 [datura], for example. They drank this so \nthat they could attain power. This is a powerful remedy. On the other hand, I am Catholic and \nvery religious. I believe in God, and this God is much more powerful than any man. For this \nreason, I do not believe in witchcraft (\u2018brujer\u00edas\u2019) or that shamans can cure. Our God is the \nbest doctor. He is the only powerful one who can harm, construct and unmake and end \neverything.  \nNow my grandparents were also believers in God, but in a different sense. For example, \nthere is also nat\u00e9m . This was the power of God and through this, they saw God. In that way, \nthey received power and the Holy Spirit and they believed themselve s to be powerful and \nbrave. They were stronger than we are today. Today we young people have a lower energy \nand strength. We don\u2019t have visions because we have forgotten the customs of my fathers. \nToday we don\u2019t use these things. Instead, if I have cancer or sore bones, where do I go? To \nthe hospital, the clinic. They apply a serum and remedies that are simply drugs, these \nproducts that we receive from them. \u2018You are simply numbing me,\u2019 I have often thought.  \n\u2013 In that case, why go to the clinic?  \n\u2013 Why? Bec ause we have neglected this practice [that of their grandparents]. At times, we \nfeel lazy towards this. With \u2018guantu\u2019 [datura], the spirit of this is very strong. One has to fast \nfor three days.  \nIn one sense, this testimony parallels the beliefs and percep tions of Evangelical Shuar \nregarding the validity of hallucinogenic visions. There is an open recognition that ancestral \nbeliefs worked for the ancestors and had positive effects, yet the interviewee still feels the \nneed to distance himself from them. One might speculate that where Evangelicals are \nseduced by the notion of God, as is the \u2018very religious\u2019 Jes\u00fas, miners are seduced by the 230 \n notion of progress, in the sense of struggling to reconcile the enjoyment of both ancestral \npractices of spirituality and the fruits of material and technological advance.  \nAn apparently similar dynamic is at work in the thinking of the aforementioned Lucio and \nMateo Tsakimp, two brothers who reside in Churubia and are employed at the Mirador \nmine. When asked about their exper iences with datura ( maikiua ), they spoke in ostensibly \nglowing terms, before surprisingly concluding with the affirmation, \u2018We no longer apply \nthis culture\u2019 (\u2018Esta cultura ya no aplicamos\u2019):  \nLT \u2013 I drank it once when I was very sick.  \nQ \u2013 What was wrong?  \nLT \u2013 I fell from a tree, from very high. I had climbed high, two or three branches high at least, \nand I fell. I was 8 years old. It was 4 o\u2019clock when I fell, but I did not wake up until 8pm that \nnight. My mother prepared \u2018guantu\u2019 and gave it to me the ne xt day. I was cured with this.  \nQ \u2013 So you applied it to yourself?  \nLT \u2013 Yes, all over, all over.  \nQ \u2013 And you drank it as well?  \nLT \u2013 Yes, I drank it. It cured me, it cured me. One becomes drunk and then sees how one is \nbeing cured. People come to speak to  you. \u2018Guantu\u2019 is the doctor who comes to speak with \nyou. It tells the person how they are going to be, how they will be cured. It is like a doctor. It \nspeaks to you through the vision.  \nQ \u2013 So you are completely unconscious for a long time after drinking this?  \nLT \u2013 Of course: some two or three days unconscious. The drunkenness doesn\u2019t just pass.  \nQ \u2013 How do you experience this? Is it like sleeping?  \nLT \u2013 Yes, it leaves you sleeping [\u2018te deja durmiendo\u2019]. But inside, you know everything that \nyou are seeing.  The images come to you like on a television. Then eventually they leave and \nit passes.  231 \n Q \u2013 Are you aware of your body though?  \nLT \u2013 It\u2019s like you are sleeping. You\u2019re sleeping, but you are seeing what is happening. For \nexample, how can I explain it: it\u2019s like you are under anaesthesia. On the screen, you are \nseeing how the doctors are operating on you. However you don\u2019t feel any pain.  \nQ \u2013 Have you drunk it yourself, Mateo?  \nMT \u2013 I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve only drunk nat\u00e9m .  \nQ \u2013 So you see the doctor there?  \nLT \u2013 Yes, like a person talking to you.  A doctor comes before you.  \nMT \u2013 A person comes to talk to you, a doctor, dressed in white. S/he speaks to you [no \npronoun in original]. Sometimes s/he speaks in our language as well, the Shuar language. \nS/he tells you that  s/he\u2019s giving you power, that you are like this, that s/he\u2019s making you like \nthis, that you are not going to die, and how it\u2019s going to be, that\u2019s how s/he speaks to you.  \nQ \u2013 And this is the plant itself?  \nMT \u2013 The plant itself.  \nLT \u2013 The plant itself. T hat\u2019s how it happened to me. The power, the strength, is in that plant.  \nQ \u2013 So given that you\u2019ve had this experience, do you then give nat\u00e9m  and maikiua  to your \nown children?  \nMT \u2013 No, no. We do not apply this culture anymore.  \nLT \u2013 If we speak of nat\u00e9m , it tastes very bitter, terrible. And one can have bad experiences, \nseeing the things that are going to happen to you. [\u2026]  \nMT \u2013 When I drank nat\u00e9m  with my grandfather, I just wanted to see sex and tonnes of girls. \nBut after drinking it, I regretted it.  Sna kes everywhere! I am never going to drink it again, I \nthought. I told my grandfather afterwards, \u2018I can\u2019t stand seeing all these things again.\u2019 I also \nsaw lots of people watching over me. Wherever I turned, they were there. I couldn\u2019t stand \nit. So I ran ou t of my grandfather\u2019s house. I couldn\u2019t stand it. I started walking home, but I \nended up sleeping outside. It was such a dark night that I slept among the coffee trees. In 232 \n the forest, there are so many mosquitos, and every mosquito was talking to me. That\u2019 s how \nit was.  \nQ \u2013 Sounds tough. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re not giving it to the next generation?  \nMT \u2013 Drinking it again was a frightening idea. I don\u2019t want to drink it again.  \nLT \u2013 Look, it\u2019s not the same epoch now. Before, yes, it was very different.  \nSo again,  we see this dynamic where the interviewees distance themselves from a practice \n(the maikiua  healing) that they ostensibly see as praiseworthy. In no sense are they \ndenying that the plant is curative, or even that one directly engages with the spirit of th e \nplant while being healed. Yet still they turn away from the practice, which they revealingly \nrefer to as \u2018culture\u2019 and consider to be no longer theirs. In these cases, the mechanics of \ndisbelief parallel Isabelle Stengers\u2019s description of modern subjecti vity as a stance of \n\u2018tolerance\u2019 which is \u2018instantly applied as soon as we hear, understand and accept that \u201cwe\u201d \nare not like the others, those we define in terms of beliefs that we are proud, but possibly \nalso pained, to no longer share\u2019 (2011: 303). This modern subjectivity adopted by Shuar \nminers illustrates on a micro -scale the way in which modernity authorises knowledge \npractices and marginalises others through application of the moniker of \u2018culture.\u2019 Within \nthis subjectivity, waged miners lose the sens e that it is possible and desirable to combine \nthe knowledge practices that constitute their cultural inheritance with everyday economic \nactivity defined by technological and economic rationalism. There is, moreover, an evident \ncomplementarity between the marginalisation of \u2018culture\u2019 in modern subjectivity and \nexaggerated ideals of indigeneity, which together serve to dissociate contemporary, Shuar \npeople from ancestral knowledge and practice.  \nAs for their rejection of nat\u00e9m , Lucio and Mateo Tsakimp explain  their position to some \nextent with reference to the brew\u2019s acrid taste and its propensity to induce frightening 233 \n visions. Yet these characteristics are a constant, even in regions where it is consumed \nenthusiastically. One could argue that Mateo\u2019s complain ts about his experience are \nindicative of the separation of the brew from the socio -environmental context of \nindependent Jivaroan peoples, in which a life lived constantly embroiled in the minor \ndiscomforts of the rainforest and surrounded by potentially h ostile neighbours, including \nanimals, spirits and humans, fostered a culture in which ideals of a masculine selfhood \ndefined by fearlessness and resistance to hardship were granted a central place (see \nTaylor, 2014: 97). Having the willpower to confront te rrifying visions was the mark of the \nman and spoke of the capacity to remain steadfast when confronted with the very real \ndangers of the waking world.59 In such cultures, it would be seen as disgraceful and a sign \nof weakness and vulnerability to complain a bout the discomforts of and frightening visions \nprovoked by nat\u00e9m (Descola, 1996: 302 -3), as Mateo does, and even more disappointing \nto deny that education to one\u2019s offspring (Harner, 1972: 91). By contrast, once survival \nbecomes primarily dependent on sho wing up for work, as it is for Mateo, Lucio and the \nother waged miners, such socialisation practices lose their original impetus.  \nYet there is a sense here that in striving to compose a post factum  environmental \ndeterminist explanation for the rejection o f ayahuasca in a modern economic context, it is \nmerely the accoutrements of the practice  being discussed, rather than the practice itself. \nAlto Nangaritza serves as an illustrative point of contrast. While success in hunting and in \nagriculture is still a product of willpower in the face of constant physical challenges, as it \nhas been for Shuar people for centuries, endemic feuding has disappeared, to the extent \nthat the implication between vision -seeking practices and the capacity to face mortal \n                                                        \n59 Among the indigenous Siona people in the Amazon of the Ecuadorian -Colombian border region, \nayahuasca is also said to both require and breed strength in those who consume it (Langdon, 1992: 56).  234 \n threats ha s lost its historic relevance. Yet absent the alternate subjectivity produced by \nEvangelical religion or the discourse and subjectivity of modernity and material progress \nstimulated by participation in the waged economy, Shuar people in Alto Nangaritza \nseemed much more resistant to disowning their heritage as indigenous people. \nConsequently, they continued to pursue rites based around the ingestion of hallucinogenic \nplants, and in so doing were able to progressively reconceptualise the relevance of the \nprac tice for the twenty -first century. As we saw in Chapter 4, vision -seeking had been \nadapted away from a discourse of warfare towards notions of self -development and \nempowerment capable of incorporating contemporary experiences such as vocational \neducation a nd political mobilisation. The comparison between the Quimi River Valley and \nAlto Nangaritza, therefore, demonstrates the interdependency of discourses and their \nattendant subjectivities if they are to transform health -seeking behaviour and their \nattendant  ontologies. Turning to consider the use of medicinal plants, however, is more \nsuggestive of the compulsive impacts of structural economic factors on the changing \nrelationship to the use of medicine in everyday life, and on inherited culture broadly \nspeaki ng. \n \nLand, Plant Knowledge and the Predicament of Young Waged Labourers  \nAs was noted in Chapter 3, clinical medicine was the foremost option in case of illness for \nhouseholds in the waged mining economy, though there were exceptions. Franklin Kayap, \na Yanu a resident who works at the Mirador mine and was consequently subject to the \nsevere hostility of some others in the community, in fact had an extensive knowledge of \nmedicinal plants and claimed to have some two dozen types cultivated. Churubia residents 235 \n Jasper Tankamash and Zoila Kantuash reported using botanical remedies for treating \ncolds, flu, coughing, fever, diarrhoea, sore throats and swollen glands, stomachaches, \nparasites, cuts, breaks and sprains. They were also the exception in insisting on shaman ic \ntreatment in the case of \u2018maldad\u2019, employing an interpretive framework familiar from Alto \nNangaritza. As Zoila put it, \u2018When it\u2019s not a disease that, let\u2019s say, God himself put there, \nthen these remedies have no effect. [\u2026] You need to see a witch -docto r (\u201cbrujo\u201d). The \n\u201cmaldad\u201d consumes the person quickly; it\u2019s not like a sickness (\u201cenfermedad\u201d).\u2019 Despite \nthe common disavowals of their relevance, the minority presence of these practices in the \nQuimi River Valley suggests that they were widespread in the province of Zamora -\nChinchipe until relatively recently.  \nWhat was surprising about the extent of usage of medicinal plants by waged miners was \nnot simply the general level of disinterest evident in their accounts, but also the fact that \nthey considered thei r preference for clinical medicine to be so obvious that it required little \nexplanation. As Mateo Tsakimp said (cited previously in Chapter 3), \u2018 Of course , when it \ncomes to sickness, I\u2019m affiliated to social security and when my children are ill, I take th em \nfor medical attention\u2019 [my emphasis]. Miners typically saw their lack of knowledge about \nmedicinal plants as perhaps lamentable, but also as an unremarkable fact of life. An\u00edbal \nTseremp, for example, who like many assumed that I was hoping for a detaile d description \nof the medicinal plants in the area, related:  \nI could not explain much about this to you. My grandparents knew about it, but they\u2019re gone. \nSo I\u2019m not very well informed on this. Yes, there are medicinal plants, for a snakebite, for \nexample. Now we do not apply this, because we have medicines and hospitals. That is why I \ndon\u2019t have much knowledge about it.  236 \n Others were less outspoken but conveyed the same message. Facundo Kayuk, a Yanua \nresident and father of two in his late twenties, reported that \u2018we always go to the clinic, or \nthe hospital. When it comes to natural medicine, we pretty much don\u2019t know anything \nabout it.\u2019 He also said that his wife \u2018of course\u2019 gave birth in hospital, rather than in their \nhome. Similarly, Norma Tsakimp claimed t hat \u2018when it comes to finding medicines in the \ncountryside (\u201ccampo\u201d), we don\u2019t have much chance to do so.\u2019  \nThis testimony was expressed in an area with very similar biophysical characteristics to the \nNangaritza River Basin, with large areas of forest serv ing as a habitat for wild animals and \nwhere other interviewees reported making use of dozens of different medicinal plants. As \nsuch, the indifference toward medicinal plants is suggestive of two broader phenomena. \nOne is that these households tended to hav e become accustomed to satisfying their needs \nthrough the cash economy. With the exception of two homes presided over by elderly \nwomen, which were permeated by the sour smell of fermenting batches of chicha which \nwas so familiar in Nangaritza, all of the k itchens I saw in the Quimi River Valley were \nprovisioned with store -bought goods. Indeed, it was a frequent complaint of the men I \nspoke with, when the conversation touched on \u2018traditional ways,\u2019 that their wives no \nlonger prepared chicha (the men consider ed it beneath their dignity to do so \nthemselves).60 Although clinical medical attention is provided free of charge in Ecuador \nand as such is not an economic product per se, the subjectivity created by a wage economy \nin which men leave the home to work for a  wage and women remain at home in the private \nsphere \u2013and very much idle in comparison with Shuar women in the subsistence economy \u2013\nwould seem to lend itself to an increasingly clientelistic engagement with healthcare \n                                                        \n60 My own attempt to h elp in preparing chicha during my first fortnight in Nangaritza seemed to have been \nthe funniest thing anyone had seen in weeks.  237 \n needs. Indeed, it was remarked upon by t wo of the waged miners interviewed as a positive \naspect of clinical medicine that it is \u2018free\u2019, while the same was never said about the region\u2019s \nnative medicinal plants.  \nThe second broader phenomena made manifest in this indifference toward and absence \nof knowledge about medicinal plants is that for many of the miners in the valley, \nparticipation in the wage economy was itself a result of the historic experience of \ndispossession and dislocation. The aforementioned Norma Tsakimp, who was able to live \nin Chu rubia with her Shuar husband thanks to her own ancestry, had previously lived in the \nfar north of the Ecuadorian Amazon, where her husband was working in the oil industry in \nthe province of Sucumb\u00edos. They subsequently moved back to a Shuar \u2018centro\u2019 on the  \nurban periphery in Morona -Santiago, where her husband was raised, before he accepted \na job at the Mirador mine and the two of them moved to Churubia. This personal history \nhighlights the flaw in assuming a high degree of medicinal plant knowledge among \n\u2018indigenous peoples\u2019 and, on a more general level, their exteriority to modern discourses, \nsubjectivities and economic forces. While it is true that Shuar culture is often generative of \na high degree of knowledge about what we would call the \u2018natural\u2019 world \u2013its elements \nand their potential relations with humans and one another \u2013this cultural inheritance is not \nnecessarily the dominant cultural vector for the current generation of young Shuar \nparents. In the communities along the Quimi River, the lives of these  particular Shuar \npeople are shaped to a greater extent by their obligations with respect to their position \nrelative to capital, as well as the scarcity of land, itself brought about by a number of \nfactors, predominately dispossession at the hands of colon ists, but also the elimination of \nendemic feuding and the prohibition and subsequent loss of knowledge about \ncontraception resulting from missionary activity. For Norma, after having spent many 238 \n years in the wage economy in the city, it is not surprising th at the healing practices and \nnative medicinal flora that are indigenous to Shuar traditionally occupied territory hold \nlittle personal importance. While her right to occupy indigenous land was passed to her \nhereditarily, the transmission of culture is far more complex.  \nThe fundamental importance of structural economic factors in shaping health -seeking \nbehaviours is manifest in the testimony of Facundo Kayuk of Yanua. Another waged miner \nwho dismissed the relevance of traditional medicine, Facundo was at th e same time \nexplicitly critical of the presence of the mine in the valley. His engagement with the mining \neconomy \u2013and the subsequent building of a life that revolved around soccer, television and \npurchased goods \u2013was a response to the necessities of his con text, rather than a rejection \nof ancestral practices in and of themselves. In Facundo\u2019s words:  \n\u2013 I work with ECSA [Ecuacorriente, the mine operator].  \n\u2013 It must be difficult, when your father is so against the mine.  \n\u2013 How do I put this \u2026 none of us like it . In one regard, mining is good, in another regard it is \nbad. It produces pollution. It pollutes the water that we drink and bathe in. One day it won\u2019t \nbe like it is today. Sure, they say they are building tailings ponds, but what can they do with \nso much material that needs to be washed? The rivers are going to be contaminated. Then \nthe animals will die and the plants will die. They can do rescue and reforestation, but not for \nall the living things there.  \nThe unspoken element to this critique \u2013the \u2018in one r egard\u2019 \u2013is that Facundo has no other \noptions for providing for his family.  Many in his position would find themselves seeking \nemployment in one of the country\u2019s major cities; indeed, analysis of indigenous \n\u2018proletarianisation\u2019 has often assumed the disposse ssion of traditionally occupied territory \nfollowed as a consequence by indigenous urban in -migration (e.g. Hartwig G., 1978: 89 \u2013239 \n 90). For Facundo, the absence of any prospect of controlling his own land has forced his \ndecision to tie his fate to his economi c success, while all but disregarding the relevance of \nknowledge of his biophysical environment, including medicinal plants. A similar \nsubjectivity seemed apparent with another young father, Asad Tsakimp. A resident of \nChurubia and \u2018artisan\u2019 miner, Asad re plied to my questioning about healing practices by \nsaying, \u2018But traditional medicine, what can I tell you about that? I don\u2019t really know. I just \nknow that if I don\u2019t work I don\u2019t eat, so I have to do everything to get ahead for my family.\u2019 \nIn short, what is evident in the Quimi River Valley is an indigenous working -class: neither \nentirely displaced urban proletariat, nor owner -occupiers of significant tracts of territory.  \nWhile an unromantic portrait of a piece of indigenous Amazonia, there was nothing \nobviously distressing about this situation to Facundo and Asad themselves. Certainly \nFacundo was concerned about the possibility of water contamination from the Mirador \nmine; Asad, by contrast, rarely mentioned the mine during the several months we \nremained friends. At the time of fieldwork, the two were living rent -free and debt -free with \nyoung families, accessed free government social services and owned their own homes, \nwell -stocked kitchens and plenty of toys: Facundo owned a DVD player and a television \nwith a satellite connection, while Asad owned a keyboard and sound -system and played \ncumbia at local parties.61 Asad was also the only person I met in Ecuador who, upon hearing \nmy response to the ubiquitous question of how much it would cost to fly to Austral ia, \nreplied, \u2018That\u2019s not that much,\u2019 an indication of the degree of economic possibility afforded \n                                                        \n61 This seems to be the appropriate point to mention that I was offered exorbitant sums for my research \nequipment \u2013my voice reco rder and camera \u2013during my time in the Quimi River Valley.  240 \n by \u2018artisan\u2019 mining. This socio -economic reality mirrors the small -scale indigenous mining \neconomy of gold and diamonds in Venezuela. As Luis Angosto -Ferr\u00e1nde z comments:  \n[M]any indigenous peoples and communities across the world are actively seeking strategies \nto incorporate themselves into capitalism from positions of relative advantage that \nsometimes stem from claims to indigenous rights. [\u2026] If no -return pro letarianisation and/or \nforced dispossession can be stopped in this way, what is the objection to those processes, \ngiven the apparent lack of alternatives? In any event, in addition to contradicting the \nconventional wisdom that associates indigeneity with a nti-capitalism, the existence of this \nreality obviously demands caution in the analysis of political processes (2015: 232).62 \nAgain, one might well lament the desirability for humanity as a whole in the existence of \ngold and copper mining at the headwaters of the Amazon Basin. At the same time, one \ncan hardly fault the survival tactics of these particular Shuar people. Their successful \npositioning in the context of a developing social -democratic state is admirable, and if the \ncost is their loss of immersion in the practical knowledge and universe of meaning that has \nsustained traditional Shuar health -seeking practices, the loss is at least as much ours as \ntheirs.  \nIn considering the medicinal plant usage of Shuar miners in the valley, then, one could say \nthat  there is little imperative for the intercultural reform of the state toward greater \ncultural representativeness. This is not because of any kind of rejection of the legitimacy \nof medicinal plants, or even a preference for the real or imaged benefits of ph armaceutical \nmedicine. The central issue was the pragmatic recognition of their own limited knowledge \n                                                        \n62 For a similar case of a capital oriented strategy of autonomous indigenous development, see Ramos \n(2014: 44).  241 \n of such plants in combination with the way in which they related to the possibility of their \nuse. On this count, the opinions of Jes\u00fas Tankamash of Churub ia were revealing:  \nThere are many different herbs, but we have forgotten them. One has to study a lot to be able \nto rescue this knowledge. One would have to make a nursery of each species, with each one \nnamed, but this would cost quite a bit of money. On top of that, if I want to sell these plants \noutside, I would need to find someone who already knew about all these plants, with their \nrespective names. That is the only way we could say we truly know our culture and fulfil our \nduty as Shuar. We can tell yo u the superficial knowledge, but we cannot explain it to you in \ndepth. We have grown up here, but we are not such experts. We have seen things while \ngrowing up, but we don\u2019t know everything.  \nThis testimony contains several curious elements. Perhaps most striking is a theme that \nwill be analysed in the next chapter: a sort of self -essentialising internalisation of \nindigenous identity politics to such an extent that it becomes possible to not kn ow one\u2019s \nown culture: that is to say, one\u2019s own practices, worldview and \u2018horizon of intelligibility\u2019. \nBeyond that, however, it is interesting to see that Jes\u00fas assumes that medicinal plants \nwould necessarily become the subject of expert knowledge, rather than being part of an \nindividual\u2019s base of knowledge about his or her environment that facilitates health and \nsurvival. One cannot help but observe the subjectivity of a worker in the wage economy in \nthis assumption that any productive activity, healing in cluded, should be performed by \nindividuals who dedicate themselves to performing exclusively that activity and are \nremunerated accordingly. This expectation stands in stark contrast to the demands on \nthose working in the subsistence economy to employ a wid e range of skills. Jes\u00fas\u2019s \ntestimony suggests, moreover, that such an expert initiative would be managed according \nto an economic rationale, with the necessary start -up investments and business plan for 242 \n sales to recoup those costs. His assumptions, in othe r words, reflect a classic proposition \nfor an economically rationalist sustainable development initiative, rather than a project \nthat could be achieved by pooling the existing time, knowledge and environmental \nresources of the collective. One might conclud e, then, that between Shuar miners and \nmestizo Ecuadorian society, individuals\u2019 aims in health -seeking behaviour and the \nsubsequent modality of their engagement with state healthcare is similar enough that \nthere is little need to \u2018interculturalise\u2019 healthc are\u2013whatever the mix of medicinal plants \nand pharmaceutical medicines in the materia medica \u2013because of the significant degree to \nwhich there is a shared subjectivity relating to time, labour and knowledge between these \ngroups.  \n \nThe Development and Rationa lisation of Shuar Communities?   \nTo what extent, then, does the entry of the mining industry into the Quimi River Valley \nrepresent a classically Weberian case of the disenchantment and rationalisation of a non -\ncapitalist culture and worldview? Judging by i nterviewees\u2019 responses, there does appear \nto be a greater tendency toward a \u2018consumerist\u2019 engagement with state healthcare, in \nwhich responsibility for explaining, treating and making meaning out of illness is \nabrogated to a professional specialist, perhap s borne out of expectations of specialisation \ndeveloped through personal experiences of performing specialised labour in the waged \neconomy. These testimonies finds a certain resonance with the work of \u2018post -\ndevelopment\u2019 critics such as Japhy Wilson, who de scribes development \u2018as a technology \nof power through which alienated social relations are actively produced\u2019 (2011: 1006). \nWilson\u2019s critique itself draws on the Marxist critique of capitalist alienation, specifically 243 \n Henri Lefebvre who decries the \u2018techno cratic rationality that divides the organic unity of \neveryday life into isolated fragments\u2019 (1996: 143). In other words, these critics would \nargue, in entering the waged economy Shuar miners are extracted from their former \nclosed economic system \u2013in which t heir survival depended on satisfying their own material \nneeds wholly through labouring to transform the elements of their immediate \nenvironment \u2013and subsequently experience alienation both in relation to the products of \ntheir own labour as well as the produ cts they rely upon for their material survival. They are \nthereby less inclined, the argument goes, to seek to satisfy their own healthcare needs, \nhaving become accustomed to acting as the passive recipients of the specialised labour of \nothers.  \nThe applicat ion of this interpretive frame to the Quimi River Valley is flawed in several \nways. Firstly, in characterising the capitalist economy as invading a formerly existent \nsphere of \u2018organic unity,\u2019 the critique of alienation in development portrays an \nexaggerat ed image of rupture when one could more accurately speak of a historical \ncontinuum moving toward rationalisation and specialisation. Shuar people outside the \nwaged economy still \u2018rationalise\u2019 their economic behaviour in accordance with providing \nfor their basic necessities via agriculture, hunting, construction, childcare, and so on. In \nhistorical perspective, one might even compare the close alignment between the fate of \nShuar social units and the exponential growth rates of biological processes to the boo m \nand bust cycles of contemporary capitalist economies: consider, as a simplified example, \nthe investment of agricultural surpluses into raising fowl, leading to larger and healthier \nfamily units, which then consume larger portions of the natural resource base through \nhunting and house construction and ultimately find themselves in conflict with \nneighbouring groups. To assume instead an ahistorical and discrete \u2018organic unity\u2019 in non -244 \n capitalist society is a fallacy borne of the structuralist bias in anthrop ology and the overuse \nof the ethnographic present.  \nBy contrast, there is clear evidence that before the arrival of ECSA, Shuar people were \nalready negotiating their involvement with globally embedded actors. It was by setting up \ncattle -raising cooperative s that the first Shuar federations enacted land rights claims, \nfelling their own forest as a compromise with Ecuadorian state laws surrounding land \nreform and the colonisation of the Amazon (Rubenstein, 2001: 280). More recently, \ncommunity associations, in cluding one in Alto Nangaritza, have signed \u2018Socio -Bosque\u2019 \nagreements with the national government, according to which areas of communally -titled \nterritory are demarcated as hunting -and-fishing reserves in exchange for cash payments, \na case of what could b e called the rationalisation of biodiverse space. This is a local \nmanifestation of the global tendency toward \u2018the commodification of ecosystem services\u2019 \n(Roberson, 2006) under the rubric of sustainable development. Clearly then, Shuar people \nare not only cognisant of the rationalisation of productive activities, but have and are \ncurrently seeking to negotiate engagement on favourable terms with an economically \nrationalist world -system.    \nThe critique of alienation, furthermore, relies on an imaginary of r ationalist modernity that \nis more ideology than reality. It has been argued, in fact, that the magnificent intangibility \nof global commodity production and exchange and its impalpable governance stimulates \npopular sectors\u2019 reification and mystification of their life -worlds when compared with \npreviously predominant modes of production (Comaroff & Comaroff, 2001). In the Quimi \nValley one is more likely to see subtle transformations of belief systems, rather than \ndisenchantment in the sense of wholesale erasur e: for example, Fernando Tsakimp\u2019s 245 \n description of iwianch , traditionally a demon with a form \u2018more or less human, although a \ngood deal uglier\u2019 (Harner, 1972: 150), as like slightly smaller versions of the gorillas he had \nseen in documentaries on television ; or Genesis Kayap\u2019s adaptation of treatments for \n\u2018susto\u2019 to ameliorating the shock felt by her young children when they saw a violent movie, \nwhere formerly the affliction was said to be caused by children\u2019s sudden visions of the \ndead (Descola, 1996: 233).  One could also point to the evidence of absorption of discourses \nof the \u2018hyperreal Indian\u2019 (Ramos, 1994) and of material progress itself, as demonstrating \nthe transformation of the symbolic universe of Shuar miners rather than the instigation of \na rationa list, utility maximising subjectivity.  \n \nProspects for Interculturality on the Quimi   \nThough the health -seeking behaviours testified to in the interviews given by residents of \nAlto Nangaritza differed greatly in their ontological, epistemological and cultu ral \nsuppositions from the rationalistic point of view occupied by biomedical healthcare and \nstate institutions, the responses from Shuar miners in the Quimi River Valley were almost \nas different again from those of their compatriots in Nangaritza. In their  perceptions of \nand engagements with shamanic healing, ancestral visionary practices and medicinal \nplants, most of the Quimi Valley waged miners were incredibly closely aligned with the \ncommon sense judgements made by westerners in liberal mass society reg arding \n\u2018personalistic\u2019 illness, medicinal plants and the relevance of transcendent spiritual \nexperience. Employing notions of ideal indigeneity reminiscent of global indigenous rights \ndiscourse, this group was able to separate themselves from identificatio n with \ncharacteristic elements of \u2018indigenous culture\u2019 such as shamanic healing and 246 \n hallucinogenic plant -inspired spiritual practices. They situated the relevance of these \nancestral practices away, either in time or in space, and saw themselves instead in \naccordance with subjectivities aligned with the discourses of economic progress, \nmonotheistic religion, or both.  \nEven in the absence of subjectivities produced by these discourses, however, the tendency \nto move away from the ancestral complex of health -seeking behaviours was still present. \nThe coercive impact of economic conditions was evident in these cases, particularly upon \nthe current generation of young parents. These interviewees\u2019 everyday economic \nactivities in the waged economy and the tacit assumpt ions they engendered around \nproductive specialisation marginalised the relevance to them of ancestral health -seeking \npractices. Thus, working -class interviewees frequently lamented their minimal knowledge \nof medicinal plants and testified that they would o f course consult with specialist medical \ndoctors in case of illness; while the elder, economically independent Shuar people prided \nthemselves on their knowledge and practice of traditionally Shuar health -seeking \nbehaviour and derided the ignorance of the y ounger generation.  \nIn sum, the study of this small region\u2019s health -seeking behaviour illustrates the \ninterdependence of structural economic factors and globally diffused discourses (religion, \nindigeneity and material progress) and the attendant subjectivi ties of both. Where health -\nseeking behaviours are marked as distinctively indigenous and alternate subjectivities have \nbeen generated; or when the transmission of a specific practice demands the \naccumulation of knowledge through continual immersion in the biophysical environment \nto an extent not possible for those in the waged economy, these ancestral health -seeking \nbehaviours tend to be abandoned. For this reason, the degree to which cultural difference 247 \n in the Quimi River Valley is significant enough to de mand meaningful intercultural reform \nin state healthcare is dependent on Shuar peoples\u2019 capacity to maintain independence \nfrom the economic regime of waged mining, as well as from the discourses of Evangelism \nand material progress, which present alternativ es to Shuar peoples\u2019 self -identification as \n\u2018truly indigenous\u2019 and, therefore, as appropriate practitioners of the distinctively \nAmazonian health -seeking practices of their recent ancestors. On a more fundamental \nlevel, however, the fact that many Shuar pe ople seem to consider a putative ly authentic \nindigenous identity as a necessity for the enjoyment of ancestral health -seeking \nknowledge practice is an emanation of the paradox presented by cultural rights. The \nmanoeuvre of celebrating certain kinds of know ledge practices entirely by virtue of their \ncultural particularity \u2013and relatedly, denouncing any involvement of outsiders in such \nknowledge practices as \u2018cultural imperialism\u2019 \u2013serves ultimately as a barrier to the further \nevolution, diffusion and hybridisa tion of knowledge practices like shamanic healing in \nwestern Amazonia, which are the legacy of the diversity of human experience \ncharacteristic of the pre -globalised world.   \n \n \n \n \n \n 248 \n Chapter 7: Medicine and Indigeneity \u2013Rewriting the Multivalent Discourse of I ndigenous \nCulture  \n \nThus far, this study has analysed the range of Shuar health -seeking practices and their \nattendant ontology in a geographically isolated region of traditional Shuar territory \n(Chapter 4), before breaking off and evaluating the relative im pact and interaction with \nShuar traditional practices of a pair of what have been termed cultural vectors: Protestant \nEvangelism (in Chapter 5) and waged mining (in Chapter 6). Both of these vectors had a \nsignificant effect on health -seeking practice and o ntology, as was made visible in the \nstatistical portrait developed in Chapter 3, which permitted comparison with knowledge \nand practice in regions and interviewee cohorts not permeated by these vectors. These \nchapters sought to explain this statistical div ergence in health -seeking preferences \nbetween Evangelical and non -Evangelical interviewees and between waged miners and \ninterviewees outside the waged economy. The former, on Evangelism, considered the \n(in)compatibility between the autochthonous and the in bound ontology and proposed \nthat the conflict was being generated via morally (rather than epistemologically) charged \ncontestations of the traditional ontology upon which health -seeking practices depended.  \nHaving established the nature of this clash, we w ere then free in Chapter 6 to explain the \nhealth -seeking practices of waged miners in the Quimi Valley, a more composite terrain of \nseveral interacting cultural vectors  including religion, political identity and economy. In this \nchapter, it became apparent  that health -seeking behaviours were not only affected by the \ncoercive impact of economic conditions on Shuar people\u2019s survival strategies, and \ntherefore on their day -to-day lives and experiences. These economic conditions also 249 \n stimulated the up -take of di scourses and subjectivities of modernity among Shuar people, \nthereby leading them to distance themselves from ancestral health -seeking practices, a \nphenomenon observed even among interviewees who maintained knowledge of these \npractices and belief in their efficacy. In this disjuncture between ancestral knowledge \npractices and modern subjectivity, the political identity of indigeneity was in fact \ninstrumental in these indigenous people\u2019s abandonment of the former and the adoption \nof the latter, in a manoeuvr e of identification with modernity that recalls the oft -made \npoint that identity is always affirmed in a relational sense against the other (e.g. de la \nCadena & Starn, 2009: 204). Ironically, for these indigenous people the other was located \nwith groups th ey identified as expressing ideal indigeneity, as celebrated in indigenous \nrights discourse and, indeed, in anthropology. This surprising conclusion regarding the \nlocal subjective impact of indigenous identity politics and the broader global discourse of \nindigenous rights constitutes one of the points of departure for the present chapter.  \nAlongside it stands the statistical grounding presented in Chapter 3. Table 6 of that chapter \nshowed that interviewees who expressed themselves in the cultural revivalist  discourse \ncharacteristic of the Pachakutik (PK) political party had no particular affinity for \nshamanism or visionary practices over and above those who did not express themselves \nin such a way. The PK -discourse group placed a greater importance on herbal  medicine and \na lesser importance on clinical medicine, but in both cases the difference was slight. Table \n7 showed, moreover, that this discourse has permeated all of the Shuar communities in \nthe present study, irrespective of the political affiliation of  said communities with PK and \nthe CONAIE confederation. Consequently, it would be untenable to attribute the absence \nof any statistical correlation between PK discourse and increased preference for \nemblematic \u2018indigenous\u2019 health practices to a supposed lac k of reach of this discourse. This 250 \n is especially so given that Pachakutik has controlled the Zamora -Chinchipe provincial \ngovernment since 2009.  \nThe only logical way to account for both the potential of PK discourse to shape \nsubjectivities and its lack of correlation with any specific trend in health -seeking behaviour \nis to propose the conclusion that its impact on Shuar behaviour and ontology is \nmultivalent: that is to say, it is taken up in different ways for different results depending \non the geographic and economic conditions with which it engages. The present chapter \nexplores this hypothesis about the multivalent deployments of the discourse of \nindigeneity, detailing the ways in which Shuar people think through their own identity as \nindigenous in the ex change with an outside researcher and the consequences of the \nsubjectivity they adopt for their engagement with traditional and clinical health -seeking \nbehaviour and with the broader Ecuadorian society. The way in which Shuar people \nleverage, struggle with  or distance themselves from themes of indigeneity in discussing \nhealthcare preferences illustrates its relevance (or lack thereof) to them in responding to \nquestions of life and death, and therefore to their deepest commitments about the nature \nof reality  and human life.  \nThe first section of this chapter will consider one of the ways in which indigenous rights \ndiscourse is mobilised by Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe: as an idiom invoking a history \nof resistance. For some interviewees, straight -forward in terview questions regarding \nmedicinal use prompted discussions that evolved into heartfelt accounts of struggles to \nmaintain autonomy and suspicion of state projects and mestizo people, in a manner of \ninvoking indigeneity that speaks to the work of indigen ous scholars with a strong historical \nconsciousness, such as Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui (2008) and Linda Tuhiwai Smith (1999). 251 \n These perspectives, most commonly expressed by residents of the geographically remote \nregion of Alto Nangaritza, illustrated the im portance to some Shuar people of achieving \nautonomy with respect to mestizo society and state institutions in particular, the question \nwhich lies at the heart of campaigns for interculturality.  \nSubsequently, in an effort to avoid uncritically portraying th e most marginalised and \noppositional Shuar as speaking with the voice of the people as a whole, the second section \nconsiders the effects of the discourse of indigeneity for Shuar people, and indigenous \nEcuadorians more broadly, who have achieved a degree o f political or economic power \nand social integration in the aftermath of the 1999 \u20132006 period of political upheaval. This \nsection addresses the distinctive characteristics apparent in mobilisations of the discourse \nof indigeneity from a position of relativ e power (relative to their more marginalised \nindigenous compatriots), including cases of occlusion of class and institutional interests. \nThe way in which such interviewees expressed their claims through indigeneity tended to \nplace greater emphasis on right s based on culture as opposed to rights based on history, \nas is more common in marginalised communities. They also expressed claims about the \nimportance of \u2018culture\u2019 as such, a terminology that was entirely absent among those most \nimmersed in traditional S huar lifeways.  \nIn light of this discussion of the role of the political capital of indigenous culture in \nexplaining its multivalent operations, the chapter concludes with a critique of recent \nanthropological invocations of indigeneity. It does this by extending upon the \nargumentation of the previous chapter, drawing attention to the ways in which discourses \nof indigenous rights and idealised expressions of indigeneity can alienate indigenous \npeoples themselves. This concluding section also addresses the contested meaning of 252 \n indigenous identity in spaces, such as the province of Zamora -Chinchipe as well as Ecuador \nas a whole, where multiple indigenous ethnicities co -exist. In this respect, the chapter is in \ndialogue with the minimal extant work on indigenous governmentality  (Erazo, 2010, 2011), \nas well as with the numerous, more general political analyses of indigenous social \nmovements and other actors in Ecuador and their role in national politics (Becker, 2010; \nBowen, 2011; Jameson, 2011; Lalander & Ospina P., 2012; Ram\u00edre z G., 2010). Without \ndisputing individuals\u2019 right to self -identify, I propose that given its multivalent nature, the \nuse of indigeneity as a positive value judgment needs to be less associated with identity \nclaims and reflexive esteem for \u2018culture\u2019 and mor e closely tied to history, whether the \nevaluations being made concern land rights, the ecological sustainability of socio -\neconomic systems, or the relative sophistication of knowledge systems.  \n \nIndigeneity as an Idiom of Resistance  \nThe first sense in whic h the discourse of indigeneity appeared in interviews with Shuar \npeople about their health -seeking practices and preferences was as a register for invoking \nthe history of their local region and its people\u2019s resistance to colonisers, mestizo \nEcuadorian soci ety and globalisation as a whole. This history would be framed around the \nassumption that \u2018pre -contact\u2019 Shuar society63 did not suffer from poverty and health \nafflictions to the same extent as Shuar people today; and as such, had no need for the \nclinical me dical coverage that is now provided by the state. At the same time, such \n                                                        \n63 I place the term in inverted commas because the rapid colonisation of the majority of Shuar territory in \nZamora -Chinchipe during the twentieth century was in fact the second -round of confrontation between \nHispanic colonial society and Shuar people, the fi rst having resulted in the colonists being repelled at the \nend of the sixteenth century. Nor was their any notion of \u2018society\u2019 or \u2018the public\u2019 in a Habermasian sense to \nbe found among Shuar people during this epoch.  253 \n interviewees avoided reference to aspects of traditional society, such as endemic warfare \nand the kidnapping of women (Descola, 1996: 192 -3), which have been superseded, \nthereby paint ing a generally negative portrait of their current situation by contrast with \ntraditional life.  \nFigure 10: Driving cattle through the mud in Alto Nangaritza  \n \nA paradigmatic example of this manner of thinking through health -seeking preferences in \nterms of  a historical consciousness of indigeneity and resistance to colonial society comes \nfrom Antonio Tukupi, an Evangelical man who lived about an hour\u2019s walk outside the town \nof Shaime. Antonio proposed that:  \nThey [medical doctors] sell them [pharmaceuticals]  because those are their orders. But we, \nas Shuar, have analysed this subject substantially, and our ancestors, our elders, never knew \n254 \n of remedies such as these: pills, clinics, hospitals, injections. They cured themselves with their \nown medicines, those t hat they found, natural ones. That is how they cured themselves. They \nwere strong and brave.  \nAnd by contrast, what are we? Our grandfathers, our ancestors, they never ate \u2018cubanos\u2019 [a \nbreed of chicken raised for commercial farming], which are chemical.  Now adays, what \nhappens with us? In recent years, we have changed our attitudes, we have become somewhat \nmore civilised, and we eat everything: rice, chicken, \u2018cubanos\u2019, that the colonisers sell. And \nthis instead of raising our own chickens naturally \u2013\u2018pollos c riollos\u2019, the healthier ones, natural, \nwithout chemicals, and which only need maize,  cassava and plantain, rather than feed.  \nThe meaning here is clear and explicit: health problems originate with colonisation, and as \nsuch avoiding all facets of colonial so ciety, including its food and medicine, is the best way \nto ensure Shuar people\u2019s health and strength.  \nA similar example of an invocation of indigeneity as a paradise lost through the colonial \nencounter came from \u00d3scar Taish, who was \u2018Vice -S\u00edndico\u2019 of Shaim e and also ran for an \nelected position on a Nangaritza municipality in the 2014 elections on the PK ticket. \u00d3scar \nfirstly puts forward the claim that Ecuadorian society has brought numerous health \nproblems to Shuar territory:  \nAnd now, well, we are in this  world, open, and there are so many illnesses, and perhaps our \ngrandfathers never knew of so many. And now we are all involved, like one single family. One \nperson goes out to the city, another returns, and there are so many health problems.  \nHe then elabora tes on this point by comparing the newly emerging health problems faced \nby Shuar people with the coverage provided by the public health system. When asked the 255 \n standard question on whether his children had been vaccinated at the local clinic, \u00d3scar \npondered  on the issue as follows:  \n\u2013 It\u2019s an obligation now. If you want to have an identification card, you need to be \nvaccinated.  \n\u2013 What do you think about this?  \n\u2013 Well, if you don\u2019t have these documents you can\u2019t do many processes. Whether it makes \nus well or not, we have to do it. It\u2019s the same with avoiding rabies. We have to have our dogs \nvaccinated. We never knew of this before. For the sake of prevention, we have these things \ndone. After all, the bats come, and with a bite rabies can spread. But then again , how many \ntimes have I been bitten by bats, and I\u2019ve never been sick. I think prevention is a good thing. \nBut then again, before we never had so many things like this.  \nThen we see sometimes that after being vaccinated the baby develops a fever, and they s ay, \nwell, that is a symptom of the vaccine. So then they have to be bathed and they suffer. I think \nit is a preventative measure that they are doing. But then again, what vaccines (\u2018qu\u00e9 \nvacunas\u2019)?! Our ancestors never did this, and they lived well (\u2018vivier on tranquilos\u2019). Possibly \nthey did have problems with illnesses, but they lived, and possibly they lived longer and were \nstronger. And nowadays, despite all of these programs, we keep having more and more \nproblems.  \nHere, \u00d3scar\u2019s narrative creates a juxtapo sition of viewpoints between the technical policy \ninterventions of the Ecuadorian state\u2019s public health programs and Shuar people\u2019s own \nperspective on their sense of deteriorating collective well -being. This point can be read as \nparalleling the common crit icism of pharmaceuticals provided by the clinic as \u2018calmantes\u2019 \n(sedatives), in that the overall engagement with colonial society is seen to have brought a 256 \n variety of problems for which the public health system is only able to provide partial or \ntemporary s olutions.  \nA very similar point is made by Ricardo Naanch when he outlines his own perspective on \npublic health interventions from a standpoint of poverty and marginalisation.  \nYou know, we have to work so much, and from this work comes weariness, and from this \ncomes illness. So much tiredness makes illnesses emerge from you. That is why we go for \ncheck -ups. But then, there are the medicines and the vitamins that we take from the \npharmacy, but they are worth nothing to us. They don\u2019t cure us. Or if they do c ure us, it\u2019s just \nfor a while. It alieves you for a while, but within two weeks the same sickness is back.  \nIn other words, where medical science presumes that individuals\u2019 basic material \nsustenance is accounted for, and from there visualises illness as a deviation from the norm \nrequiring a targeted physiological intervention, this testimony from Ricardo reframes the \nquestion of public health in the context of economic marginalisation and the baseline \nstruggle for survival. It could also be interpreted as d rawing on the Shuar notion, discussed \nin Chapter 4, that strength and sickness are at opposite ends of a continuum, where illness \nhas been understood as the result of magical attacks emanating from those more \npowerful than oneself, and strength signifies i mperviousness to both disease and physical \naggression from others (Harner, 1972: 135 -9). In this sense, it may be a logical extrapolation \nfor \u00d3scar and Ricardo to interpret Shuar people\u2019s suffering not as a circumstance that just \nis, but rather as the resu lt of the deliberate action of others.  \nRicardo then elaborates on the point following a simple question about his preference \nbetween clinical or herbal medicine:  257 \n I would prefer nothing from the clinic. Like when a woman is having trouble with childbirth, \nI\u2019d rather have her supported here. We\u2019ll cook her a \u2018caldo de gallina\u2019 (chicken broth) and \nthat\u2019s how she can gather strength. But it has to be a mature chicken, and \u2018criollo\u2019  rather than \n\u2018cubano\u2019 (a breed for commercial farming), because those ones are i njected with all sorts of \nstuff. The \u2018criollo\u2019  is grown up right here and it has much more strength and hardness in it. \nThat\u2019s why it is more valuable to eat. It\u2019s important for a woman to eat plenty of chicken so \nshe doesn\u2019t get too skinny and become weak  and get sick. Whereas if I take her to the \nhospital, she can get all sorts of treatments, but she won\u2019t recover at all. But with what I can \ngive her here, she will recover.  \nRicardo is expressing clearly a point that political systems worldwide rarely appe ar to have \ngrasped: that is, that public health properly conceived would ensure the satisfaction of \nbasic necessities before focusing on provision of pharmaceuticals, specialist treatments, \nvitamin injections and so on. For Shuar people robbed of much of t heir land and \nconcentrated in abandoned mission towns with a strained natural resource base, \neconomic precariousness is a reality that free clinical healthcare can only partially abate. It \nis from this broader sense of suffering from the engagement with co lonisation that many \nShuar people concluded that it would be preferable to make use of medicinal plants over \nclinical medicine \u2013\u2018that which is ours,\u2019 as so many interviewees said, or \u2018products from us \nShuar, to be healthy,\u2019 in Ricardo\u2019 words \u2013even as they al so often lamented their own lack \nof knowledge about medicinal plants. Their conclusion should not be seen as ethnocentric \nin character. On the contrary, the preference for traditional over clinical medicine among \nthis group seemed to be one part of a broad er stance toward the Ecuadorian state based \non a historical consciousness of indigeneity as resistance to colonialism, rather than being \ndelimited to a strict, technical evaluation of the relative efficacy of different medicines.  258 \n Beyond this general prefe rence for indigenous medicine, the discourse of indigeneity as \nhistorical consciousness could also be seen to generate radical opposition to the clinical \nmedicine of the state health system. This attitude toward state clinics was a subset of the \nrelatively  common stance of outright hostility toward mestizo Ecuadorians and outsiders \nin general.64 Again, in Ricardo Naanch\u2019s words:  \nHere in the clinic, they treat us all the time and they have lots of treatments, but we end up as \nsick as ever. These same treatmen ts cause us even more illness later. So many injections, so \nmany vitamins, they just cause more illness. [\u2026]  \nThe colonisers, they have a lot of envy of us as Shuar. The colonisers want to do away with \nthe race of Shuar altogether, and produce purely their race (\u2018la raza de colonos\u2019), [like] the \nColombians and others. They want to do away with all the native people (\u2018Quieren terminarles \na los nativos toditos\u2019). So of course, when we go to the hospital, they help us, and then they \ngive us bad injections and b ad remedies and bad treatments, and we don\u2019t realise because we \ndon\u2019t know what kind of remedy it is.  \nSure, we have some idea \u2013\u2018this is a remedy for fever,\u2019 \u2018this is a remedy for allergies\u2019 \u2013but we \ndon\u2019t know exactly what these products do, and they could be  doing us harm (\u2018da\u00f1o\u2019) too. So \nmany people go to them to be cured, or they\u2019ll go to the hospital, but afterwards the same \nillness comes back. This isn\u2019t curing. It\u2019s the very hospitals and pharmacies that are giving us \nthis sickness.  \nSo when I get sick I don\u2019t go to them for cures. Well, for some sickness, for fevers, I do go, but \nfor the rest I won\u2019t. I have to stay in my house and look for some product to drink in order to \n                                                        \n64 In Shaime, the doctor who served ther e had purchased an outboard motor to allow him easier access to \nthe town by river, but it was stolen shortly after. Similarly, the school -teacher had had personal items \nstolen from her lodging in town.  259 \n make myself healthy. This same doctor that we go to here [at the clinic] to examine us, this \nsame doctor can kill us. I\u2019ve seen this.  \nThere are so many injections available in the city, and that\u2019s where the colonisers are as well. \nThe colonisers envy us, the Shuar race. The colonisers recognise us as Shuar, and we don\u2019t \nknow the medicines, so we let them inject us. And then if we die, who\u2019s going to say anything? \nI have seen many people killed by doctors. I have seen it.  \nAgain, through a discourse of opposition driven by historical consciousness of conflict with \nmestizo Ecuadorian society, preferences between types of healthcare are decided with \nmuch broader terms of reference than simply the properties and efficacies of m edicines. \nThe flaws in the way the public health system works for Shuar people are, moreover, \ninterpreted as evidence that mestizo society has no interest in the well -being of indigenous \nAmazonians. Such attitudes account for the statistical correlation be tween use of the \ndiscourse of indigenous identity and a lower willingness to make use of clinical medicine.  \nThese oral testimonies constitute local accounts which enter into dialogue with broader \ncritiques of the role of public health programs in the cont ext of poverty and \nmarginalisation. Such critiques include numerous works by Paul Farmer (1996, 2003, 2004), \nfor whom the public health consequences of poverty, marginalisation and structural \nviolence constitute the central theme of his research. In a simi lar vein, an ethnography of \na Colombian plantation town by Michael Taussig draws attention to the fetishisation of \npharmaceuticals in health programs:  \nThose who went to these doctors would receive huge prescriptions for veritable cornucopiae \nof pills, cap sules and injectable substances, and return to the same dirty water and food \nshortage that created the preconditions of the health problem in the first place (1987: 274).  260 \n Likewise, Ethel Wara Alderete draws attention to \u2018sicknesses of poverty,\u2019 arguing th at the \n\u2018health conditions of native peoples are determined in large measure by their low socio -\neconomic position\u2019 (2004: 65). She also points out, however, that development indicators \noften paint a misleading picture of these conditions, given that \u2018catego ries of poverty or \nunemployment, for example, are inadequate in quantifying the material assets and \nresources of rural life\u2019 (2004: 64). Consequently, a key feature of indigenous public health \nis \u2018the conservation of traditional lifeways and culture\u2019 (2004 : 65), rather than solely \ntechnical interventions based on medical science. Alderete argues that \u2018territory, family \nand social relationships, environmental problems, food security, spiritual strength and \nintercultural relations form an integral part\u2019 of pu blic health for indigenous peoples (2004: \n66).65  \nThis intervention speaks directly to the points made by interviewees invoking indigeneity \nas a discursive frame for discussing health in the context of historical consciousness. The \nseemingly tangential resp onses of interviewees to the standard, focused questions on \npreferences between medical systems in fact implied a desire for recontextualisation of \nthe debate about health and medicine. Segundo Santiak, another outspoken Shuar man \nand former community lead er,66 began by saying that \u2018the only medicines that we believe \n                                                        \n65 They are of course significant to non -indigenous peo ples, but are vitally important to maintain for \nindigenous peoples, who are so vulnerable to the effects of dislocation provoked by the colonial \nencounter.  \n66 The way in which my mode of textual analysis of interviews \u2013which are themselves public speech act s, at \ntimes undertaken with individuals with whom I had a minimal personal connection \u2013privileges the more \neffusive interviewees is one manner in which gender bias manifests in the present study, as Jivaroan \nsocieties tend to place great importance on verba l force and eloquence in men, while valuing modesty and \ndemureness in women (Descola, 1996: 193, 195). That said, where circumstances made private conversation \npermissible I was able to record lengthy interviews with some women, of whom Alma Tunki, Martina  and \nElsa Tukupi, Laura and Teresa Yankuam and Ximena Charip were particularly influential in the development \nof this thesis.  261 \n in are our own products\u2019 and \u2018what comes from outside doesn\u2019t compare with what we \nhave. Ours is higher, and what comes in is lower.\u2019 However, he goes on to argue:  \nThis is where we find ourselv es, but our government\u2026God shouldn\u2019t allow it, but even he \nhimself doesn\u2019t realise what is being done to our poor people, our poor nationality, how we \nindigenous people are castigated. Traditional medicines will be all gone and they\u2019ll put only \ntheir medic ines. And us, where will we be? [\u2026] The government says there are no Shuar and \nthere are no indigenous people in Ecuador, only mestizos.  \nFor Segundo, the issue is not the minimal point that Shuar medicines are preferable, but \nthe notion that the Ecuadorian  state is attempting to wipe these medicines out so as to \nweaken the Shuar people and change the traditional way of life. Chapter 4 detailed the \nrole played by medicinal plants in Shuar culture in a range of fields that westerners would \ncategorise as inclu ding education, socialisation, spirituality and therapy. In this context, \nindigeneity as historical consciousness of resistance to colonialism implies a health -seeking \npractice centred on the defence of medicinal plants used to inspire visionary experience s \nof transcendence. To speak of intercultural health in this sense recalls the political \nsignificance of vision -seeking practices for indigenous North Americans in the late \nnineteenth century and early twentieth century as they faced the advancing colonial  \nfrontier (Niezen, 2000). Indeed, when Segundo expounds on the virtues of medicinal \nplants, with ayahuasca ( nat\u00e9m ) most prominent among them, his criteria are in no way \nlimited to the physiological, but in fact merge these with personal and social values:  \n\u2013 Did your father [the town\u2019s foremost shaman] give you medicines from a young age?  \n\u2013 Yes, from the age of eight we started. With nat\u00e9m , with many products so that our blood \nmay be strong, we may be valiant, have good energy (\u2018una energ\u00eda buena\u2019), alkali ne blood \n(\u2018sangre amarga\u2019), so that nothing can touch us. This is how we have been.  262 \n \u2013 Is this something you have done for your own children?  \n\u2013 Of course. Once they are eight or nine years old. This [experience] goes on and on and \nstays with them. Once th ey are eight or ten years old, you apply this, and from this age, they \ncontinue on following their visions, thinking very differently, of what they might have in \ntime, what might happen when they\u2019re 24 years old, this is what we always see in these \nvisions .  \n\u2013 What changes do you note in children when they have been given nat\u00e9m ? \n\u2013 A great difference! They think differently. They think of the development of the \ncommunity.  \nFor the Shuar people who understand their indigeneity in terms of a historical \nconsciou sness of resistance to colonisation, then, the principle of state interculturality is \nmore pressing than elsewhere. Those Shuar who are most marginalised not only \nexperience the greatest divergence between what they need to be healthy and how they \ninterpre t health in comparison with what the state public health system provides; they are \nalso the most ready to interpret these state failings as deliberate policies of cultural and \ndemographic aggression on the part of mestizo society. As such, autonomous \nmanag ement of the resources dedicated to public health is most important in these \nmarginalised areas where consciousness of their indigenous identity is understood in \nterms of the history of colonialism and the experience of it as an ongoing reality.  \n \nIndigenei ty as \u2018Culture\u2019: Class, Politics and Institutions  \nThe preceding section introduced Shuar people\u2019s understanding of indigeneity in the \nsense of referencing the common experience of (still) being subject to colonialism, 263 \n dispossession and marginalisation. Wh ile it would be premature to minimise the relevance \nof that history to what it means to be indigenous in Ecuador, it is true that some indigenous \ngroups are emerging from that history and beginning to prosper. For Shuar people, \nPachakutik\u2019s control of prov incial governments in Zamora -Chinchipe and Morona -\nSantiago, the existence of a network of \u2018intercultural bilingual\u2019 schools, the isolated work \nof environmentalist NGOs and the economic importance of \u2018artisan\u2019 mining in the region \n(see Chapter 6) have all c ontributed to opening up spaces which belie any strict division \nbetween colonial society and indigenous Shuar territory. While \u2018artisan\u2019 mining provides \nthe greatest degree of economic empowerment for Shuar people, it is probably the \npresence of Shuar repr esentatives in public -sector offices that has contributed most to \nlegitimising the Amazonians\u2019 presence in urban spaces, which one nevertheless still sees \ncontested in small ways, such as the graffiti in Zamora that reads \u2018Zona Cholos\u2019 (\u2018mestizo \nzone,\u2019 rou ghly translated).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 264 \n Figure 11: Statue outside Zamora police station. The banner painted on the wall to the left \nreads: \u2018In the soul, God, in the heart, Country, and in the blood, Police.\u2019  \n \nThe reclaiming of indigenous culture and identity in Ecuador  since the uprisings of the \n1990s, which could be seen as a manifestation of broader global trends toward recognition \n265 \n of cultural and ethnic difference (Hale, 1997, 2004; Rouse, 1995; Yashar, 2004), has had its \nimpact felt even in remote Amazonian regions.  The conceiving of indigeneity in terms of \nculture arose in a number of the interviews recorded with those who made use of the \ndiscourse characteristic of Pachakutik and indigenous rights campaigns. In conversations \non his family\u2019s use of traditional medic ine, Celestino Wampash, a Shaime resident and \nteacher in the bilingual education department, lamented that \u2018because education has been \nadvancing, the youth do not place much importance on culture. [\u2026] What is ours must be \nmaintained. All the knowledge and customs must be maintained, and the language at \nleast.\u2019 Similarly, Edguin Yankuam of Wampishuk in Alto Nangaritza said, \u2018Sometimes we \nhave to go to the health clinic in Shaime, or even to Zamora. But the important thing is \nthat, like our forefathers, we ha ve our cultural medicines.\u2019 Matilde Yankuam of Kiim \nreferred to herbal medicine as \u2018natural medicines, all the medicines that we cultivate as \npart of rescuing our culture.\u2019 Justino Wampash from Shaime said, \u2018They believed in these \nthings before. Now we are  forgetting our own culture. We believe more in the pharmacy \nand that\u2019s where we go.\u2019 In each of these comments, there is an evident reification of \nShuar culture as something that is potentially separate from themselves and more \nproperly located in the pas t than the present, as though it were, in the perspective \ndescribed by N\u00e9stor Garc\u00eda Canclini (1992: 196), a piece of folklore on the verge of \ndisappearance. This is in contradistinction to the possibility of Shuar people seeing their \nculture as the web of  meaning within which all their actions and aspirations are located, \nconstantly recreated in their actions and choices they make in their everyday lives.  \nThat said, in all of these examples interviewees attributed significance to the use of Shuar \nhealth -seeking practices at least partly because of the value they attribute to traditional \nmedicine as an expression of this reified notion of indigenous culture. At least, then, in 266 \n terms of this contribution toward encouraging the preservation and further develop ment \nof knowledge practices, cultural rights discourse seems to be having a beneficial impact \non Shuar people. However, as mentioned in Chapter 6, the fact that this empowerment is \nachieved through the language of cultural rights \u2013in other words, rights fou nded on the \nclaim of representing a distinct culture \u2013has implications which have been described as \n\u2018complex and contradictory\u2019 (Cowan, 2006: 9). Framing indigeneity as a cultural \ndifference \u2013rather than a difference that references a history of autonomous s ocial \ndevelopment and consciousness of the subsequent experience of colonialism, \ndispossession and marginalisation \u2013implies dramatically different forms of redress. Cultural \ndifference typically implies a minimal demand for recognition and inclusion (Hale, 2002: \n485), while indigeneity as historical consciousness \u2013or what Walter Mignolo calls \u2018colonial \ndifference\u2019 (2000b: 740) \u2013demands the right to control engagement with the colonising \nsociety from a position of autonomy and self -determination. This distincti on can be \nexplained by drawing attention to the confusion between culture as ontology \u2013\u2018a total \nsystem of conceptualisation\u2019 (Wagner, 1981: 142) \u2013and culture as defined within modern \nwestern ontology \u2018as more or less exotic ways of accounting for the state o f the world \nthat our own system of conceptualisation has established\u2019 (Descola, 2013: 30).67 While the \nformer establishes culture as a complete set of unique, historically developed ideas with \nwhich to conceptualise and act within the world, the latter subo rdinates \u2018the cultural\u2019 to a \nputatively true, post -cultural western worldview. For this reason, the revolutionary \npotential of interculturality requires an ontological definition of culture. By accepting the \nframing of themselves and their difference from mainstream national society as \u2018cultural\u2019 \n                                                        \n67 Note the parallel with the Ecuadorian plurinationalism movement\u2019s objective \u2018to demand the \ntransformation of the mono -cultural n ation -state and not to simply add their difference to the existing \ndominant normative matrix\u2019 (Walsh, 2002: 29).  267 \n in the second sense, Shuar and other indigenous people risk being taken into account in \nways that are entirely alien to and excluding of their own \u2018culture\u2019 in the first sense.  \nIn part, this contradiction between v aluing one\u2019s own historically developed knowledge \npractices through an interpretive frame (\u2018indigenous culture\u2019) formulated by outsiders \nmanifests in Shuar people\u2019s resentments of those holding institutional and political \npositions that are dependent on th eir identity as Shuar. Those who learn to represent \nShuar people and culture within mestizo society are able to benefit at the same time as \nthey distance themselves from immersion in the ancestral lifeways coextensive with that \nculture. One Shuar employee at the Office of the Bilingual Intercultural Education \nDepartment in Zamora68 was forcefully condemned by some community leaders in \nNangaritza because he was seen as profiting from speaking on behalf of Shuar people \nwhilst spending most of his time in the t own rather than in the jungle. Another Nangaritza \nman, a political official working for the Pachakutik provincial government, was held in \ncontempt by some for leaving his wife and family to survive off the land without him while \nhe lived and worked in the city. In both of these cases, furthermore, denunciations of these \n\u2018cultural professionals\u2019 were grounded in direct ethical judgements rather than any claim \nto holding a superior understanding of a reified and essentialised \u2018Shuar culture.\u2019  \nInferring from this line of reasoning, one could suggest that anthropologists would be \nseen as the most contemptible of those who speak about the lived culture of others. The \npreviously cited Ricardo Naanch voiced his concern about researchers as follows:  \n                                                        \n68 This office has since been merged into the Ministry of Education, but the Shuar teachers and \nadministrators who managed intercultural and bil ingual components of the education program were \nretained.  268 \n The colonisers come here as well, and they take photos. They take photos, photos, and \nphotos, then they take them and sell them, and they are earning a lot. Even one\u2019s word, the \nwords that one says, these are being bought. These words that are spoken here  and taken \nover there, and that\u2019s the way he spoke. They take these words, and then they take \naway\u2026how it was spoken, I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t quite understand it. They take away the words \nand these words that one speaks oneself are reproduced much more and t hen you make big \nearnings from it. You make earnings from this, saying, \u2018He spoke in this way.\u2019 You take it back \nwith you there and you have your earnings.  \nThis suspicion toward researchers and \u2018cultural professionals\u2019 should not be construed as \noutright opposition to the alienation and development of knowledge embedded in a local \ncontext \u2013what Charles Briggs calls \u2018rights to decontextualize\u2019 (1996: 459) \u2013along the lines \nof the denunciations of \u2018symbolic violence\u2019 made by Ronald Nigh (2002: 451) against \nphar maceutical bioprospecting research based on indigenous medicinal knowledge. In \nfact, during the research process I was continually encouraged to push on with the project \nby Shuar people who enthusiastically offered their own input. Rather, the issue that a rises \nis with the alienation of knowledge to institutional contexts that are neither controlled by \nnor accessible to most Shuar people. This is an essential lesson for any attempt to develop \ntruly intercultural, culturally representative state institutions .  \nAlongside the Shuar cultural professionals, the elder land -owners in the Quimi River Valley \nwere the most ready to adopt the discourse of indigeneity as culture and to adopt the \nthemes of idealised indigeneity employed in global indigenous rights campai gns. The same \ndiscursive themes were common to the two brothers who were the eldest men in Yanua \n(non -miners). The \u2018s\u00edndico\u2019 of Yanua, for example, declared in the midst of an inspired \nmonologue:  269 \n They say that the Shuar is lazy and that is why he is poor,  and that in contrast the \u2018campesino\u2019 \nworks hard, produces timber and makes change. But the Shuar have known how to protect \nand conserve the forest, so that animals don\u2019t leave us when the water is damaged, the \n\u2018p\u00e1ramos\u201969 themselves. The \u2018campesino\u2019 doesn\u2019 t think of this. He thinks only of money.  \nThe reference to \u2018p\u00e1ramo\u2019 is particularly revealing here, because of its evocative status in \nEcuadorian political discourse as the source of the country\u2019s water. This clearly has little \nhistoric relevance for Shuar  people, but has evidently been adopted as a discursive theme \nby this Shuar leader following its repeated invocation by Andean indigenous political \nactors. Also notable are the claims about Shuar patrimony over and conservation of the \nforest, a theme that was invoked in similar fashion by the brother of the \u2018s\u00edndico\u2019 following \na simple question about the availability of medicinal plants in the immediate vicinity of his \nhouse:  \nThere are medicines around this area, many different medicines. This nature belong s to us, \nwhich is why it hurts us when it is destroyed. There are edible plants from the forest that \nnourish us. So it pains us to see that our government goes beyond the Constitution and \nsmashes us. We claim our indigenous rights based on the Constitution , but this government \nis harming the Amazon. We don\u2019t want nature to be destroyed. This water is life, and not just \nfor Ecuador, but for the world. Water has no price. Money makes the man, but water has no \nprice. It\u2019s a gift from God. [\u2026] We are beings of the Earth, so very small in comparison with \nGod. God didn\u2019t send us here to destroy. We are here to protect nature. We care for the forest, \nfor the animals. We are children of our ancestors, from here.  \n                                                        \n69 \u2018P\u00e1ramo\u2019 refers to a type of high -mountain tropical ecosystem above the continuous forest line and \nbelow the permanent snow line.  270 \n It should not be considered suspect in and of itself t hat these interviewees positioned \nthemselves in such close alignment with the global discourse of indigenous peoples as \nstewards of \u2018nature\u2019, along the lines put forward by scholars such as Cavalcantini (2010), \nMaybury -Lewis (1992), Milliken (2010) and Pos ey and Overal (1990) and adopted by many \nindigenous organisations in their self -representation (Conklin & Graham, 1995: 697; Ulloa, \n2001; Viatori, 2007: 112, 115). What is significant, rather, is the scarcity of environmentalist \nrhetorical themes among Shu ar people generally, even among those who make use of \nPachakutik discourse; and the fact that it was taken up most enthusiastically by these two \nShuar men who had some of the greatest access to arable land and forested territory for \nhunting of any that I m et in the province.  \nFigure 12: Cornfield bordering cattle pasture on Shuar communally -titled land in the Quimi \nRiver Valley  \n \n271 \n To point out in this way that indigeneity can have implications for individuals\u2019 institutional \nand/or class interests is not to privilege the material over the discursive or to say that all \nindividuals\u2019 language and beliefs are necessarily cynically constructed fa\u00e7ades disguising \npersonal interests. As \u00c1rturo Escobar argues, \u2018There is no materiality that is not mediated \nby discours e, just as there is no discourse that is unrelated to materialities\u2019 (1995: 130). \nWith regard to the particular interests highlighted in this section, the point is simply that \nthere are certain subjectivities suggested or privileged by certain forms of dis course that \nare simply irrelevant to many individuals \u2013particularly young people \u2013as they go about the \nprocess of socialisation and material adaptation to the circumstances they have inherited. \nThat is to say, in the context of Zamora -Chinchipe it is unsurpr ising that young Shuar \npeople do not identify with the association of indigeneity with a discourse of \nenvironmental stewardship when their elders have not granted them any land for which \nthey might act as caretakers. As a general, concluding point, then, t his capacity of \nindigeneity to both facilitate individuals\u2019 negotiations of political and economic space \nwithin the existing order, as well as to act as an analytical tool invoking a historical \nconsciousness of resistance to that order, demonstrates the di scursive multivalency of \nindigeneity.  \n \nThe Distinct Deployments and Rejections of Indigeneity by Shuar People  \nWhen analysing the variety of discursive options through which individuals may identify \nand express themselves, there is always the temptation to  invent an imaginary clean slate \nto which individuals arrive and are able to make choices unencumbered by the choices of \nothers. And while most would accept the Foucaultian notions that power and knowledge 272 \n are fluid and are re -expressed at every node in th e networks through which they circulate, \nthis by no means implies that every individual has sufficient power to reappropriate, \nreinvent and redefine discursive themes. As such, this chapter will conclude with a \nconsideration of Shuar people\u2019s responses to the conceptualisation of indigeneity by two \npowerful discursive forces: firstly, indigenous governmentality as expressed by the \nPachakutik party in Ecuador; and secondly, anthropologists as international authorisers of \nthe social capital of indigeneity.  \nAs discussed in Chapter 3, the oppositional discourse relied upon by Pachakutik during its \norigins in the indigenous uprisings of the 1990s became much more difficult to sustain as \nthe possibilities of power approached in the twenty -first century. The party has wrestled \nwith this problem since the aborted coup in 2000, in which then CONAIE President Antonio \nVargas joined with the military in an attempt to replace President Jamil Mahuad. More \nrecently, the alliance between Pachakutik and Alianza Pa\u00eds during th e 2007 constituent \nassembly and the first two years of the Correa government ended up provoking further \nsoul -searching, leading to the party\u2019s current reluctance to enter into alliances with \ngovernment. The conflict over oil at Dayuma, which prompted the r esignation of Correa\u2019s \nSecretar\u00eda de Comunicaci\u00f3n, M\u00f3nica Chuji, drew attention to the more fundamental \ncontradiction for Pachakutik as a party of government: that is, that in striving to represent \ndozens of distinct organisations across the Andes and Amaz on, PK -CONAIE was unable to \nmaintain an internal consensus on the central dilemma for the Ecuadorian left between \nsocialist development, on the one hand, and \u2018anti -extractivism\u2019 and unequivocal support \nfor indigenous prior, informed consent, on the other. Correa\u2019s government opposed the \nlatter, arguing that it signified an indigenous veto over national economic policy (Trujillo, \n2010: 19).  273 \n This tension between socialist development and indigenous prior, informed consent \nmanifested in the national debate ov er the cancellation of the Yasun\u00ed -ITT proposal, \naccording to which developed nations would compensate the Ecuadorian state for leaving \nproven Amazonian oil reserves underground. CONAIE -PK was unable to come to a unified \nresponse to Correa\u2019s decision to go ahead with Yasun\u00ed oil extraction, with pro -government \nleaders in the central and northern Andes broadly in favour of developmentalist policies \nthat channelled funds from natural resource extraction to infrastructure projects managed \nby municipal and provin cial governments (Cano, 2014). Broadly speaking, the PK -led \nopposition in Zamora -Chinchipe and Morona -Santiago and the Ecuarunari -led opposition \nin Azuay, Ca\u00f1ar and Loja were unable to win over their northern Andean indigenous \ncolleagues in Tungurahua, Chi mborazo, Cotocachi, Pichincha and Imbabura, where \nelectoral support for the Correa government remained overwhelming in majority -\nindigenous regions (S\u00e1nchez Parga, 2013: 49). As such, PK -CONAIE was unable to exert \nitself in concerted mobilisations in the pe riod from the aborted coup of 30 September 2010 \nuntil the August 2015 protests, which were held in response to the prospect of \nconstitutional changes to permit indefinite presidential re -election.  \nThis tension in finding consensus between the various indig enous sectors of Ecuador \nmanifests in Zamora -Chinchipe in conflicts between Shuar and Kichwa -Saraguro groups.70 \nShuar people\u2019s identity as indigenous holds a confused position vis -a-vis the discourse and \npolitics of Pachakutik. This dissonance stems from th e dominance of the Kichwa \nnationality, language and worldview within the Ecuadorian indigenous movement as a \n                                                        \n70 This conflict is not only at the level of political difference. In August 2013, during my fieldwork in \nNangaritza \u2018cant\u00f3n\u2019, a dispute over land in the Yacuambi Valley near Kiim between Kichwa -Saraguro and \nShuar people left four people hospitalised with machete wounds (La Hora, 2013).  274 \n whole, Pachakutik itself and the party in Zamora -Chinchipe in particular. Some 72 percent \nof Ecuador\u2019s indigenous population identify as Kichwa, as  against the 8 percent identifying \nas Shu ar (Mart\u00ednez Novo, 2014: 412). Traditionally, k ey aspects of Kichwa culture include \nthe pre -eminence of notions of time in which the past and the present co -exist (Greenway, \n1998: 996), the complementarity between t he four directions and between a variety of \ndualisms (Maldonado Ruiz, 2010: 84, 86) and the social significance of communal land \ntenure and the harvest. Each of these elements invoke necessary communal and ritual ties \nbetween human bodies, spirits, and fea tures of the immediately apparent physical \nenvironment such as mountains, rivers and stars (Andrade, 1999). These relations are \nencapsulated by Christine Greenway as \u2018the geographical embodiment of spiritual forces \nand the spiritual embodiment of social fo rces\u2019, thereby leading each person to be \nenmeshed \u2018in hierarchical and egalitarian social webs that require reciprocal exchanges of \ngoods, labour and ritual activities\u2019 (1998: 993). This can be contrasted with the minimal \nimportance of communal and spiritu al obligations between human and non -human \nentities in the individualist traditional Jivaroan societies; the relative absence of communal \nforms of religiosity and ritual; and the \u2018remarkable indifference\u2019 to the past and the \npassage of time of these \u2018amnes iac\u2019 peoples (Descola, 1996: 223, 225).   \nIn particular, the contrast between the relative communality of Kichwa culture and the \nrelative individualism of Jivaroan culture (e.g. Descola, 1996: 138, 223) makes the notion of \nan \u2018indigenous\u2019 governmentality t hat attempts to represent both highly problematic. The \nprovincial government of Zamora -Chinchipe is headed by Salvador Quishpe, a Saraguro -\nKichwa man whose family runs the largest store in Zamora, selling hardware and \nconstruction materials obtained from m anufacturers in the Ecuadorian highlands and \ninternationally. His government has instituted a project of development lending to 275 \n indigenous groups, which is oriented specifically toward financing the set -up of cacao or \ncoffee farming. The caveat of this sti mulus, however, is that it is expected to be contracted \nto communities as a whole, and not to budding individual entrepreneurs. During my time \nin Yanua, I was continually pestered to make extravagant loans, or procure them from the \nmysterious international  sources which, as a white man, I was presumed to have at my \ndisposal. I would often reply to this that surely support must be readily forthcoming from \nthe PK -run provincial government. The \u2018s\u00edndico\u2019 of Yanua dismissed the possibility by \nexplaining the afo rementioned communitarian ideals guiding PK government lending. \n\u2018The Shuar are not like this,\u2019 he said. \u2018I am not going to work all day for another man\u2019s \nbenefit.\u2019 The point was echoed by another man from Yanua: \u2018Everyone here has to work \nfor himself. Here , we don\u2019t work united. Each one works individually.\u2019 These men\u2019s \nassertions match the impressions of Descola and Taylor four decades ago when they \nremarked on a neighbouring Jivaroan group that \u2018the Achuar have clearly never heard of \nprimitive communism\u2019 (Descola, 1996: 41). Indeed, an Oxfam -sponsored study found that \ncommunally run commercial development operations have typically not been viable in \nindigenous Amazonian communities, pointing out that \u2018community is a social form of \norganisation structured a s a political strategy to defend the land,\u2019 rather than an \nindigenous form of political organisation (Smith, 1996: 238 -9). These collectivist ideas \nabout the significance of indigeneity for development and structures of social and political \norganisation ar e widely disseminated by Pachakutik\u2019s political leaders and collide with \nmany of the assumptions to be found within the cultural inheritance of Shuar people. As \nsuch, it is unsurprising that Shuar people have adopted a variety of positionings with \nrespect to indigeneity, seeking to interpret it within a historical context of colonial \nresistance, taking up different aspects of its meaning depending on their institutional and 276 \n class positions, or at other times avoiding association with the identity or explici tly \nrejecting its relevance to their present -day lives.  \nFigure 13: Zamora -Chinchipe provincial government sign explaining a nearby construction \nproject: the lower section reads, \u2018We are moving forward \u201cen minga\u201d for development\u2019; \n\u2018minga\u2019 is a term of Kich wa origin meaning \u2018collective work project\u2019.  \n \nThese distinct deployments of the discourse of indigeneity by Shuar people in Zamora -\nChinchipe contrast markedly with the often blithe celebrations by non -indigenous people \nof the liberatory and empowering pot ential of indigeneity as a discourse and identity. \nWhile anthropologists should be expected to pay supreme attention to the specificities of \ncultural difference and strictly avoid reinforcing the cheap tropes of indigeneity that \nproliferate in popular cult ure, contemporary Andean and Amazonian anthropology \nsuggests that anthropologists\u2019 professional credibility remains bound up with idealised \nexpressions of indigeneity. Gabriela Valdivia, for instance, criticises Juliet Erazo\u2019s work for \n277 \n relying on too many \u2018western\u2019 precepts \u2013such as sovereignty, property, governance, etc. \u2013\nin pursuing her aim of producing \u2018situated knowledges of how indigenous peoples form \nand defend connections to the land\u2019 (Valdivia, 2015: 602). In essence, then, she is arguing \nthat \u2018situat ed\u2019 indigenous knowledge should not include western precepts, even when the \nindigenous group in question \u2013Kichwa Amazonians \u2013have a long history of acting \nintermediaries between western Amazonia and the Andes (Taylor, 1999: 238; Whitten, \n1976). This criticis m is despite the fact that a central theme of Erazo\u2019s work is the use of \nstrategic essentialism in indigenous governmentality and their engagements with \ninternational donors (e.g. Erazo, 2010: 1018). In fact, Kichwa Amazonians\u2019 manipulation of \nNorth -Atlant ic tropes of ideal indigeneity, it could be argued, is a post -modern \nreformulation of their people\u2019s historic role as traffickers of various forms of capital \nbetween indigenous Amazonia and the capitalist world -system.  \nIn other works, the desire to put for th an activist anthropology that advocates for \nindigenous peoples completely confuses the analysis of indigenous peoples\u2019 own \napplication of the discourse of indigeneity. Nicole Fabricant, for example, sets out to \ndocument \u2018the use of Andean historical mem ory as a cultural resource for political change\u2019 \n(2010: 89) in landless workers\u2019 activism in Bolivia, focusing on \u2018ayllu\u201971 rhetoric as \u2018a \nspectacle -driven, discursive and rights -based cultural heritage resource\u2019 (2010: 94). \nHowever, in her enthusiasm to su pport activists\u2019 \u2018creative reassembly of parts of their \nAndean prehistory\u2019 (2010: 95), Fabricant ends up allowing a noticeable degree of creative \nlicense in her own writing. At various points, she refers uncritically to \u2018ancient Andean \ncommunities\u2019 (2010: 90), \u2018ancient structures\u2019 of \u2018reciprocity and redistribution\u2019 (2010: 98), \n                                                        \n71 \u2018Ayllu\u2019 is a Quechua and Aymara term referring to an extended family -centred community that owns, \nworks and harvests land communally.  278 \n \u2018Andean ideals regarding social obligations\u2019 (2010: 95) and \u2018older ways of buying and selling \nland\u2019 (2010: 103). Rather than using her skills and networks as an anthropologist to cla rify \nthe nature of the original referents being deployed by Bolivian landless workers \u2013and \nperhaps highlighting their transformations in the process \u2013Fabricant instead opts for an \nentirely discursive focus that ends up simply absorbing and repeating much of the \nmovement\u2019s rhetoric.  \nA similar critique could be directed at the work of Jean Jackson and Mar\u00eda Ram\u00edrez (2009). \nThese authors celebrate the Colombian Yanacona\u2019s \u2018reindigenization\u2019 campaign, calling it \n\u2018an extraordinary example of a community creativel y engaging \u201cthe slippages, dispersions, \nand ambivalences of discursive and moral formations\u201d\u2019 (2009: 537), citing Povinelli here \n(2002: 29). They also praise the group\u2019s success in playing up to the terms defined by \ninternational donors, which they refer t o as \u2018a community\u2019s ability to articulate its interests \nand values in optimal fashion to powerful individuals and institutions\u2019 (2009: 537). In so \ndoing, however, they overlook the manner in which the discourse of cultural rights \ncircumscribes campaigns fo r collective rights on ethnic grounds in ways that, even in the \nsmall theatre relevant to the Yanacona example, appear to harm the interests of both non -\nindigenous poor farmers (2009: 536) and local townspeople (2009: 529). Following their \nsuccessful reind igenization campaign, Yanacona people were settled near the source of \nthe river that provides drinking water to the town of San August\u00edn, meaning that the water \nflowing into the town became polluted. Although it recognises indigenous communal land \ntitle, t he neoliberal -multicultural Colombian state does not recognise free drinking water \nas a general collective right. Yanacona empowerment, in other words, clearly came at the \ncost of neighbouring mestizos. In their support for the Yanacona, Jackson and Ram\u00edre z \ndemonstrate no reflection on their own role in international structures of power, 279 \n particularly the way their reproduction of the social capital of indigeneity perpetuates an \nunderstanding of legitimate collective political action that is dependent on eth no-cultural \nidentity to the detriment of broader collective struggles, in Colombia and elsewhere.  \nIn all of these cases, anthropologists have gone out of their way to celebrate indigenous \nagency in reworking and redefining indigenous rights discourse, pain ting an \noverwhelmingly positive picture of indigenous peoples\u2019 invocations of idealised \nexpressions of indigeneity. There seems to be very little recognition in the extant literature \nof either the multiple ways the discourses of indigeneity may be employed  within the same \nindigenous group; the potential for idealised imagery of indigeneity to alienate indigenous \npeople from a sense of their own indigeneity72 (see Chapter 6); or the deeper question of \nthe desirability of the delimitation of collective rights to the criteria of culture and \nethnicity. In this final sense, a greater degree of reflexivity regarding anthropologists\u2019 role \nas authorisers of indigenous cultural legitimacy in forums of state and international law \nseems advisable, as this would imply at tention to the global context of cosmopolitan \npower in which anthropology doubtless maintains a functional place.  \n \nCulture as a History of Cumulatively Developed Conceptual Complexity  \nAlthough CONAIE has roots in indigenous collaborations with socialist parties, particularly \nin the highlands (Becker, 2008), and with missionaries, particularly in the Amazon \n(Rubenstein, 2001: 278), it has also risen to prominence within the context of a global trend \n                                                        \n72 I was regularly told by Shuar people, even those who are entirely ethnically Shuar and live on indigenous \ncommunally -titled territory, that they are \u2018me dio mestizos ya,\u2019 because they do not identify themselves \nwith indigeneity as embodied in its idealised form by isolated forest peoples and by their own ancestors.  280 \n of international institutional support for valorising cultural difference and linking cultural \nrights to territory, a phenomenon eloquently documented by Charles Hale (2011: 186, 191). \nThus, when Amazonian activists, political representatives and everyday individuals express \nthe discourse characteristic of Pachakutik and global indigenous rights, they are not \nexpressing an isolated affirmation of their own history, culture or identity; they are also \nexpressing themselves within a global institu tional context that reinforces tropes of an \nindigeneity defined by environmentalism (Conklin & Graham, 1995; Hames, 2007), \nshamanism (Conklin, 2002), and \u2018hyper -real\u2019 cultural manifestations (Ramos, 1994). One \nmight tentatively suspect that this discursive  shift emanating from cosmopolitan centres \nof power toward a new esteem for indigenous cultures might, as it filters outward, \ncontribute toward a greater degree of pride and recognition for their own particular \nlifeways among indigenous peoples. To a small  extent, this expectation is borne out by the \ndata on medicinal plant usage among Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe.  \nHowever, when these people spoke about health -seeking practices and their attendant \nontologies, not all of them invoked a sense of themselve s as indigenous people in \nformulating their responses. Among those who did, however, as we saw in Chapter 3, \nthere was no greater preference toward shamanism and visionary \u2018spiritual\u2019 practices, in \nspite of the slightly greater preference for medicinal pla nts over clinical medicine. The \nconclusion thereby suggested \u2013that indigenous rights discourse as a cultural vector is \nmultivalent, has no specific directionality or impact, but rather is taken up and deployed in \na variety of disjointed ways, while being ig nored by many of the people most immersed in \nancestral ways of life \u2013has been confirmed in this chapter, at least within the small arena \nof the study, through an analysis of the discourse of indigeneity that brought colour and \ndepth to the statistical trans parency of Chapter 3. Indigeneity was invoked, particularly in 281 \n the remote region of Nangaritza, as an idiom of historical consciousness and resistance to \nwhat was perceived as an ongoing colonial encounter with the Ecuadorian state. To speak \nabout indigeno us identity in this sense stimulated productive critique of state institutions \nas well as encouraging outright rejection of all facets of mestizo society and validation of \nelements of traditional society.  \nOther Shuar people spoke of indigeneity as \u2018cultur e\u2019, a discursive frame which, far from \ninvoking indigenous resistance, allows for the easy categorisation of Shuar people within \nthe worldview of non -indigenous people in terms of the minimalist celebration of cultural \ndiversity implied by neoliberal multi culturalism (Hale, 2002; \u017di\u017eek, 1997). Similarly, elder \nmen who controlled large tracts of land invoked their indigeneity as validation of their \ncapacity for environmental stewardship. Like those who invoked the value of \u2018culture\u2019, \nthese men spoke in terms  that have been formulated by and justify the marginal \nindigenous presence within the neoliberal multicultural system. For others, the lack of \nrelevance of the discourse of indigeneity catalysed the impact of modernist \nsubjectification73 associated with tec hnological and material progress and defined against \nidealised expressions of indigeneity. In this, I suggest, the applications of the notion of \nindigenous identity on the part of influential outside groups may have caused Shuar \npeople\u2019s alienation from id entification with indigeneity, whether these groups were \npoliticians promoting a Kichwa expression of governmentality or anthropologists \nvalidating \u2018hyper -real\u2019 celebratory ideals of indigenous identity.  \n                                                        \n73 Assujetissment , following the same definition as Judith Butler (1997: 84, 90), though she  prefers the \ntranslation \u2018subjection.\u2019  282 \n While I have here sought to take the politically con tentious step of temporarily adopting a \n\u2018metadiscursive\u2019 subject position (see Briggs, 1996: 439) vis -\u00e0-vis the discourse of \nindigeneity, the study as a whole is very much implicated in the topic at hand in this \nchapter. To conclude that notions of indigen ous culture and identity contain multivalent \npossibilities necessarily begs the questions as to which of these are embodied in this very \nresearch project. If one accepts an ontological definition of culture74 and its implications \nfor the intercultural, whic h is effectively a sine qua non  for serious consideration of the \npresent study, I argue that one should also take a historicist perspective on (indigenous) \nculture. This is not ordinarily the perception of the (neo)structuralism represented by the \n\u2018narrow ontological turn\u2019 (Kohn, 2015: 316), which has been subject to now familiar \ncriticisms regarding the \u2018flattening\u2019 of indigenous diversity by theory, the denial of \ncoevalness in representation of indigenous people and the obviation of the contemporary \npolit ical emergencies they face (Ramos, 2012: 481, 483, 486). Yet there is no reason why \nthe study of the range of human conceptualisations of the nature of reality needs to be \npursued in an ahistorical, structuralist way; and no reason why its study should not  make \nreference to the external religious, economic and political -discursive forces that I have \ntermed cultural vectors and the changes they impact upon the ontology in question. \nCulture thus understood is not a phenomenon to be automatically esteemed in t he liberal \nsense by which the capacity for \u2018tolerance\u2019 and \u2018inclusion\u2019 of external cultures is a mark of \npride in ourselves (e.g. Rorty, 1991: 204). Culture should instead be esteemed by \nrecognising it as a historically produced system of conceptual comple xity to which degrees \nof sophistication can only be added slowly and cumulatively. This in turn means \n                                                        \n74 Contra a definition that accepts the modern, naturalist distinction between nature and culture and thus \nthe differentiation between scientific facts about nature versus the culturally -specific beliefs of non -\nmodern others.  283 \n acknowledging that culture can only develop over long, continuous historical periods in \nwhich ongoing intra - and inter -group communication is permitted by  material conditions \nof economic sustenance and relative peace. Conversely, centuries of culture can be rapidly \ndestroyed by the violence, disease and dislocation inherent to colonialism, which remains \nin living memory for many Shuar people. In fact, some would argue that it never ceased.  \nThe knowledge practices that Shuar people turn to based on their health -seeking \npreferences are themselves dependent on cultures as systems of conceptual complexity. \nThis includes both the medical science that had been in gestation during the period of \ncivilisational continuity referred to as modern Europe and which developed rapidly with \nthe material abundance of the post -war era in the twentieth century; as well as the \nautochthonous Amazonian practices of healing, sociali sation and self -development \nrepresented by herbal, shamanic and visionary practices. These knowledge practices are \nlikely themselves the legacy of the populous riverine trading peoples of the Upper Amazon \n(e.g. Porro, 1994), and perhaps especially those of  the Ucayali, who were not subjugated \nuntil the late nineteenth century (see Santos -Granero, 2009: 22 -25), or of the urban \npeoples of the Amazon River proper, who were much more numerous but whose \ncivilisation collapsed sooner after European contact. For t hese latter peoples, \narchaeologist Anna Roosevelt argues that there is \u2018indisputable evidence of large -scale, \nvery populous regional societies comparable to complex chiefdoms and small states \nknown in other parts of the world\u2019 (1993: 260). Or, in the words  of Claude L\u00e9vi -Strauss:  \nThere [in Amazonia], where we believed to have found the last evidence of archaic lifeways \nand modes of thought, we now recognise the survivors of complex and powerful societies, \nengaged in a historical process for millennia, and which have become disintegrated in the 284 \n lapse of two or three centuries, a tragic accident, itself historical, which the discovery of the \nNew World was for them (1993: 9).  \nThis \u2018historicist\u2019 conception of knowledge practices and their attendant ontologies \nfacilitates the comparison of systems of knowledge. It frees us from the obligation to \nsomehow perceive and assess knowledge systems as more or less accurate \nrepresentations of reality, instead allowing us to visualise knowledge practices as \nhistorically co ntingent upon particular socio -cultural experiences. By helping to explain \nwhen and how particular knowledge practices were developed, such a mode of analysis \nchanges the question of comparison from one of better and worse, to one of \nrecognising the partic ularities of each system and asking who such practices might be \ngood for today. An intercultural state would allow Shuar people the institutional space \nand autonomy to answer that question for themselves, as well as bringing the benefits \nof epistemic plura lism to the broader society.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 285 \n Chapter 8: Final Thoughts  \n \nThe Difference between Valuing Culture and Valuing Knowledge  \nTo briefly recap: this thesis has advocated for a radical interpretation of state \ninterculturality that draws out the most fundamen tal epistemological and ontological \nimplications of pluralising the cultural foundations of the state. It argued that biomedical \nepistemology cannot rightly be seen as a neutral, universal arbiter of the efficacy and \nsuitability of health -seeking practices  across cultural contexts. Its implication with the \neconomic, legal and regulatory structures whose roots lie in the historical development of \nthe industrial mass societies of the North -Atlantic world mean that its assumptions about \nthe nature and producti on of medicines have come to appear arbitrary in the light of the \ncross -cultural encounter. Such a position can be viewed as an attack on biomedicine only \nby its most partisan backers, for the claim touches on biomedicine\u2019s universalising \npretensions rathe r than on the evident complexity of its knowledge base and its \nsophisticated interventional capacities in health crises. Indeed, biomedicine\u2019s flaws are \noften of a piece with its benefits, especially notable amongst these being the ability to \ncheaply mass -produce and distribute medications worldwide (corporate attempts at \nintellectual property monopolisation notwithstanding).  \nIf biomedicine is prof oundly implicated in the socio -historical experience of Western \nEurope and North America , it cannot be p resumed as the standard for knowledge and \npractice in healing in Latin America. How then to assess a culture\u2019s healing practices \nwithout deferring to any one set of epistemological and ontological assumptions? The \nproject of placing the focus on popular kn owledge in the cultural and epistemic 286 \n borderlands has its origins in this question. And indeed, where biomedicine arrives and is \nexperienced in a context of colonial difference, as for example in Shuar territory in Alto \nNangaritza in the far south -east of Ecuador, this \u2018border knowledge\u2019 approach \ndemonstrates clear potential to assess healing practices in relation to one another, and to \nopen up new conceptualisations of illness and new approaches to healing. This ranges \nfrom new materia medica \u2013one thinks es pecially of the datura plasters shown in this \nresearch to be widely used for breaks, sprains and other injuries \u2013to the insistence among \nthose Shuar committed to an ancestral ontology that health is not a normal state \ncontradistinguished from illness. Inste ad, it is understood as a point on a continuum that \nranges from weakness and marginalisation to strength and prosperity, demanding a life of \npurpose, self -development and self -knowledge \u2013\u2018the unfurling of the personality,\u2019 in the \nwords of the shaman C\u00e9sar S antiak \u2013as well as harmonious socialisation with respect to \none\u2019s family, neighbours and non -human environment, and steadfastness with respect to \none\u2019s enemies.  \nFrom a western perspective, the implications of this epistemology and ontology of health \nare fa r-reaching, suggesting new approaches to therapy, adolescent development and the \naetiology of chronic illness as rooted in the particularities of individuals\u2019 personalities, life \ntrajectories and marginalised social positions. Indeed, the engagement with a yahuasca \nalone has encouraged so -called \u2018bio -psycho -social\u2019 approaches to diagnosis and treatment \n(Re, Palma, Martin & Sim\u00f5es, 2016: 238) and has influenced such thinkers as Gabor Mat\u00e9, \nwho has linked conditions such as asthma and addiction to insecure chi ldhood \nattachments and emotional trauma (2011: 277). These impacts, moreover, have occurred \nwithout any systematic effort to invite collaboration with indigenous practitioners or to \nprovide material support for the further development of their knowledge sy stems, which 287 \n is both their right as citizens of intercultural states and would also be but a small \ncompensation for the  historical and ongoing extraction of natural resources from \nindigenous lands.  \nDespite demonstrating these points, judged in the light of its initial intentions this project \nhas had mixed success. Taking a popular knowledge approach to uncover a group of \npeople\u2019s healthcare preferences in a way that goes beyond privileging any one health -\nseeking epistemology \u2013and thereby finding out the co mposition of the set of health -\nseeking preferences of which the intercultural state should be representative \u2013is evidently \nless simple than was originally proposed. The primary reason for this was the subtle \nconceptual implication of indigeneity as a space exterior to modernity and the western \nnation -state system, a methodological flaw in the \u2018border knowledge\u2019 approach that had \nramifications throughout the thesis and in fact became its central problematic toward the \nend of Chapter 5, and in Chapter 6 in par ticular.  \nShuar Evangelicals, a significant minority within the Shuar population, have a distinct and \nvery particular set of health -seeking preferences based on their own interpretation of the \nontological and epistemological assumptions transmitted to them  by Evangelical \nmissionaries and their own ancestors. Yet the group cannot be viewed as a discrete culture \nwith an independently developed body of health -seeking knowledge and practice. Rather, \ntheir preferences in healthcare for the most part resembled a materialist position, with a \ncentral place granted to the natural laws of the ordinary plane of reality, alongside passive \nsupplication before the higher powers experienced during non -ordinary states of \nconsciousness. Their morally charged monotheism, in s hort, resulted in a progression \ntoward the philosophical materialism of modernist ontology.  288 \n Consequently, the Evangelical cohort of interviewees prompted a further methodological \nconsideration related to the (lack of) neutrality of the term epistemology it self. The \ngroup\u2019s generalised rejection of practices that they knew to be efficacious highlighted the \ncultural specificity of presuming a commitment to what is known to be true. The \nEvangelical epistemology is moralised; in that sense, it could be argued t hat it is not an \nepistemology at all. Consequently, the Evangelical Shuar sub -culture brings into question \nthe notion that there is an empiricism native to the human condition, and which is \ntherefore inherently present in traditions of healing in a manner that would signify their \nuniversal value and relevance, as was claimed by the ethnobotanists who led the ICBG \nAguaruna and the ICBG Maya (see Chapter 1). While the non -Evangelical, non -working -\nclass Shuar introduced in Chapter 4 share our own commitment to  seeking a prosperous, \nhealthy and happy existence in the bodies and lives in which we find ourselves, Evangelical \nShuar did not demonstrate this concern with living out their lives effectively in the here \nand now of this earth. Instead, their primary conc ern is the avoidance of sin, with the \npursuit of health and the vanquishing of illness as the subordinate goal. Although the latter \nis explicitly dependent on the former, as illness is said to be the result of sin, Evangelicals \ndo not deny that the traditi onal Shuar healing practices they regard as sinful and avoid do \nalso serve to heal the sick. The applicability of the \u2018border knowledge\u2019 approach of \nuncovering \u2018localised accounts of best epistemic practices\u2019 (Alcoff, 2007: 97) thus begins \nto fall apart, for it presumes a relationship between truth and practice or knowledge and \npractice which is neither universal nor exclusive to the western secular subject. Although \nShuar people were often drawn to Evangelism because of flaws in ancestral health -seeking \nknowledge practice, their continued adherence to the religion was not based on any \nsuggestion of epistemic primacy, but on its proclaimed moral superiority.  289 \n The case of Shuar waged labourers was distinct, yet had a similar impact with regard to \nthis project\u2019s initial methodological proposals. Waged miners in the Quimi Valley dismissed \nshamanic healing and ancestral visionary practices, in spite of the successful experience of \nmany Shuar people in the region with healing via this modality. Again, as in  Chapter 5, their \nrejection of these practices was not based on the claim that shamanic and visionary \npractice was fraudulent or ineffective, as one would conclude when presuming a neutral \nepistemology on their part. Instead, their rejection of such practi ces was based on its \nperceived lack of relevance to their contemporary position vis -\u00e0-vis Amazonian indigeneity \nand ancestral culture. In a striking reflection of antiquated tropes from the history of the \ndiscipline of anthropology itself, these indigenous  Amazonians could only understand \nshamanic and visionary practices as relevant in combination with a stance of exoticising \ntemporal, geographic or ethnic distance toward such practices. Additionally, the use of \nmedicinal plants was greatly dependent on cla ss considerations; that meant, in this \ncontext, access to and ownership of land. Those working -class Shuar who were not \nregularly immersed in a biodiverse environment during their daily productive activities \ndemonstrably preferred clientelistic engagement with clinical medical services in a manner \nmore similar to mestizo Ecuadorians than to fellow Shuar people with different geographic \nand class positionings. In sum, even indigenous Amazonians seemingly on the furthest \nmargins of the world -system are clearl y cross -cut in a cultural sense by transnational forces \nthat shape their morality, subjectivity, ontological commitments and everyday economic \nactivity.  \nReflecting on these points from Chapters 5 and 6, one is drawn to conclude that the central \nplace grant ed to epistemology as the means to articulating a true and accurate worldview \nis itself a modernist -specific preoccupation. With not just the popular knowledge 290 \n methodology of this thesis but in cultural analysis more broadly, we assume that \nindividuals hav e an innate drive to learn about the world through their experiences and to \nmaintain coherence in the way they understand it. Yet based on the testimonies of those \nShuar people influenced by Protestant Evangelism and waged labour regimes on the \nborderlands  between ontologies, the assumption is not borne out. They tend, instead, to \nsee certain ontologies not as inaccurate or unbelievable but as morally wrong, or as \nimpossible to reconcile with their identity investments, subjectification or social \npositionin g. For Evangelicals, the concern with the afterlife distorts the implicit \nunderstanding \u2013shared by the secular west and ancestral Shuar culture \u2013that the purpose \nof knowledge is to manifest tangible outcomes on the material plane of reality. For waged \nminers , we might speculate that their inability to reconcile ancestral health -seeking \npractices with a modernist enjoyment of the spoils of economic progress vindicates Judith \nButler\u2019s proposition that \u2018identification is the resolution of desire\u2019 (1997: 102), fo r clearly \nthey sense that an artific ial \u2018choice\u2019 has been made between material prosperity and \nancestral knowledge and practice.  \nNone of this analysis would have been possible if not for the degree to which the lives of \nShuar people in Alto Nangaritza (and occasionally elsewhere, as with those Shuar who \ncontrolled significant amounts of land in the Quimi Valley) approximated the ana lytical \nframework of exteriority to coloniality presumed in the \u2018border thinking\u2019 of Walter \nMignolo and Linda Alcoff . The ethnography of this region thereby facilitated comparison \nwith those sectors of the Shuar population whose health -seeking preferenc es and \nfundamental ontological commitments were predominately shaped by the effect of \ntransnational cultural vectors. This is not to suggest that Alto Nangaritza Shuar represent \na static, authentic manifestation of the culture of the Shuar nationality. As we saw in 291 \n Chapter 4, Alto Nangaritza Shuar people\u2019s comprehension of illness and modes of \nredressing it draw on the mestizo Ecuadorian conceptual vocabulary of envy, with its roots \nin Hispanic and Mediterranean folk aetiology, as well as drawing on the ima gery of modern \nweaponry, just as their ancestors employed the metaphoric repertoire of warfare as it \nexisted in their own era. Having said that, the region\u2019s cultural trajectory can be \ncharacterised as one of continuity and adaptation, rather than of sudde n breakages in the \ntransmission of knowledge \u2013as appears to be occurring in the Quimi River Valley \u2013or \nforceful ethical condemnations of ancestral practices \u2013as is evident among Evangelical \nShuar.  \nHow can we account for the fact that from a western perspecti ve, there appears to be \nobviously more value in the epistemological and ontological engagement with Shuar \npeople in Alto Nangaritza than with Evangelical and working -class Shuar people? Part of \nthe answer lies in the fact that these two latter groups are s o influenced by the same \ncultural vectors that have shaped the western world. As such, their health -seeking \npractices and general outlook on life are for the most part easily recognisable, even if these \ngroups\u2019 relationship with the Shuar cultural inherita nce is complex. It would seem that \nShuar waged miners can contribute little in the way of new approaches to knowledge \nproduction, except to the extent that their economic activity works to build up centres of \npolitical -economic gravity and their associated  centres of knowledge production in \nEcuador and elsewhere. Likewise, Protestant Evangelical Shuar preach a worldview of \nmaterialism governed by natural (divinely ordained) laws that was of a piece with that of \nProtestant northern Europe until just a few de cades ago. In this light, the value of cultural \ndiversity in the sense of ontological difference and epistemic pluralism does signify valuing \nexteriority as implied by the term \u2018colonial difference.\u2019 This exteriority is not necessarily 292 \n geographic, as in th e case of isolated Amazonian indigenous peoples; with reference to \nthe Ecuadorian context, it also recalls Andean Kichwa communities with long histories of \nautonomous organisation. I am therefore suggesting that it is not to indigenous ethnicity \nper se tha t interculturality owes its responsiveness. It is this distinct socio -historical \nexperience of many of Latin America\u2019s indigenous peoples during which layers and layers \nof conceptual complexity have been successively added to their healing and other \nknowle dge practices wherein lies the greatest potential for intercultural collaboration. The \ncaveat here is revealed by the Evangelicals: the value of epistemic pluralism is dependent \non a common agreement between cultures \u2013an \u2018intercultural common -ground,\u2019 if yo u will \u2013\nthat knowledge should inform and evaluate practice based on its implications in this life, \nand not in heaven, the wheel of karma, or elsewhere.  \n \nThe Culture of the State in Ecuador and Beyond  \nAn assumption made in this thesis that readers may have found unduly optimistic relates \nto the supposed pliability of the state; in other words, the notion that the state is \nsufficiently empty of fixed qualities for the goal of culturally representative state \ninstitutions in a country as diverse as Ecuador to b e a possibility. Are states so wedded to \nprojects of bureaucratic normalisation that they are incapable of culturally specific \nmodulations in different locations throughout their own territory? To what extent might \nthe implicit rationalities of states impi nge upon or enhance the liberatory epistemic \npotential of interculturality? For advocates of the intercultural state, this question opens \nup a complementary line of investigation to the work of social and cultural anthropology \nthat this thesis has for the most part pursued. It takes ethnography on a terrain of 293 \n significant cultural difference to comprehend the fullest implications of state \ninterculturality; but the study of the way the Ecuadorian state and others might respond \nto the call for ontological and  epistemological pluralism would seem to requires an \ninstitutional ethnography that is beyond the scope of this research. In lieu of venturing any \ngrander propositions on the potential of states in general to become intercultural, I offer \nsome observations on the prospects for state interculturality at the close of the Correa \npresidency.  \nFor institutions of the state to be representative of the cultures \u2013and those cultures\u2019 \nsystems of knowledge \u2013in their vicinity, they would need to be headed not by specialis ts in \n\u2018cultural competency\u2019 but by recognised experts in specific fields of knowledge within the \ncultural group in question. This would mean, for example, that Shuar people would \ndevelop the state\u2019s policies in the fields of health, education, justice, and  so on, for state \ninstitutions operating on Shuar territory. As discussed in Chapter 1,  however, th e Alianza \nPa\u00eds national government is centralist in character and has demonstrated a willingness to \ncompete with Pachakutik and other political parties for control of the various institutional \napparatus of the state.  Clearly then,  AP is unlikely  to hand over control of branches of state \nministries that it perceives as its own to PK -affiliated indigenous organisations. Yet as we \nhave seen, in Shuar territory in Zamora -Chinchipe the PK -affiliated communities were \nprecisely those for whom an intercultural state\u2019s support for epistemic pluralism would be \nmost meaningful.  \nThe way around this impasse would seem to be for the relevant state competencies to \ndefer to indigenous associations of educators, healers and law/loremen and women in  a \nmanner that treats them as providers of technical expertise. These associations would 294 \n then engage in permanent dialogue with state functionaries dealing with budgeting, \ncontracting and other administrative considerations. Indeed, as fashionable as it is  to be \npessimistic with regard to the state, some highly conceptually sophisticated comments \nforthcoming from Fernando Calder\u00f3n, Ecuador\u2019s former Director of Intercultural Health (a \nbody under the Ministry of Public Health), suggest that such a policy may be politically \nfeasible. Pointing to the work ahead in supporting indigenous health -seeking practices, \nthe Director pointed to the development of \u2018legal and regulatory mechanisms that would \npermit its practitioners to be sponsored,\u2019 including \u2018their regist ration and certification \n[and] the development of appropriate technologies\u2019 (Calder\u00f3n, 2010: 57). As with any \nprofession, practitioners would need to be certified not according to the norms of the \nstate, but by their own associations. The Director went on to emphasise that \u2018[t]his will \nnot only extend conventional epidemiological profiles, but also broaden explicative \nmodels of health -illness\u2019 (2010: 56). In other words, there is an evident understanding that \nthe principle of intercultural health is concept ually enriching, rather than simply an \nopportunity to facilitate the expansion of public health programs in their current form. The \nDirector went on to stress that it is \u2018our ethical obligation to preserve and sustainably \ndevelop [indigenous health practit ioners\u2019] sacred spaces, knowledges, technologies and \npractices, working to consolidate their declaration as the living cultural patrimony of the \nhumanity of the future\u2019 (2010: 56, my emphasis). The notion of \u2018patrimony,\u2019 in particular, \nresonates with a his toricist view of culture as accumulated conceptual complexity, which \nI have argued is most responsive to the value of epistemological and ontological diversity \nimplicit to interculturality. In light of these statements, the problem perhaps lies less with \nany specific obstacle than with the inevitable institutional inertia when faced with the \nscope and ambition of such a task.  295 \n Critiquing Liberal Multiculturalism Post -2016  \nThis thesis is largely a critique of the conceptualisations of the state and culture i n liberal \nmulticulturalism; as well as the way that its subtle Eurocentrism has facilitated its uptake \nas the political philosophy of choice for Latin American states that have done little to \ndecolonise and become culturally representative. However, the cl ose analytical \nattendance to and emphasis on cultural peculiarities required by the principle of state \ninterculturality is typically considered suspect not only by liberals but also by Marxists, who \nare wary that such critiques of liberal humanism may embo lden the ethno -nationalist right. \nIndeed, the invocation of the rights of \u2018indigenous Britons\u2019 by the likes of Nigel Farage \n(Morris, 2014) is, post -Brexit, no longer a laughing matter. Yet the reality is that those \ncultural groups that Marxists are wary of  further empowering are not in need of a \ndiscourse of interculturality founded on the principle of the cultural representativeness of \nthe state, as the intersecting privileges of white male supremacy mean that such groups \nalready enjoy the option of cultur ally specific private institutions. Consideration of the \nincredibly well -resourced Mormon institution Brigham Young University in Utah would \nsuggest that the enjoyment of culturally appropriate institutions in fields such as education \nand other arenas esse ntial to social reproduction is currently itself a class privilege. \nMeanwhile, on a global level, migrant, indigenous and African -descended populations are \nnot typically in a position to be able to establish and benefit from such private institutions, \nfind ing themselves instead policed, socialised and cared for according to the logic of \nputatively rational, \u2018post -cultural\u2019 state policies which allay these groups\u2019 distinctiveness \nin the name of a universality that is generally a veiled Eurocentrism. It is in  this \nintersectional sense that state interculturality is not just a pluralist position, but also a \nMarxist one.  296 \n Yet while the ethno -nationalist backlash need not make multicultural liberals of us all, it \nshould alert us to the dangers of an intellectual s ectarianism the equivalent of the political \nsectarianism that led some progressively minded US citizens to focus their criticisms on \nHillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race. For indigenous health practitioners and \nfor economically and linguistica lly marginalised indigenous individuals who get sick, there \nare far worse things than a free healthcare service whose doctors have only basic cross -\ncultural competency training. Racism and a lazy neglect toward indigenous people are still \ncommon in Ecuador ian clinics and hospitals, and a fear borne of lack of access to medical \ntech nology still inflects Amazonian peoples \u2019 engagement with the public health system \n(Aguirre, 2016: 19 -21). Sometimes the fear goes both ways: in April 2014, a Huaorani family \nreportedly brought a dead relative to a remote clinic in Pastaza province. The group \nresponded with rage at the clinicians \u2019 refusal to treat the dead body and went on to spear \ntwo Ecuadorian government development workers to death (El Universo, 2014). Two years \nafter Fernando Calder\u00f3n was outlining the potential for intercultural health in Ecuador, \nPeru\u2019s Vice -Minister of Int erculturality announced that over the preceding year and a half, \neighteen shamans had been murdered in the northern Amazonian district of Balsa Puerto, \nallegedly by Protestant Evangelicals rabidly opposed to the practice of shamanism \n(Agencia Efe, 2011).  \nNonetheless, the obvious threats to even basic liberal advances should not make us \ncontent to set our sights on small goals. As is now very evident on the political level, \nremaining perpetually on the defensive against parochial, partisan aggression eventua lly \nerodes progressives\u2019 capacity to make substantive policy proposals. To regard political \nmovements such as that underway in Ecuador with hope and seek to add positive \nintercultural policy contributions to their endeavours is by no means a denial of the present 297 \n global challenges to even a minimalist, multicultural political program. One evening in \nShaime, after the conversation had lingered a brief while lamenting the loss of ancestral \npractice among Shuar Evangelicals, a local man remarked, \u2018Between us w e can also arrive \nat a condemnation of ourselves, of how we allowed this person [the Evangelical] to wane \nso much, when this person is a part of myself as well.\u2019 In the broadest historical sense, the \nambitious goals of institutional autonomy for those indi genous peoples who seek it may \nultimately be the catalyst for colonial societies to evolve beyond the fear and ignorance \nthat both feeds base discrimination while also keeping our eyes closed to the value of the \nontological and epistemological difference c ontained in such cultures. Explaining the \nadvantages of state interculturality in such terms is likely a more productive strategy than \ncontinuing to make intellectual condemnations of racism and ignorance, which after all \nhave no need of an intellectual fo undation in order to thrive . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 298 \n References  \n \nAcosta, Alberto (2013), \u2018Corre\u00edsmo: El nuevo modelo de dominaci\u00f3n burguesa\u2019, Sin \nPermiso , 1\u201314.  \nAcosta, Alberto, et al.
