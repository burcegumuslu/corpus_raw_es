The \ndocuments at the Archivo General de Puerto Rico include three requests for a medical license from a Chinese immigrant, Juan de Dios Sian (Lin Hua Cheng). Despite lacking legal credentials, he used herbal therapies to treat chronically ill persons in Ponce, San Juan and Mayaguez from 1851 to 1853. Before arriving in Ponce he had spent four years in Cuba, where he is again found by 1865. Sian\u2019s petitions show that Puerto Rico, like Cuba, experienced a widely known \u201cm\u00e9dico chino.\u201d The anecdote reminds us of important issues in our medical and social history: Asiatic immigration (earlier, larger and more diverse than usually considered), access to care (and its limitations), and the long history of herbal medicine in Oriental and Western cultures. Elements of this story, such as the eagerness for new treatments among patients who have derived no benefit from standard therapy, the ethics of medical licensing, the impotence of licensing agencies and the toleration of authorities regarding an unorthodox but popular healer, exemplify dilemmas that accompany medical practice at all times. [P R Health Sci J 2016;35:100-107 ]\nKey words: Chinese medicine, Herbal medicine, History of medicine, Asian immigra -\ntion, Medical licensing, Juan de Dios Sian, Puerto Rico\nThe phrase \u201ccan\u2019t be saved even by the Chinese physician\u201d (\u201cno lo salva ni el m\u00e9dico chino\u201d) is common parlance in Puerto Rico and Cuba to indicate a person with an \nincurable disease (1). Several websites relate the saying to the \nexpertise of Chinese herbal healers, particularly one called \u201cCham Bom-Bi\u00e1,\u201d who arrived in Cuba in 1854 (2). As historians Marcos Cueto and Steven Palmer have recently remarked, Latin America has served for centuries as a dynamic frontier between Western and non-Western medicine (3).\nIndeed, the Archivo General de Puerto Rico includes a file on \na Chinese healer. The anecdote of this \u201cm\u00e9dico chino\u201d serves to remind us of important issues in our medical and social history: Asiatic immigration (earlier, larger and more diverse than usually considered), medical licensure (rules and disobediences), access to care (and its limitations), the long history of herbal medicine in different cultures, and the attraction of unorthodox or novel therapies for patients who cannot access or do not benefit from standard treatments. Distant as the society of 1850 may seem to us, these are all strands in the web of present-day clinical practice.\nMassive emigration from China developed after the T reaty of \nNanking with the British (1842). In the following two decades, large numbers of Chinese (also called at the time \u201csons of the Celestial Empire\u201d) went to gold-rush California, Peru, Panama (to build an interoceanic railroad line), and Central America and British possessions in the Caribbean. In 1847, about 600 Chinese were taken to Cuba as indentured laborers to work in sugarcane fields. The program was suspended in a year, but \nlarge-scale Chinese immigration resumed in 1853. More than 125,000 arrived up to 1873 (4). Their community became a visible component of society and has survived to this day, with influence even in religion (5). \nIn Puerto Rico, three proposals to introduce Chinese field \nhands, from 1846 to 1857, did not come to fruition. Later, from 1865 to 1879, at least 335 Chinese convicts were sent here by courts in Cuba. They worked mostly on the construction of the Carretera Central, now Route 1, between Ponce and San Juan (from the south coast to the north coast) (6). These were not the first \u201csons of the Celestial Empire\u201d to arrive in Puerto Rico.\nJuan De Dios Sian\nOn 17 J\nune 1851, \u201cDon Juan de Dios Sian, native of China \nand resident in the town of Ponce,\u201d \u201cprofessor of medicine and botany,\u201d petitioned the island\u2019s governor to be allowed \u201cto assist suffering humanity in external diseases and those chronic conditions that have proven rebellious to the applications and \n10 Rigau.indd   100 5/19/2016   3:30:00 PMChinese Healer in Puerto Rico, 1851-1853\n101 PRHSJ Vol. 35 No. 2 \u2022 June, 2016Rigau-P\u00e9rez\n Chinese Healer in Puerto Rico, 1851-1853\nPRHSJ Vol. 35 No. 2 \u2022 June, 2016\ntreatments of other practitioners. \u201d He directed his request to the \ngovernor, because when he applied to the local representative of the Subdelegaci\u00f3n de Medicina y Cirug\u00eda (the institution that granted licensure to physicians from 1839 to 1899) (7) the official responded with insults, calling \u201cbarbaric the [Chinese] characters in the diploma. \u201d Sian alleged he had documents to show his curative success in the principal towns of Cuba, where he had met no opposition from the authorities. He insisted that his services would not interfere with the services provided by Ponce physicians to treat \u201cincipient or easily and frequently \ncured diseases,\u201d as he expected to address prolonged illnesses \nand those attended unsuccessfully by other professors. He offered to treat for free \u201cthe indigent and proletarian and for a modest fee [\u2026] those who recovered their health. \u201d The petition was signed by Jos\u00e9 Ulises Quesada as friend of Sian (who did not know how to sign in Spanish) but there is also a signature in three Chinese characters arranged vertically (Figure 1): Lin Hua Cheng (8).\nA long note by Antonio Fort\u00fan, \u201ccorregidor\u201d and military \ncommander of the Ponce district, (9) also dated 17 June, states \nSian arrived in Ponce with a travel permit issued by the military \nlieutenant-governor of Nuevitas (province of Camag\u00fcey), Cuba. \nThe bearer was identified as a botanist. On 22 May 1851, the governor of Puerto Rico had granted a residency permit for \nSian, his wife and a servant, also Chinese. (The wife\u2019s national \norigin is not mentioned.) \nFort\u00fan indicated that Sian, from the time of his arrival, and \nat the request of \u201cmany sufferers who had wasted their time and spent their money in long-term therapy of some diseases, provided treatments with herbs [yerbas], that must have had good results, because many have sought him. \u201d Fort\u00fan had heard of many cures, and that Sian gave free \u201cremedios\u201d (medicines or treatments) to the poor. Four cases with successful treatment, \npersonally known by Fort\u00fan, are mentioned by name: \nEduardo, son of Faustina Guzm\u00e1n, had been ordered to house \nconfinement by the previous \u201ccorregidor\u201d , to prevent his illness \n(\u201csaid to be that of Lazarus\u201d [leprosy]) from spreading to others. \u201cY esterday\u201d (16 June), Faustina brought the child before Fort\u00fan, who found no sign of illness. \nThe son of \u201cDon\u201d F\u00e9lix P\u00e9rez, commander of night watchmen \n(\u201cserenos\u201d) had been \u201cgiven up for lost\u201d due to a chest problem, but now the father had so much hope that he expressed \u201conly God\u2019s will could take the son from him\u201d .\nMateo Ravaina had for some time lost use of the left arm and \npart of the left leg, and could now use the arm and climb stairs. \n\u201cDon\u201d Guillermo Wogt [sic \u2013 Voigt? (10)] could now ride \na horse. \nFort\u00fan closed by indicating he provided this information \u201cin \nconsideration of suffering Humanity, but, as it [the situation] seems not to be in agreement with the current regulations on medicine\u201d , he asked the governor to resolve what seemed best (11).\n \nOn 21 June the governor referred the petition to the \nSubdelegaci\u00f3n de Medicina. On June 23, the Junta or Board of the Subdelegaci\u00f3n met and indicated to the governor that Sian should follow the standard procedure for validation of his foreign training: to present the original diploma with a request for licensure, undergo exams, pay a deposit, \u201cand further \nrequirements determined by superior orders. \u201d An exception in \nthe case of Sian would leave the Subdelegaci\u00f3n open to claims \nby other foreign physicians who had complied with the rules, \nand their respective consuls (12). On 25 June, the governor \nrelayed the response to Fort\u00fan (13).\n I have found no further information about Sian\u2019s sojourn in \nPonce. The only contemporary local newspaper, El Ponce\u00f1o, \nwas first published more than a year after Sian\u2019s petition. In its \ntwo-year run, there is a \u201cMedical address against charlatanism\u201d \nby Andr\u00e9s Pr\u00edncipe, one of the city\u2019s physicians, directed against \n\u201cignorants\u201d , \u201cold women\u201d , and \u201cimprovised philosophers\u201d , and the sick who follow their opinions and treatments. (14) Curiously, the \nnewspaper shows a great interest in Chinese immigration. There \nare at least five editorials (all in 1853) promoting the importation \nof Chinese agricultural laborers (15).\nSian wrote again to the governor nine months later (5 April \n1852), identifying himself as \u201cDon Juan de Dios de Jes\u00fas Sian, native of the city of Pequ\u00edn\u201d [Beijing]. He had arrived in San Juan, where there were witnesses of his many difficult cures obtained in other towns. He had been called by a multitude of persons with chronic diseases that had proved resistant to all \nefforts of attending physicians. In Cuba, he had practiced his \nprofession for over four years with the approval of all, \u201ceven \nof physicians. \u201d Sian requested the governor\u2019s (16) approval \n\u201cto attend the sick who insistently call him; the destitute, by providing them with the medication they may need, and all those Y our Excellency may order in one of the hospitals of the capital [\u2026]. \u201d This petition closes with Sian\u2019s full name in Spanish and a signature in Chinese (Figure 1). The first character is reminiscent of the rubrics used by Spanish notaries. It is followed by the three characters of the signature seen before, plus two new characters, the Chinese equivalent of \u201cMr. \u201d\nThe petition was again referred to the Subdelegaci\u00f3n (19 April \n1852). Its response, longer and more forcefully worded, reminded the governor of the Board\u2019s prior instructions, which Sian had not followed. They claimed that Sian\u2019s offer to treat the poor gratis indicated his ignorance of local laws, which would be violated by \nsuch behavior even if he were authorized to practice. In addition, \nthey mentioned the dangers of allowing unlicensed persons to attend to patients, the obligations of government officials to prevent it, and (in a veiled reminder to the governor) that if officials \u201cforgot their duties\u201d in this regard, others could complain to the Real Junta Superior Gubernativa de Medicina y Cirug\u00eda (the central medical agency of the government in Madrid) which would ask the sovereign to punish the negligent officials (17).\nIn addition, the group denounced Sian\u2019s activities in San Juan \nto the governor. The man, \u201cknown as el m\u00e9dico chino\u201d was treating patients with medications that he prepared and then sold \u201cat apparently immoderate prices. \u201d This was a continuation of his behavior in Ponce and other towns, which he had confessed \n10 Rigau.indd   101 5/19/2016   3:30:01 PMChinese Healer in Puerto Rico, 1851-1853102\nPRHSJ Vol. 35 No. 2 \u2022 June, 2016Rigau-P\u00e9rez\u201cbrazenly or inadvertently\u201d in his latest petition. The Board \nrequested the governor that the prescribed penalties fall on the law-breaker: for the first offense, a fine of 50 ducados [about \n$3,000-45,000 in present-day dollars (18)]; for the second, 100 \nducados with banishment from the town of residence and from within 10 leagues of Madrid and royal residences; and for the third offense, 200 ducados and banishment to the military forts of Africa or America. The law allowed that these punishments be imposed without the need for trial, \u201cas the infractions mentioned \nare usually publicly notorious\u201d (19).\nThree months later (21 July 1852), two Mayag\u00fcez residents, \nJos\u00e9 Paradic and U. Basora, wrote to the governor. They \nclaimed to be \u201cin a desperate state because of their health\u201d and \u201creverently\u201d begged the governor to authorize Sian to practice without opposition from the local Board of Health and other physicians, and that pharmacists dispense the medications he \nmight prescribe (20).\nEight months later, on 30 March 1853, Sian again petitioned \nthe governor for \u201cpermission to cure\u201d , and presented himself \nas resident of San Juan. His reasons for not complying with the law, and nevertheless requesting acceptance as a successful practitioner bear quoting at length:\n Ignorant of the laws of the foreign countries I would visit, I did not \nprocure, on leaving China, a certificate of my medical profession, which anyway would not have been possible, as such titles are not accustomed there. Studies are pursued privately, and each person practices the scientific profession to which he is inclined when teachers consider him skillful after experiments in the practice of \nthe methods. There are no universities or colleges, and studies are \nnot regulated; so much so, that for primary education there are no public schools, but teachers go to homes. That is why I cannot present any other title than my adequacy in the art of healing. And this I cannot show if I submit to an examination of basic \nknowledge [examen te\u00f3rico] due to the immense difference in the manner of learning, and because, not possessing Spanish, Latin, or \nthe common modern languages, I would not be able to understand \nthe questions or express the answers and decisions. Nevertheless, I can give practical proof, if asked to take care of patients leprous, \n\u201c\u00e9ticos\u201d [with hectic fever, as in consumption], or with other grave \nconditions if still at the stage in which medicine can help. And the \noutcome will declare if my science is exact and my method produces \nthe good result of providing health. T o this is added the good success I have had in this island and in \nCuba [\u2026] of which cases I could present a thousand documents \nbut limit myself to the five enclosed, among them one from the \nmunicipality of Santa Mar\u00eda de Puerto Pr\u00edncipe [Camag\u00fcey], \nwhere at the request of a physician, and following the reports of \nthe Inspection and Subdelegaci\u00f3n of the profession (due to prior \nknowledge of my practice) I was associated to the requesting \nphysician to cure the leprosy or San L\u00e1zaro\u2019s malady that scourged \nthat country at the time (21).This was signed only in ideograms, as the first petition, but \nwith an additional fourth Chinese character (Figure 1). \nThe last document on file, dated six weeks later (18 May \n1853), is a receipt to the \u201cSecretar\u00eda de este Gobierno\u201d (the governor\u2019s office) for the documents \u201cenclosed with an \napplication for permit to practice medicine and surgery in this \nisland,\u201d signed by Sian (three Chinese characters only) (22). The minutes of the Board of the Subdelegaci\u00f3n, reviewed through \nthe end of 1855, and the list of physicians whose diplomas were \nregistered by the Subdelegaci\u00f3n from 1846 to 1897, offer no \nmention of Sian (23).\n \nDiscussion\n\u201cEl medico chino\u201d \u2013 The Chinese physician\nAs indicated at the beginning of this article, the reference to \n\u201cel medico chino\u201d is common to Puerto Rico and Cuba. In the \nFigure 1. Signatures in Juan de Jes\u00fas Sian\u2019s petitions   17 June 1851 30 March 1853 5 April 1852\n10 Rigau.indd   102 5/19/2016   3:30:01 PMChinese Healer in Puerto Rico, 1851-1853\n103 PRHSJ Vol. 35 No. 2 \u2022 June, 2016Rigau-P\u00e9rez\nlatter, it is frequently associated with one individual, Cham Bom \nBi\u00e1, who arrived in Cuba in 1854. Academic publications also mention his name, but in addition, they reveal that the presence of, and fascination with a \u201cm\u00e9dico chino\u201d started with the first massive arrival of Asians in Havana (24). Sian\u2019s personal story provokes many questions; to start with, what was his name? There are three different Chinese signatures in his documents. All include three characters \u2013 Lin Hua Cheng. Each of the second and third signatures illustrated include a larger ideogram that is difficult to interpret; these seem to be \u201cseals\u201d , or combinations \nof characters that served as good luck charms with the signature. \nThe seal at the end of the third signature may mean good or great luck, or great fortune. \nIf the three invariant characters are said in the Western \nmanner, with family name last, he would be Hua Cheng Lin. Perhaps Hua suggested Juan as a first name. Appropriately, he was Juan de Dios ( John of God), which not only associated him with the Deity, but gave him the name of a saint who healed the poor (25). In subsequent petitions, Sian is Juan de Dios de Jes\u00fas, further associating his name with beneficence, healing, \nand Western religion.\nWe do not know when Sian arrived in Ponce. Before that, he \nhad spent four years in Cuba, which would place him with the \nfirst arrival of Chinese workers, but he does not fit that social \ncategory. He is always treated with the courtesy title of \u201cDon\u201d \n(even in Subdelegaci\u00f3n documents), to indicate distinction. We can tell he was brave and persistent, because he practiced his skills openly, even informing authorities of his actions and whereabouts. He talks of leaving China to \u201cvisit\u201d foreign countries, as if he were a tourist. He left Cuba with a legal permit and was granted residency in Puerto Rico in May 1851. What profession, property or capital did he declare to request the permit? (26).\nRecent internet postings of Cuban newspapers provide \nadditional information, based on the research of Camaguey \nhistorians and interviews with Sian\u2019s descendants. If the age \nof 68 years given in an 1879 census is correct, he was about 36 years old when the first Chinese laborers arrived in Havana. It is said he went as a physician, (surprisingly) with a capital of 20,000 Spanish pesos in gold. His skills were quickly acclaimed by the sick, but he was forced to close his practice when authorities asked for his diploma. He moved to Puerto Pr\u00edncipe (Camaguey) in 1848 (27). He converted to Catholicism very publicly, by interrupting a Good Friday procession, dressed in Oriental garb and kneeling before the image of Christ on the \ncross. Baptism with a Christian name followed on 25 April 1850. \nHe developed a medical practice, and dressed in Occidental \nfashion (28).\nIn the spring of 1851, a pro-independence conspiracy \nin Camaguey (Ag\u00fcero\u2019s rebellion) was discovered by the \nauthorities. Sian perhaps left Camaguey at that time, and Puerto Rico may have been the most convenient refuge, as another colony of Spain \u2013with similar language, customs, and laws. Communications were relatively easy with Ponce, equally or more active as a port than San Juan (29). He eventually returned to Camaguey; the name of Juan de Dios Sian, in that city, is included among the myriad signatories of an 1865 petition for economic reforms, abolition of the slave trade and political representation in the Spanish Congress. (30) He had children in and out of wedlock, and some of his descendants still live in Camaguey (31). At his death (23 March 1885), an obituary praised his \u201cgood success in the science of Galen\u201d (28).\nOriental and Occidental herbal medicine\nIf Sian was truly a Chinese \u201cprofessor of medicine and \nbotany,\u201d what would have been the basis of his knowledge? His \nculture, over a millennial history, had deduced its own ideas of physiology and disease causation, and a diversity of therapies that cannot be covered here. He claimed to cure external diseases, particularly leprosy (a diagnostic category that at the time covered many dermatologic manifestations), and maladies which (Western) medical treatment had not healed. As curative methods, he only mentioned herbs, for which his country, even now, is renowned. China has an uninterrupted tradition of \nwritten treatises on medications ( Pen-ts\u2019 ao) from around 65 CE. \nThe Pen-ts\u2019 ao kang-mu (Materia medica arranged according to \ndrug descriptions and technical aspects), composed by Li Shih-\nchen (1518-1593) mostly mentions plants, was translated to \nall oriental languages, and in 1930 still constituted the basis for \nChinese pharmacopeia (32). In 2015, one of the Nobel Prizes in Medicine was awarded to Mrs. Tu Y ouyou, for the chemical isolation of an effective medication against malaria from the plant recommended by herbalist tradition.\nWestern practice has also shown a millennial concern about \nvegetable medicine. The Egyptians, in the Ebers papyrus of about 1550 BCE, Dioscorides in the first century CE, Nicol\u00e1s Monardes and Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez and their research on New \nWorld plants in the sixteenth century, and the discovery of the \nutility of cinchona (quinine), foxglove (digitalis), and bark of \nwillow tree (salicylic acid) are a few examples of occidental \ninterests (33). Therefore, herbal treatments were also part of routine practice in Puerto Rico, but as the result of different medical epistemology and heuristics. Even acupuncture, which Sian does not mention, was practiced in Europe and the United States in the early nineteenth century by a small number of physicians (but fell out of favor by 1859) (34).\nSian was in Puerto Rico at the same time as Ren\u00e9 de \nGrosourdy, a better known botanist in our history. We might imagine them meeting, as embodiments of the Oriental and \nOccidental strains of herbal medicine. Grosourdy, a graduate of \nthe University of Paris, validated his diploma in Puerto Rico on \n21 January 1852 (35). In 1864 he published El m\u00e9dico bot\u00e1nico \ncriollo (The America-born botanical physician), based on ten \nyears\u2019 travel and practice throughout the Caribbean (36). The \nfour-volume work served as a domestic reference for those far from standard health care (possibly not individual homes, but plantations with a large number of slaves) (37). Western medical theory still held that location and climate determined \n10 Rigau.indd   103 5/19/2016   3:30:01 PMChinese Healer in Puerto Rico, 1851-1853\n104 PRHSJ Vol. 35 No. 2 \u2022 June, 2016Rigau-P\u00e9rez\nthe characteristics of local diseases. Concomitantly, local \nphysicians claimed their treatments were most likely to provide a cure. Domestic medical manuals such as Grosourdy\u2019s enjoyed success, as they linked general scientific concepts with local environmental conditions and botanical resources (38). In contrast to the long effort by Grosourdy, how could Sian learn so quickly of the healing properties of Caribbean plants? He may have learned about Western concepts in his native country, and about Caribbean diseases and plants during his years in Cuba.\nOccidental medical practices\nResearch in the history of health and health care in Puerto \nRico is limited by the absence of documentation. Many \nnineteenth-century newspapers have left no trace (39). The archives of individuals and private institutions are unavailable, or, most commonly, non-existent. The archives of government agencies are also largely unaccounted for. The health-related material in the Archivo General de Puerto Rico comes from the municipalities or the governors\u2019 office; there is no significant body of documents from the Department of Health (established \nin 1911), its antecedent agencies, or its activities in the twentieth \nand twenty-first centuries. The archives of the Subdelegaci\u00f3n de \nMedicina, ten books consulted by Salvador Arana Soto in the offices of the T ribunal Examinador de M\u00e9dicos in the 1960s \n(40) are still in its daughter agency, the Junta de Licenciamiento \ny Disciplina M\u00e9dica.\nIn preindustrial societies, access to licensed physicians was \nrare (41). In Puerto Rico their number was low (about 170 for a million people at the end of the century) (42) and a significant proportion were foreigners. Of the 24 physicians awarded licenses in Puerto Rico from 1848 to 1853, eight (33%) graduated in universities outside of Spain and had non-Hispanic names (23). Licensed physicians concentrated in \nurban areas (and especially in San Juan, Ponce and Mayag\u00fcez, \ncities Sian visited), and consultation was usually expensive. \nSome supplemented their income by serving as \u201cM\u00e9dico titular\u201d \nof the municipality, to attend the certified indigent (\u201cpobres de solemnidad\u201d), but Ponce did not have such a position in 1852. Instead, all licensed physicians had a \u201cpublic service\u201d obligation, which produced bitter complains about the onerous, unpaid labor (distant journeys, often unnecessary, on bad roads at any time or weather, forensic investigations, the patients\u2019 ingratitude) (43). The Subdelegaci\u00f3n\u2019s statement (19 April 1852) that provision of free care was not allowed by regulations is surprising. This may have been legal only for \u201cm\u00e9dicos titulares\u201d \nor the certified indigent. Some physicians served plantations by \na pre-arranged fee (44). It may be that, paradoxically, slaves were \nmore likely to be attended by physicians than poor free laborers, \nwho had no one to safeguard them as valuable property. That \npopulation, dispersed in rural areas and highly illiterate, could \nresort to personal knowledge, the recommendations of relatives and acquaintances, \u201ccuranderos\u201d (traditional healers), the Deity and the saints, and in extreme cases, witchcraft, spirits or any promising novelty (45). Medical licensure\nThe licensing examinations contemplated by ancient \nChinese texts had disappeared by the nineteenth century (46). \nPractitioners trained as apprentices in the 40-century-old theory and practice (who charged high fees), benevolent scholars who \nstudied classical treatises as a hobby (and might not charge), \nempirically-trained members of hereditary medical families, and sellers of herbs practiced side-by-side (47).\nShould the Subdelegaci\u00f3n have given Sian a license to \npractice? From their point of view, as enforcers of the laws to regulate the practice of medicine, it was impossible. Besides, the more information he provided, the further he discredited his case. He first claimed he presented a document in Ponce, but later stated he had no diploma. Instead, he proposed that the Board trust his (alleged) track record, and allow, as in China, \u201cexperiments in the practice of the methods\u201d to show his skill. We only know of the four cures noted by Fort\u00fan, but there is no follow-up to detect relapses or a report of how many treatments were unproductive. If Sian did not know any Western languages, how did he manage in his travels? How could he understand patients, give them instructions, communicate with pharmacists and with whoever prepared his petitions to the government? Perhaps he only meant he lacked the ability to discuss medical subjects technically.\nGrosourdy came as both researcher and practitioner, because \nhe took care to be certified by the Subdelegaci\u00f3n. Professional licensure assured government control, theoretical orthodoxy, fair competition, and quality in health care. Licensing appears as self-evidently beneficial to us, in part because of its 500-year use in Puerto Rico. Although the Chinese avoidance of \ncredentialing seemed uncivilized to Spanish practitioners, it \nwas not an exclusive practice of the Far East. Social support for medical licensure disappeared in some Western countries in the mid-1800s. Colombia, where Spanish law had applied in colonial times, in 1850 eliminated the requirement of a university diploma for the practice of all professions except pharmacy. Medical students would follow courses until they considered themselves capable to practice medicine (48). In the United States, almost every state had some legal control over licensure before the 1830s, and none by the 1860s (49). \nThese changes were motivated, in part, by the diffusion of \nthe ideas of the first economic and political liberalism, that opposed governmental regulation, but also by the low efficacy of institutionalized medicine. Western practice in 1850 was reliably successful mostly in a small number of surgical procedures and some manipulations. Disease theory, oriented by concepts of imbalance, miasma, contagion, climate, and environmental and racial determinism, had insufficient understanding of the causes \nand pathologic processes of what we now consider infectious, \nmetabolic, immunologic, malignant, and mental illnesses (50). \nT reatments and medicines were often harmful and usually \nexpensive. Among the frequent advertisements in the newspaper El Ponce\u00f1o, one finds Holloway\u2019s pills and ointment. The latter\u2019s composition was not declared; it solved mostly external \n10 Rigau.indd   104 5/19/2016   3:30:01 PMChinese Healer in Puerto Rico, 1851-1853\n105 PRHSJ Vol. 35 No. 2 \u2022 June, 2016Rigau-P\u00e9rez\nproblems (\u201cbumps, cramps, corns, cancers, cuts,\u201d \u201cleprosy,\u201d \nreptile and mosquito bites) but also diseases of the anus, liver, and joints, cold extremities, and nervous tremor, among others. \nThe pills were made \u201centirely from medicinal herbs, without \nmercury or any other noxious substance. \u201d They addressed mostly internal ailments: \u201cepileptic accidents, asthma, hemorrhoids,\u201d \u201call kinds of fevers,\u201d \u201cliver diseases, venereal diseases, gout, dropsy, jaundice,\u201d \u201cworms of all kinds,\u201d constipation, urinary retention, pulmonary consumption and many others (51). Both products, available in pharmacies in different towns, evidently without need of physician prescription, cost 4, 8 and 12 \u201creales\u201d for a small container (\u201cel frasquito\u201d). At the time, a rural laborer earned 2-3 reales for a 12-hour day of work (52). Spanish and \nGerman leeches cost 1.5-3 reales per specimen, and an ounce \nof quinine sulfate cost 4 pesos (32 reales) (53).\nFor the United States, it is estimated that a \u201cpatient seeing an \ninternist could expect reasonably safe and efficacious (though certainly imperfect) treatment for a variety of serious ailments\u201d \nonly beginning around 1935-1945 (54). This, of course, does \nnot take into account the situations in which the healer\u2019s empathy produces a cure by a change in the patient\u2019s attitude or behavior. In such a context, \u201cel m\u00e9dico chino,\u201d even with rudimentary knowledge, if armed with a persuasive personality, may have cured many who had never seen a physician, and some whose medical treatment was unsuccessful or harmful.\nConclusion\nSian\u2019s petitions expand the story of the early impact of Chinese \nimmigration in the Spanish Antilles, and show that Puerto Rico, shortly after Cuba, experienced at least one widely known \u201cm\u00e9dico chino. \u201d He faced prejudice as a Chinese (his documents \nshowed \u201cbarbaric\u201d characters), and other physicians opposed \nhim for not charging patients, for using methods they did not know, and most likely also because he could be a competitor for paying patients. Nevertheless, his practice of medicine attracted much attention among patients and government officials throughout the Island and demonstrates wide acceptance of herbal treatments at the time. As Cueto and Palmer have indicated for Latin America, popular medicine in Puerto Rico in the mid-nineteenth century incorporated elements of all medicines and religions, and all segments of society made use \nof such healing practices (55). This is now a reality beyond \nLatin America. In the population-based 2007 U.S. National \nHealth Interview Survey, 24 % of respondents aged 18 years or \nmore, without cancer, used herbal therapies and \u201csupplements\u201d \n(i. e., chondroitin, fish oil, glucosamine) in the previous year, compared to 32 % of those with cancer (56). In Puerto Rico, a recent unpublished study in one hospital found 143 of 233 (61 %) cancer patients aged 21 years or more used vitamins or medicines based on plants (57).\nIn addition, Sian\u2019s documents open a window onto the \ncontemporary procedures regarding medical licensing and health care. We see a bureaucracy that is surprisingly rapid in some aspects: on June 17 Sian submits his petition in Ponce; \nthe same day it is forwarded by the \u201ccorregidor\u201d and in 8 days \nthe response, which involved two agencies, is sent back to Ponce. Sian gets a rapid answer to his petition (even if it is not what he requests) but the Subdelegaci\u00f3n\u2019s complaints of Sian\u2019s infractions go unanswered. Paradoxically, the civilian physicians in the \u201cSubdelegaci\u00f3n\u201d , trained in European capitals, hold a rigid and legalistic position, opposed to the flexible attitude of \nmilitary officers who hold office at central and local levels. In the \ncontext of a large underserved population, they admit that Sian\u2019s \nactions were not \u201cin agreement with the current regulations\u201d , \nbut they let him act. \nPrescribed medications, too, were expensive and often toxic. \nFort\u00fan emphasizes that Sian provided free remedies to the \npoor, while the Subdelegaci\u00f3n accuses the Asiatic to sell them at immoderate prices. Inmoderate, when apothecaries in Ponce sold a single leech for up to 3 reales, the salary for 12 hours of work by a well-paid laborer? T ranslated to the current minimal salary in Puerto Rico, the leech would cost $87 dollars.\nThroughout the nineteenth century, licensed physicians \ndenounced the activities of  \u201ccuranderos,\u201d \u201ccuriosos,\u201d \u201cintrusos\u201d or, as Sian was called in Ponce, charlatans. \u00bfShould the Subdelegaci\u00f3n have granted Sian a license to practice medicine? As the organism charged with enforcing the laws \nthat regulated the practice of medicine, it was impossible. \nNevertheless, in the face of so few physicians and so many needing help, was it the best response to the ethical dilemma between forbidding cures not allowed by the law, and tolerating an unauthorized healer?\nElements of Sian\u2019s story, such as the eager welcome for new \ntreatments among hopeless patients, the cost of medications, medical licensing, the impotence of the licensing agency to control an unorthodox but popular healer, and the toleration of authorities, exemplify situations that accompany medical practice at all times. The study of the historical circumstances of the medical profession is, in addition, a rich source for \nthe ethical training of professionals in facing current-day \nproblems.\nResumen\nEn Puerto Rico y Cuba, la frase popular \u201cno lo salva ni el \nm\u00e9dico chino\u201d indica un caso incurable. Los documentos en \nel Archivo General de Puerto Rico incluyen tres solicitudes de \nlicencia para practicar la medicina del inmigrante chino Juan \nde Dios Sian (Lin Hua Cheng).
