And although it may not seem like it, in themselves they are necessary for our body but there must be a balance betweenre free radicals and antioxidants. Antioxidants are vitamins and minerals responsible for protecting our cells and mitigating the effects of free radicals by balancing this balance.\nThe cold press is a vegetable juice extraction procedure that minimizes oxidation and preserves the nutrients in the liquid intact. In the first phase, the ingredients are crushed at low revolutions, thus preventing the temperature from rising andits nutrients are destroyed. The crushed ingredients are then pressed, extracting every last drop of liquid. Thus we obtain a pure juice, full of life and flavor, as if we were drinking directly from the fruit.\nnutritional information\n- Raw\nFresh\nWithout\ncolorants\nPlant\nBased\nNot\npasteurized\n100%\nnatural\nNo\nadded\nsugars\nWithout\npreservatives\n[\nSee full nutritional information\n](#nutri-info-tbl-1052)\n|Energetic value||109 kJ/26 kcal|\n|Fats||0,2 g|\n|Of which saturates||0,1 g|\n|Carbohydrates||5,3 g|\n|Of which sugar||4,3 g|\n|Protein||0,8 g|\n|Fiber||< 0,5 g|\n|Salt||0,2 g|", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": "website", "links": ["https://flaxandkale.com/es/apuntate-newsletter", "/en", "#menu-language-phone", "/lang/es", "/lang/en", null, null, null, "#menu-3726", "/en/restaurants", "https://flaxandkale.com/en/flax-and-kale-tallers", "https://flaxandkale.com/en/flaxkale-trafalgar", "https://flaxandkale.com/en/flax-and-kale-passage", "https://flaxandkale.com/en/flax-kale-la-roca", "#menu-3718", "/en/detox-cleanse-plans", "https://flaxandkale.com/es/quiz-detox", "https://flaxandkale.com/en/fat-burn-detox", "https://flaxandkale.com/en/detox-pre-event", "https://flaxandkale.com/en/my-first-detox", "https://flaxandkale.com/en/detox-pro", "#menu-4635", null, "#menu-user", "https://flaxandkale.com/register", "https://flaxandkale.com/login", null, null, null, null, "#menu-3715", "https://flaxandkale.com/en/flax-and-kale-tallers", null, "https://flaxandkale.com/en/flaxkale-trafalgar", null, "https://flaxandkale.com/en/flax-and-kale-passage", null, "https://flaxandkale.com/en/flax-kale-la-roca", "/en/restaurants", "/en/restaurants", null, null, null, null, null, null, "/lang/es", "/lang/en", "https://flaxandkale.com/login", "https://flaxandkale.com/register", "https://flaxandkale.com/password/reset", "/en", "/en/shop", "/en/cold-pressed-juices", null, "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://flaxandkale.com/en/detox-cold-pressed-juice", "whatsapp://send?text=Detox https://flaxandkale.com/en/detox-cold-pressed-juice", "mailto:?subject=Flax And Kale&body=https://flaxandkale.com/en/detox-cold-pressed-juice", null, "#panel-all_ingredients", "#panel-nutritional_info", "#panel-3", "#panel-1844", "#panel-1051", "#nutri-info-tbl-1052", "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "#folding-2169", "/en/kombucha", "/en/detox-cleanse-plans", "/en/packs", "/en/frequent-questions", "#folding-2328", "/en/flax-and-kale-tallers", "/en/flax-and-kale-passage", "/en/flaxkale-trafalgar", "#folding-1273", "/en/inside", "/en/contact_us", "/en/work-with-us", "/en/sustainability", "/en/inside-innovation", "/en/our-history", "https://www.facebook.com/flaxandkale", "https://twitter.com/teresacarleshf", "https://www.youtube.com/@flaxandkale_int", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/teresa-carles-healthy-foods/", "https://www.instagram.com/kombucha.flaxandkale/", "/en/4300", "/en/frequent-questions", "/en/contact_us", "/en/legal-warning", "/en/privacy-policy", "/en/cookies-policy", "/en/general-contracting-conditions"]}
