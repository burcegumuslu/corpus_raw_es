Integrative medicine can be beneficial for treating a wide range of conditions, including those that haven't responded to typical treatments.\nIntegrative medicine may include botanical and nutritional supplements, Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture, cupping, Gua Sha, massage, journaling, relaxation and breathing techniques, guided imagery, spiritual support, and lifestyle modifications, such as stress management, nutrition, exercise and sleep.\nThe Integrative Medicine department at Baylor Scott & White consists of doctors of Chinese Medicine, licensed acupuncturists and licensed massage therapists who treat patients throughout the Greater Austin Region.\nThe team works with specialists and primary care physicians throughout our system to create a tailored treatment plan for each patient based on their current condition. Acupuncture and massage therapy are non-referral based modalities. Therefore, anyone, whether they are a patient of Baylor Scott & White or not, can get treatment. We are in network with most commercial insurance providers and will work with you to determine insurance coverage.\nConditions treated by integrative medicine\nSome of the most common conditions that may benefit from integrative medicine include:\n- Allergies\n- Autoimmune conditions\n- Digestive issues\n- Headaches and migraines\n- Neurological disorders\n- Orthopedics\n- Pain management\n- Pre- and post-operative care\n- Pregnancy support\n- Reproductive health\n- Stress and anxiety\n- Strokes\nPregnancy Support\nThe Integrative Medicine Department provides safe and effective prenatal and postnatal care alongside your obstetrician. If you are experiencing any symptoms, consider discussing a referral to Integrative Medicine with your physician to determine whether treatments are appropriate for you:\nChinese medicine (acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine)\n- Fertility assistance (natural or alongside ART)\n- Back pain, pelvic pain, sciatica, round ligament pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, headaches\n- Poor sleep, fatigue, vivid dreaming\n- Stress, anxiety, depression\n- Hot flashes, morning sickness\n- Labor preparation and induction\n- Correction of fetal malposition/breech presentation\n- Postpartum exhaustion, incontinence\n- Scar pain\n- Mastitis, low milk supply\n- General wellness\nMassage therapy\n- Back pain, sciatica, round ligament pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, headaches\n- Generalized tension and discomfort\n- Stress, anxiety\n- Mild swelling, general wellness\nAcupuncture\nA popular form of integrative medicine is acupuncture, which is highly effective as a stand-alone treatment but also works well together with your traditional physician care and/or therapy.\nAcupuncture relies on the system of traditional Chinese medicine to balance the body and restore health in patients with a diverse range of concerns. Acupuncture points fall along meridians (nerve pathways) and therefore create a systemic effect. The insertion of these fine, solid, single-use acupuncture needles typically produces no pain response, and most patients note that treatments are extremely relaxing.\nBecause it has a systemic effect and balances the entire body, acupuncture is a great treatment option for health concerns that appear to have no cause or remedy. In addition, many patients notice positive changes not part of their initial complaint, such as more restful sleep, increased energy, improved digestion and decreased stress.\nConditions treated:\n- Pain management\n- Acute/ chronic injury\n- Digestive issues\n- Women\u2019s health including menopause and fertility support\n- Autoimmune conditions\n- Headaches/migraines\n- Stress, anxiety, poor sleep, fatigue\n- Post-op healing and recovery\nHerbal medicine\nHerbal medicine is a natural yet powerful approach that involves formulating a combination of herbs that will best suit an individual\u2019s path to healing.\nOur providers work closely with patients and their physicians to choose safe and effective options for a wide range of conditions. Herbal supplements, including Chinese herbal formulas are often used in conjunction with acupuncture or can be used as a standalone treatment option.\nConditions treated:\n- Headaches/migraines\n- Allergies\n- Stress/anxiety\n- Poor sleep, fatigue\n- Digestive issues\n- Menopausal symptoms\nMassage therapy\nMassage is believed to be one of the oldest forms of medical care, dating back to the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. Today, the term massage therapy is used to describe the manipulation of soft tissue\u2014muscles, skin and/or tendons\u2014by fingertips, hands, fists, elbows and even feet to promote health and healing.\nAt Baylor Scott & White Health, massage therapy is part of our integrative medicine approach in which therapists work together with primary care providers and specialists to identify dysfunction and develop individualized treatment plans. Many people view massage as a luxury, but it can act as more than simple relaxation. Routine therapeutic massage\u2014especially within the context of a treatment plan\u2014can contribute to sustained good health and increased function.\nConditions treated:\n- Pain management\n- Headaches/migraines\n- Pre- and post- natal support\n- Acute or chronic injury\n- Stress/anxiety\n- Pre- and post-operative care\nFrequently asked questions\n-\nDoes acupuncture hurt?\nAcupuncture is typically painless or nearly painless. The needles are very fine, and are even flexible! This allows for a comfortable, relaxing experience for most patients. Some patients find that needle insertion feels similar to a strand of hair being pulled. However, everyone\u2019s perception of discomfort is different, and some patients are naturally more sensitive than others. Our acupuncturists also offer acupressure for those who are hesitant or nervous about acupuncture. Your provider will meet you where you are, so never hesitate to voice your concerns or apprehensions.\n-\nCan you combine acupuncture and massage with other therapies, such as physical therapy/exercise, chiropractic care, or medication?\nYes! Acupuncture is a versatile tool that works well in conjunction with other therapies and medical care. If you are currently in physical therapy, just let your therapist know you have had acupuncture or a massage so they can make any adjustments to your session if needed.\n-\nHow should I prepare for my acupuncture or massage treatment?\nHave a light snack before coming for treatment. Acupuncture on an empty stomach can cause light-headedness for some people. Take all medications as directed by your doctor \u2013 there is no need to skip a dose. Wear loose, comfortable clothing or bring a change of clothes with you.\n-\nWhat should I tell my provider before treatment?\nBe sure to let your acupuncturist or massage therapist know what medications you are on, if you\u2019ve had a medication change, are pregnant or are trying to become pregnant, or if you have any allergies. If there are areas you do not want to be worked on, never hesitate to let your provider know. Mention any sunburns, open wounds, edema, and/or recent surgical sites, as these areas will need to be avoided.\n-\nWhat should I expect to feel like after my acupuncture treatment?\nMost people feel pleasantly relaxed after acupuncture treatment. Some people can feel tired after treatment, especially if it is your first or second treatment. This is usually a sign your body is reacting to the stimulation of the treatment, and typically only lasts 1-3 hours. If you don\u2019t feel tired, or even if you feel energized, still try to take it easy on acupuncture days! Light to moderate activity is ok, such as light housework and errands, leisurely walking, etc. The best advice is to listen to your body, and recover if needed.\nIf trigger points or muscle pain are addressed, you may feel some mild soreness for a day or two. You can improve or prevent soreness by drinking some extra water, applying gentle heat to the area, or even taking a nice soak in a warm bath with Epsom salts. Despite any possible soreness, many people feel some relief in musculoskeletal pain the same day following treatment, or the maybe next day.\n-\nHow many acupuncture or massage treatments will I need to schedule?\nTreatment frequency is highly dependent on the chronicity and severity of each condition. During your initial consult, our providers will create a personalized treatment plan catered to your specific needs. Note that chronic conditions typically take longer to treat than acute conditions.\n-\nWhat is cupping?\nCupping, also called vasopneumatic therapy, is a myofascial therapy (works on your muscles and fascia). It is often used for neck and back pain, headaches, migraines, and muscle strains. A specialized silicone, glass, or plastic cup is placed on a specific area, usually over muscle tension, and a vacuum is created. This vacuum will increase circulation to the area, help loosen tight muscles and decrease fascial adhesions, or \u201csticky\u201d and tight areas in the muscle. The effects can be similar to the relief and outcome from a deep tissue massage in a shorter amount of time, and without the significant pressure of a massage.\nCupping therapy has been used across cultures for millennia, and still has a place in modern medicine. Physical therapists, chiropractors, massage therapists, and Olympic athletes even use cupping therapy. You may have seen the round, red or purple marks on elite athletes on TV. These marks are not true bruises, and are not sore to the touch. These are vacuum marks, and are created when the vacuum of the cup increases blood flow to the area. These marks often resolve in 2-5 days, depending on the patient.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links":
