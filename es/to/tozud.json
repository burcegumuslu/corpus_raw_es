Contaminated bottom \nsediments can have direct adverse impacts on \nbottom fauna. Contaminated sediments can also \nbe a long-term source of toxic substances to the \nenvironment and can impact wildlife and humans \nthrough the consumption of food or water or \nthrough direct contact. These impacts may be \npresent even though the overlying water meets \nwater quality criteria. As a result, something \nmore than the traditional water and effluent \nquality-based control and monitoring approaches \nwill be needed to protect and restore the quality \nof the Nation\u2019s rivers, lakes, estuaries, and \nembayments. \nIn recognition of the significance of the \nproblem, the U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) has begun a comprehensive con- \ntaminated sediment program. The effort began in \n1985, when EPA examined the potential national \nextent of sediment contamination using existing \nsediment monitoring data from the EPA Storage \nand Retrieval System (STORET) database (Bolton \net al., 1985). These data were compared to \norganic carbon-normalized threshold concen- \ntrations calculated from existing water quality \ncriteria using the equilibrium partitioning model. \nIn 1986, the EPA formed the Sediment Criteria \nTechnical Advisory Committee to examine possi- \nble approaches for deriving regulatory criteria for \nsediments. In 1988, EPA formed two oversight \ncommittees to take a comprehensive look at the \nwhole range of contaminated sediment issues: the \nSediment Oversight Steering Committee, which is \nresponsible for overall management of the pro- \ngram, and the Sediment Oversight Technical \nCommittee, which is oriented toward technical \nissues and is the implementation arm of the \nSteering Committee. These committees have \nprepared a draft outline describing EPA\u2019s Contam- \ninated Sediment Management Strategy and have formed working groups to focus on specific issues \nand approaches to sediment management. The \ncommittees are also sponsoring a number of \nactivities aimed at providing basic information \nabout contaminated sediment issues to persons \nwithin the Agency and to the interested public. \nThis compendium of sediment assessment methods \nis one of the committees\u2019 products. \nAn important initial step in addressing the \ncontaminated sediments problem is the identi- \nfication of scientifically sound methods that can \nbe used to assess whether and to what extent sedi- \nments are \u201ccontaminated\u201d or have the potential for \nposing a threat to the environment. The Sediment \nOversight Technical Committee compiled this \ncompendium of sediment assessment methods \nthrough the efforts of the committee members and \nothers who are experienced in the state of the art \nin sediment assessment. \nMany factors can affect the kinds and magni- \ntudes of impacts that contaminated sediments have \non the environment. The sediment assessment \ntools vary in their suitability and sensitivity for \ndetecting these different endpoints and effects. It \nis, therefore, important to properly match the \nassessment methods to the site- and program- \nspecific objectives of the study being conducted. \nThe suite of assessment methods presented in this \ncompendium offers a rich repertoire of tools from \nwhich to select the most suitable tests for a given \nsituation. \nUnfortunately, there simply is no single \nmethod that will measure all contaminated sedi- \nment impacts at all times and to all biological \norganisms. This is the result of a number of \nfactors, including environmental heterogeneity and \nassociated sampling problems, variability in the \nlaboratory exposures, analytical variability, differ- \ning sensitivities of different organisms to different \ntypes of contaminants, the confounding effects \ncaused by the presence of unmeasured contami- \nnants, the synergistic and antagonistic effects of \ncontaminants, and the physical properties of \nsediments. While one method will suffice for \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \nsome circumstances, it is often advisable to use \nseveral complementary methods rather than a \nsingle one. When several of these approaches are \nused together, they can provide additional insights \ninto the nature and degree of sediment contamina- \ntion problems. The use of complementary assess- \nment methods can provide a kind of independent \nverification of the degree of sediment contamina- \ntion if the conclusions of the different approaches \nagree. If the conclusions differ, that difference \nindicates a need for caution in interpreting the \ndata since some unusual site-specific circumstanc- \nes may be at work. The importance of this type \nof verification increases with the significance of \nthe decisions that must be made using the infor- \nmation obtained. In fact, the actual decision- \nmaking frameworks within which the compendium \nmethods are used often include this verification in \nthe concept of tiered testing. \nThe assessment methods presented in the \ncompendium are continually being refined and \nimproved. Additional methods are also being \ndeveloped. As these methods are developed and \nverified, they will be incorporated into future \nupdates of the compendium. \n1.2 OBJECTIVE \nThis document is a compendium of scientifi- \ncally valid and accepted methods that can be used \nto assess sediment quality and predict ecological \nimpacts. \nSome regulations require the use of certain \ntypes of tests (e.g., the Toxicity Characteristic \nLeaching Procedure under the Resource Conserva- \ntion and Recovery Act), criteria (e.g., the limita- \ntions in the London Dumping Convention), and \nprocedures (e.g., risk assessment under the Com- \nprehensive Environmental Response, Compensa- \ntion, and Liability Act). Additional guidance may \nbe issued in the future to provide direction when \naddressing sediment contamination under particu- \nlar regulatory programs including these, or other, \nrequired tests and approaches. These other test \nprocedures will not be presented in this compendi- \num, however, because the intent here is to provide the most useful overall measures or predictors of \necological impacts currently in use rather than \nprocedures that may have limited application \noutside of a particular regulatory framework \nNevertheless, many of the methods presented in \nthe compendium can be used as part of regulatory \nand/or remedial actions. \nGuidance on how to use the compendium \nmethods in a decision-making framework will be \nprovided in forthcoming documents and will likely \ninclude both chemical and biological methods in \na tiered hierarchical framework suitable for testing \nvarious hypotheses and endpoints. Currently such \na document has been prepared by the Sediment \nOversight Technical Committee to summarize \nexisting EPA decision-making processes for \nmanaging contaminated sediments (Managing \nContaminated Sediments: EPA Decision-Making \nProcesses, USEPA, 1590). The information \nprovided in the compendium on the relative \nstrengths and weaknesses of the different assess- \nment methods can provide assistance in selecting \nthe appropriate methods. \n1.3 OVERVIEW \nThe compendium is organized in the following \nmanner. The remainder of this chapter gives a \nbroad overview of the assessment methods in the \ncompendium. The information is presented in \ntabular form to facilitate comparisons between the \ndifferent methods. Chapter 2 outlines quality \nassurance/quality control, sampling, and analytical \nconsiderations that apply to all of the methods. \nMethod-specific information is also provided \nwhere the procedures differ from the general ones. \nThe remaining chapters give specific informa- \ntion on each of the sediment assessment methods. \nThe information is organized in a consistent \nmanner for each assessment method so the reader \ncan readily compare the relative strengths, weak- \nnesses, and applicability of each method in order \nto select the best method(s) for a specific situa- \ntion. The information provided for each method \nincludes the following: \n1-2 l How each method is currently used or \ncould be used; \nl A detailed description of the method, \nincluding types of data, equipment, and \nsampling procedures needed; \nl The applicability of the method to the \nprotection of wildlife and humans; \nl The utility of the method to produce \nnumeric sediment quality criteria; \nl The method\u2019s applicability to making \ndifferent types of sediment management \ndecisions; \nl The method\u2019s advantages, limitations, \ncosts, level of acceptance, and accuracy; \nl The degree to which the method is actual- \nly being used now; \nm How well it is validated; and \nl Its potential future uses. \nExtensive references are provided after each \nmethod in case any additional details are required. \nThe names, addresses, and telephone numbers of \nthe authors of the descriptions of each method are \nprovided to facilitate additional follow-up. Given \nthe limited level of detail in the compendium, use \nof these references is suggested for actual imple- \nmentation of the methodologies. \nThe 12 sediment assessment methods de- \nscribed in the compendium are summarized in \nTable 1-1. The assessment methods can be \ncategorized in many different ways. Differentia- \ntion could be made between numeric methods and \ndescriptive methods. Numeric methods are chemi- \ncal-specific and can be used to generate numerical \nsediment quality criteria (SQC) on a chemical-by- \nchemical basis. A potential drawback of descrip- \ntive methods is that they are not chemical-specific \nand cannot be used alone to generate numerical \nsediment quality criteria for particular chemicals. \nOn the other hand, descriptive methods can be used to directly assess the overall impact of all \nchemicals that may be present in a sediment, \nwhereas it is difficult to use the chemical-specific \nmethods to predict the combined effects of several \nchemicals. \nAnother differentiation that is often made \namong different sediment assessment methods is \nwhether they are based on the measurement of the \nconcentrations of chemicals of concern or on the \nmeasurement of biological impacts. For methods \nthat have ecological validity, this differentiation \nreally applies only to the practical implementation \nof the methods rather than to their scientific basis \nsince al1 ecologically valid methods must ultimate- \nly be based on an ability to predict or measure \nbiological effects. Many of the assessment meth- \nods use both chemical and biological testing or \nobservation. \nYet another differentiating factor is whether \nthe method uses interstitial water (pore water), \nelutriate, or bulk sediment (whole, including the \nsolids and interstitial water). This difference also \nrelates primarily to implementation rather than to \na substantive scientific difference since the chem- \nistry of interstitial water and that of the bulk \nsediment are closely linked Except for cuntami- \nnants that might be transferred directly by inges- \ntion, interstitial water is the medium through \nwhich the contaminants in the bulk sediment are \ntransferred to the affected organisms. \nSome of the assessment methods (which \nwould be more accurately characterized as ap- \nproaches) described in the compendium combine \nnumeric and descriptive measures. For example, \nthe Sediment Quality Triad (Triad) and Apparent \nEffects Threshold (AET) approaches employ bulk \nsediment toxicity testing, benthic community \nstructure analysis, and concentrations of sediment \ncontaminants. The Triad is both descriptive and \nnumeric, depending on its use. Typically, the \nTriad approach has been used in a descriptive \nmanner to identify contaminated sediments. It has \nalso been used, however, to generate criteria for \nseveral chemical contaminants. The International \nJoint Commission (DC) approach would be more \naccurately described as an assessment strategy \nsince it employs several of the other sediment \nassessment methods in a tiered, comprehensive \n13 \nSediment Classjfication Methods Compendium \nTable 1-l.

The Sediment-Testing Approach Used \nfor Ocean Disposal is the tiered, comprehen- \nsive testing procedure developed by EPA and the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USAGE) for \ndetermining the suitability of dredged material for \ndisposal at designated disposal sites. The proce- \ndure is specified in Evaluation ofDredged Materi- \nal Proposed for Ocean DQosaZ-Testing Manual, \ncommonly referred to as the 1991 Green Book \n(USEPA/USACE, 1991). \nTo facilitate the user\u2019s selection of the most \nsuitable sediment assessment method, Tables l-2 \nthrough l-5 highlight the major characteristics of \neach method. Information from individua1 chap- \nters that is useful in management decisions is \npresented in summary form and includes method \ndescriptions and uses, data and sampling required, \nability to generate numerical sediment quality \ncriteria, and outlook for future use. More pointed- \nly, the reader will learn what each method pre- \ndicts, what it assumes, how much it will cost, and \nwhy one might choose a particular method over \nanother for a specific situation. \nRegardless of which of the compendium \nmethods one uses, several considerations must be addressed: a sampling program needs to be \ndesigned; samples need to be collected, stared, \nand analyzed, and quality assuiance/quality control \nis needed throughout the process to determine the \nuncertainty associated with the results of the \nassessment. Sampling design and QAIQC issues \nwill be discussed in Chapter 2. \n1.4 REFERENCES \nBolton, S.H., RJ. Breteler, B.W. Vigon, JA. \nScanlon, and S.L Clark. 1985.

This chapter is \nintended only as a general guide to sediment \nsampling and should not be used as an instruction \nmanual for collecting samples. The subjects \nmentioned will not be dealt with in an exhaustive \nmanner. The reader is referred to the references \ncited in this chapter for more complete guidance \non the particular techniques. \n2.1 ESTABLISHING DATA QUALITY \nOBJECTIVES \nFundamental to the process of designing a \nstudy is the establishment of data quality objec- \ntives (DQOs). The most carefully collected and \nanalyzed data are of no use if the data collected \nare insufficient or of the wrong type. To avoid \neither of these and other potentially costly errors, \nEPA has initiated the use of the DQO Process. \nThe DQO Process is a management tool designed \nto help data users and data collectors design the \nbest sampling strategy to reach their objectives \nwhile minimizing resource requirements. It is a \nmultistep, systematic approach to data collection \nthat enables the manager to refine goals and \nobjectives and help answer the question, \u201cHow \nmuch data is enough?\u201d As the steps of the DQO \nProcess are followed, the decisions made in \nprevious steps should be reviewed to ensure \nconsistency and cohesiveness. \nThe first step in the process is to specify the \nproblem and identify limitations of time or re- \nsources on the data-collection effort. This process \nallows one to evaluate his or her current knowl- \nedge base of the problems and identify all avail- \nable resources. The next step is to identify what \ndecisions or activities will be made based on the data. The answer to this question is vital to \nensure the collection of the right type of data. \nThe decision goals should be as narrow in scope \nas possible, and considerable effort may be re- \nquired to define them properly. \nThe third step involves identifying all vari- \nables needed to make a decision. This step \nfocuses on eliminating the potential measurement \nor collection of data that may not actually be used \nin the decision-making process. The next step \nrequires the data collector to set or define the \nboundaries of the study, including the population, \nwhich could consist of people, objects, or media, \nand the boundaries on the population, including \nspace, time, and area. \nDeveloping a decision rule, or how the data \nwill be used and summarized, is the next step in \nthe process. This step involves describing how \nthe study results will be compiled or calculated \nand defining the decision rule in an \u201cIf . . . , then . ..\u201d \nformat. The statement should incorporate the \nstudy results as \u201cIf the results are this, then the \naction should be this.\u201d For example, \u201cIf PCB \nlevels in fish are greater than 2 ppm, then a fish \nconsumption advisory will be issued.\u201d This step, \nalong with the others, helps define the data collec- \ntion effort by identifying the data needed to fulfill \nthe decision rule. \nA very important step in the DQO Process is \nspecifying the limits of uncertainty acceptable in \nthe data. These limits can be expressed as accept- \nable false-positive and false-negative error rates \nfor the decision. These error rates must be based \non careful consideration of the consequences of \nincorrect conclusions being drawn from the data. \nThe definitions of false-positive and false-negative \nerrors vary with the decision being defined. If a \ndecision to take regulatory action is being made, \na possible false-negative error could result in no \naction being taken because incorrect data results \nindicated there was no problem. The opposite \ncould also occur, where a false positive error \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \nresults in regulatory action being taken when no \nproblem exists. It is essential that the potential \nconsequences to economic, health, ecological, \npolitical, and social issues be considered when \ndeciding on acceptable false-positive and false- \nnegative error rates. This step may involve the \nconsultation of a qualified statistician. \nFinally, all steps in the DQO Process should \nbe reviewed to design the most efficient sampling \nstudy. Considerations including cost, time, de- \nfined boundaries, the decision rule, and all other \nfactors defined and specified during the DQO \nProcess should be incorporated. \nOne can refer to \u201cPlanning Issues for Super- \nfund Site Remediation\u201d in Hazardous Material \nControl (Ryti and Neptune, 1991) for an excellent \nexample of applying the DQO Process to an actual \nsituation. \nQuality assurance and quality control are \nintegral components of every aspect of a pro- \ngram\u2019s activities. The collection of reliable data \nis contingent on the use of and adherence to a \ngood Quality Assurance Project Plan; the devel- \nopment of a sound sampling study is contingent \non the use of the DQO Process; and use and \nimplementation of the DQO Process is contingent \non a Quality Assurance Program Plan. \n2.2 SAMPLING DESIGN \n2.2.1 Test, Reference, and Control Sediments \nIn sediment quality evaluations, there is a \nsubstantial precedent for using comparisons \nbetween sites rather than comparison of testing \nresults to an independently set numerical bench- \nmark. This is the result of a number of factors \nincluding the standard procedures used in biologi- \ncal testing, the paucity of scientifically acceptable \nnumerical sediment quality criteria or standards, \nand the long-standing \u201cnondegradation\u201d philoso- \nphy used in evaluating the acceptability of \ndredged material for open-water disposal. The \ndegree of sediment contamination in a particular \narea is often evaluated by comparing the structure \nof benthic communities, levels of pollutants, or \nbioassay test results in sediments collected from the area being investigated with those. in the \nsurrounding area. The terms used to describe the \ndifferent sediments in the comparisons are lest \nsediments, control sediments, and reference \nsediments. \nAs used in sediment assays and assessments, \na test sediment is sampled from the area whose \nquality is being assessed. A control sediment is \na pristine (or nearly so) sediment, free from \nlocalized anthropogenic inputs of pollutants with \ncontamination present only because of inputs from \nthe global spread of pollutants (Lee et al., 1989). \nA control sediment is fully compatible with the \nneeds of the organisms used in the assay, is \nknown to not cause toxicity, and is used primarily \nto verify the health of the test organisms and the \nacceptability of the test conditions (USEPA/USA- \nCE, 1991). The control sediment may be artifi- \ncially prepared in order to achieve sufficient \nvolumes of a known and consistent quality for use \nin standard testing and for culturing test organisms \n(ASTM, 1990). \nA reference sediment, on the other hand, is \ncollected from a location that may contain low-to \nmoderate levels of pollutants resulting from both \nthe global inputs and some localized anthropogen- \nic sources, representing the background levels of \npollutants in an area (Lee et of., 1989). The \nreference sediment is to be as similar as possible \nto the test sediments in grain size, total organic \ncarbon (TOC), and other physical characteristics \n(Lee et al., 1989; USEPA/USACE, 1991; ASTM, \n1990). The physical environment of the reference \nsite should also be as similar as possible to that at \nthe sites where the test sediments will be collect- \ned. This is especially significant for benthic \ncommunity structure comparisons, since communi- \nty structure can be very significantly affected by \nwater depth, physical transport processes such as \nwaves and currents, sediment grain size, and the \npresence of organic debris. \nAs used in dredged material assessment, the \nresults of assays or evaluations on the test sediments \nare compared to those obtained from reference \nsediments to determine whether the test sediments \nare contaminated. In contrast, the results of assays \nor evaluations using the control sediments are \nusually compared only to past results using those \n2-2 \n2-QA/QC, SantpIing, and Analytical Casidtmtions \nsame control sediments to ensure that the testing \nwas free of some extraneous factors that may have \naffected the reliability of the test. Depending on the \nstudy objeaives, however, controls can also be used \nas a benchmark against which to compare test \nsediments to de(ermine the relative degree of con- \ntamination of sediments collt~ted from different \nsites (ASTM, 1990). \nA clear understanding of the end uses of the \ndata is essential in the establishment of an appro- \npriate sampling program. A cost-effective study \nfor a qualitative overview of potential contaminat- \ned sediment impacts will differ markedly from one \nwhose purpose is to make statistically-based \nnumerical comparisons with criteria or indexes, or \nto reference sites. \nSediment sampling programs are most often \nundertaken to achieve one or more of the follow- \ning objectives: \nB To fulfill a regulatory testing requirement: \nw To determine characteristic ambient lev- \nels; \nn To monitor trends in contamination levels; \nw To identify hot spots of contamination; or \nn To screen for potential problems. \nThese different objectives will lead to differ- \nent sampling designs. For example, a study for a \ndredging project may have a specific set of guide- \nlines on sampling frequency, sample site selection \nmethodology, and other parameters already deter- \nmined by existing specific guidance. The design \nfor a study to determine ambient levels will strive \nto obtain uniform, random coverage of an area \nthrough the collection of samples from a relatively \nlarge cumber of sites. The design for a study to \ntrack sediment contamination trends will expend \nits resources to sample fewer sites but more often. \nA study to identify hot spots would concentrate \nefforts on fewer sites within zones most likely to \nbe contaminated, while an initial screening study \nmight take very few, randomly distributed samples for analysis together with some \u201cobservation\u201d \nsamples to supplement the analytical results. \nAvailable information about the area to be \nsampled and its surroundings should be used in \ndetermining the final sample design. Knowledge \nabout bottom topography, currents, areas of dredg- \ning and the frequency of dredging, locations of \npoint and nonpoint sources of contaminants, \ndistribution of grain sizes, and other factors can \nprovide the basis for determining which of the \nsampling designs .to use (e.g., Are there reasons to \nexpect localized hot spots of contamination?) and \nwhere to place sampling locations (e.g., Which \nparts of the area are likely to be similar enough to \ngroup into the same strata?). Preliminary surveys \nof an area using depth-sounding and sediment- \nprofiling equipment can prove invaluable in \ndelineating vertical and horizontal distributions of \nsediments (IJF; 1988). This information can be \nhelpful in planning sediment sampling methods \n(grab samples or core samples) and sample site \nselection (grouping similar areas into strata, \nidentifying likely locations of hot spots). \nThe methods most often used for selecting the \nsample collection sites are haphazard, worst-case, \nrandom, stratified random, and exhaustive \n(Higgins, 1988). \n2.2.1.1 Haphazard \nThe haphazard method, whereby one selects \nsampling sites based on whim or ease of imple- \nmentation rather than science or knowledge, really \nreflects the lack of a design. This method has no \nvalidity and should not be used. \n2.2.1.2 Worst-Case \nThe worst-case sampling design is based on \nknowledge regarding the presence and distribution \nof potential sources of sediment contamination in \nan area. II is usually considered cost-effective as \nlong as the study objectives are being met. An \ninherent problem with this design is that it results \nin an incomplete characterization of an area and is \nnot statistically robust. However, it can be useful \nas an initial survey to determine the potential for \na contamination problem, which would be fol- \n2-3 \nSediment ClassjCication Methods Compendium \nlowed up with more complete sampling later, if \nneeded. The effectiveness of this technique \ndepends on the availability of reliable historical \ninformation on contamination, sources, bathyme- \ntry, currents, and other factors. \n2.2.X.3 Random \nThe random sampling design is most useful \nfor cases where little is known about the likely \ndistribution of sediment contamination or sources, \nor when available information indicates a high \ndegree of homogeneity in an area. The area to be \nsampled is divided using a grid system. Samples \nare distributed within the grid randomly, with each \nlocation having an equal probability of being \nsampled. The number of samples is selected \nstatistically based on the requirements of the \nsurvey and the acceptability of false-positive or \nfalse-negative resuIts. This design yields statisti- \ncally sound results. \n2.2.1.4 Stratijkd Random \nThe stratified random design is a variation on \nthe previous two designs. Available information \nis used to identify different zones that are likely to \nbe similar in degree of contamination or other \ncharacteristics. Samples sites are then randomly \nselected within the different zones. This design \nalso yields statistically reliable results. \n2.2.X.5 Exhaustive \nIn the exhaustive design, an area is subdivided \ninto equal-sized units, each of which is then \nsampled. This design yields a very complete \ncharacterization. However, this design is usually \nvery costly because of the large number of sam- \nples that need to be collected. \n2.2.2 Numbers of Samples \nStatistics can be used to determine the number \nof samples .needed. To use statistics in this way, \none needs to decide what comparisons will be \nniade with the resulting data and what will be the \ndesired statistical power of the comparisons (i.e., at what level of confidence will resulting differ- \nences be tested). In addition, one needs some \ninformation about the inherent environmental \nvariability in the area (i.e., the likelihood that an \nobserved difference is due to an actual difference \nin contamination rather than just the natural \nheterogeneity in sediment or benthic population \ncharacteristics in the area). There are many \ndifferent statistical approaches to estimating the \nnumber of samples required and to interpreting the \nresulting test results. Excellent reviews of statisti- \ncal designs and interpretation are given by Baudo \n(1990) for sediment physical and chemical testing \nand by Downing and Rigler (1984) for benthic \ncommunity structure evaluations. \nIn practice, constraints on resources often \npreclude the use of a purely statistical approach to \ndetermining the number of samples and some \nform of a cost-benefit approach is often used to \narrive at a reasonable compromise between statis- \ntical power and the cost of the study. One of the \nmajor advantages of the tiered approaches for \ntesting and assessment is the cost savings that \nresults when information is collected relatively \ninexpensively initially and additional resources are \nexpended only when the information collected \nthus far is insufficient to make a decision. \nGuidance on how to select a co&effective \napproach is usually provided in very general \nqualitative terms as to the factors that should be \nconsidered in arriving at a decision (USEPA/ \nUSACE, 1991; Higgins, 1988; Plumb, 1981). \nDecisions are largely subjective. However, re- \nsearchers at EPA\u2019s Environmental Research \nLaboratory (ERL)-Narragansett/Newport recently \ndeveloped a four-step procedure to determine the \noptimal cost-effective sampling scheme for marine \nbenthic community assessment (USEPA, undated). \nThe procedure begins with an initial limited \nsampling using two or more sampling schemes at \npaired sites (test and reference sites). \u2018Ihe \u201ccosts\u201d \nin time and money are assessed for each sampling \nscheme. Next, a statistical power analysis is \nconducted to calculate the number of replicate \nsamples needed to achieve a desired degree of \nstatistical \u201cpower\u201d for each sampling scheme. \nFinally, the power-cost efficiencies of the altema- \ntive sampling schemes are. calculated and the \n24 \n2-QA/QC, Sampling, and Analytical Considetatbns \noptimum scheme is selected as the one with the \nhighest power-cost efficiency. \n23 QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY \nCONTROL \nQuality assurance and quality control (QA/ \nQC) are essential to the production of environ- \nmental monitoring data of known and documented \nquality in a cost-effective manner. QA/QC should \nbe an integral part of the process of study design, \nexecution, and data evaluation and interpretation. \nAll EPA data-collection programs have imple- \nmented Quality Assurance Program Plans designed \nand overseen by their management to ensure the \nquality of all activities for which their organiza- \ntion is responsible. These programs address all \nquality assurance issues in regard to policy, \nplanning, review, and implementation. QA Pro- \nject Plans are a vital part of the QA Program Plan. \nA QA Project Plan is a project-specific guidance \ncompiled to encompass all aspects of the sam- \npling/analytical effort. The preparation of a QA \nProject Plan is often met with unnecessary trepida- \ntion. A QA Project Plan is simply a written \nrecord of the plans that must be made and fol- \nlowed in executing a study. A QA Project Plan \nprovides detailed documentation of all facets of \nhow and why a particular study will be undertak- \nen. The Plan also describes the alternative actions \nthat will be taken in the event that things do not \ngo according to the original plans. Once all of the \npurposes and procedures of the proposed study are \nrecorded in a QA Project Plan, the Plan can be \nimproved or modified, if needed, through reviews \nby persons knowledgeable about different aspects \nof the study (e.g., chemical analysis, sampling \nlogistics, navigational positioning, sample preser- \nvation techniques). \nBecause the QA Project Plan is a vital tool for \nthe datacollection process, it is essential that all \npersonnel involved in the project read and under- \nstand the Plan and that the Plan be available for \nreference throughout lhe project to ensure proper \nimplementation. \nQA Project Plans are important for legal as \nwell as scientific reasons. QA Project Plans are required for all EPA-associated projeds (EPA \nOrder 5360.1). QA Project Plans become part of \ncontracts that are issued to undertake studies (40 \nCFR, Part 15). Furthermore, nonadherence to the \nPlan could result in the data being unusable for \ncourt proceedings or regulatory decisions. \nThe QA Project Plan is just as important after \nthe study is completed and the data are being used \nto make an evaluation or decision. The Plan \nprovides the information needed to assess the \ndegree of confidence one can place in the data, as \nwell as the comparability of the data collected in \na particular study with those from another study. \nA common problem that managers and scientists \nhave with using existing data is not that the old \ndata are unreliable, but that the data are of un- \nknown reliability. \n23.1 QA/QC Terminology \nA number of important concepts and terms \nneed to be defined to develop an understanding of \nwhat makes up an adequate QA/QC program \n(USEPA, 1983; Delbert and Starks, 1985). \nAccumcy is defined as the difference between \na measured value and the assumed or expect- \ned value. Accuracy in percent is 100 minus \nthe total error, which is composed of bias and \nrandom errors. \nBias is the systematic distortion of a measure- \nment process that adversely affects the repres- \nentativeness of the results. Bias can result \nfrom the basic sampling design, the kind of \nequipment used to collect the samples, the \nsample-handling procedures, and poor recov- \nery of the analyte. Because bias is systematic, \nits magnitude can be predicted if proper QA \nprocedures are being used in the field and \nlaboratory. \nComparczbility is the measure of confidence \none has in being able to compare one data set \nwith another. Comparability is increased if \nsimilar field and laboratory methods were \nused and decreased if different or unknown \n(undocumented) methods were used. Canpa- \nrability between different laboratories can be \nevaluated through the use of inter-laboratory \n2-5 \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \ncomparisons, or \u201cround-robin\u201d studies, where- \nin standardized samples are analyzed by each \nof the participating laboratories. \nCompleteness is the amount of valid data \nobtained (i.e., that met QAfQC acceptance \ncriteria) compared to the planned amount. \nCompleteness is usually expressed as a per- \ncentage. \nDu& quiz&y refers to the sum of all features \nand characteristics of the data that determine \nits capability to satisfy the objectives of the \ndata collection. \nDu&a qua&y indicators are quantitative statis- \ntics and qualitative descriptors that are used to \ninterpret the degree of acceptability or utility \nof data to the user. Data quality indicators \ninclude bias, precision, accuracy, comparabili- \nty, completeness, and represenbtiveness. \nData quality objectives (DQO) are statements \nof the overa uncertainty that a decision- \nmaker is willing to accept in results or deci- \nsions derived from the data, and they provide \nthe framework for the data-collection effort. \nDuplicate samples are two samples taken \nfrom and representative of the same popula- \ntion and carried through all the same steps of \nsampling, storage, and analysis in an identical \nmanner. \nField blank is a clean sample (i.e., distilled \nwater) carried to the sampling site, exposed to \nsampling conditions, and returned to the \nlaboratory and treated as an environmental \nsample. Field blanks are used to try to assess \ncontamination problems caused by conditions \nin the field, including contamination of the \nsampling device, sample containers, shipping \ncontainers, etc. \nMeasurement error is the difference between \nthe true sample values and the reported values \nand can occur during analysis, data entry, \ndatabase manipulation, or other steps. Method sensitivitylmethod detection limit \ndefines the lower limits of reliable analysis of \na particular parameter inherent in the use of a \nparticular test method. \u2018Ihe method detection \nlimit is the minimum concentratioh of a \nsubstance that can be measured with 99 per- \ncent confidence that the analyte concentration \nis flea&x than zero in a particular medium (40 \nCFR Part 136, Appendix B). \nPrecision is the degree of consistency among \nduplicate/replicate measurements. \nQua& ussumnce is an integrated program \nfor ensuring the reiiability of monitoring and \nmeasurement data. It includes the wellde- \nfined plans and procedures for how to ensure \nthe production of sufficient data of known and \ndocumented quality, including monitoring how \nwell QC procedures are actually being imple- \nmented. \nQuality control is the routine application of \nprocedures for obtaining prescribed standards \nof performance in the monitoring and mea- \nsurement process. It is the actual implementa- \ntion of the QA plan, effected through mea- \nsurements of data quality througb the use of \nblanks, spikes, etc. Quality control consists of \nboth internal and external checks including \nrepetitive measurements, internal test samples, \ninterchange of technicians and equipment, use \nof independent methods to verify findings, \nexchange of samples and standards among \nlaboratories, and use of standard reference \nmaterials. \nRun&m error is nonsystematic (and, there- \nfore, unpredictable) error that can mr dur- \ning any part of the sample collection, han- \ndling, and analysis. Hopefully, random errors \nare normally distributed with a mean of zero \nso that the overall evaluation will not be \naffected even though individual measurements \nwill be affected. \nRepresentativeness is the degree to which the \ndata accurately and precisely represent the \n2-QA/QC, Sampling, and Analytical Considerations \nparameter or condition being sampled. Repre- \nsentativeness is affected by sampling design \n(e.g., number of samples, method of selecting \nsampling sites), as well as analytical sampling \naccuracy and precision. \nSampling error is the difference between the \nsampled value and the true value, and is a \nfunction of natural spatial and temporal vari- \nability and sampling design. It also includes \nerror due to improperly selected/collected \nsamples or improperly gathered measurements. \nSampling error is more difficult to control \nthan the other type of error, measurement \nerror, and typically accounts for most of the \ntotal error. \nUncertuinty is the total variability in sampling \nand analysis including systematic error (bias) \nand random error. \nDuplicates, spikes, and blanks are all used to \nassess the quality of the data, to identify any \nsystematic problems, and to isolate the sources of \nsuch problems. \n2.4 SOURCES AND SIGNIFICANCE OF \nMONITORING ERROR \nTo increase the accuracy, precision, and \nrepresentativeness of the data collected in a sedi- \nment assessment study, it is important to be aware \nof and minimize two types of error that can be \nintroduced into sediment contaminant concentra- \ntion data: bias and scatter. Sources of bias in \nsediment studies include the actual heterogeneity \nin the distribution of contaminants in the sedi- \nments, the sampling design (number of samples, \nmethod for selecting sampling sites), the sampling \nmethod, the sample preparation procedures, and \nthe testing methods. \nFactors that tend to make sediment contami- \nnants distribute themselves heterogeneously \ninclude the differences in the density of the bulk \ncontaminant (e.g., sinking versus floating); differ- \nences in the affinity of the contaminant for parti- cles as a function of particle size, organic carbon \ncontent, etc.; particle sorting as a function of \nwater currents and particle size; lateral mixing of \nwater and sediments as a function of flow or \ndistance downstream of the sources; resuspension; \nbioturbation; and biouptake. \nThe objective of a well-designed sampling \nprogram is to minimize the introduction of data \nartifacts associated with the sampling plan, sample \ncollection, sample preparation, and sample analy- \nsis while revealing the actual contaminant concen- \ntration profile in space as a function of time. A \nplan that requires preferential sampling of areas \nthat are devoid of aquatic life will likely be biased \ntoward high toxicant concentrations, resulting in \nan unrepresentative horizontal spatial sediment \ncontaminant profile. Artifactual variability can be \nintroduced if the number and size of the samples \nare inappropriate to the scale of the system under \ninvestigation, yet the sampling size has to be \nbalanced against cost. \nWith respect to bias due to sampling method, if \ncertain core samplers are used to quantify the \nvertical distribution of a sediment contaminant, for \nexample, the actual vertical profile is likely to be \ndistorted because the absolute vertical relationship of \ncontaminant concentrations is lost due to differential \ncompression of the sample during coring. Another \nexample of samphng method bias occurs when a \ngrab sampler is used to collect the surficial sediment \nsample. The potential disproportionate loss of fme \nparticles from the grab during the drop, closing, and \nwithdrawal phases of sampling can result in an \nunderquantification of the contaminant surticial \nconcentration if the contaminant is preferentially \nconcentrated on the fines. \nRegarding sample preparation bias, a sample \npreparation procedure that transforms, loses, or \ndestroys one member of a homologous series (e.g., \nPCBs, PCDDs, or PCDFs) will not only result in \nan underquantification of the total concentration \nfor that toxicant category, but will also misrepre- \nsent the relative proportions of the isomers. \nAnalytical method bias can result from the inabili- \nty to separate complex mixtures into individual \nconstituents (interference), thus resulting in the \nmisidentification or misquantification of a toxi- \ncant; from differences in the sensitivity of the \n2-7 \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \ndetector for a particular pollutant over the range of \nconcentrations encountered in the sediment (non- \nlinear responses); or from poor or varying recov- \nery of the analyte. \nAnalytical variability arises primarily from the \ncompounded uncertainty associated with the \ntolerance on each of the components and steps of \nthe wet or electronic methods of sample prepara- \ntion (aliquot selection, weighing, drying, grinding, \nsieving, etc.) and analysis. \n2.5 COMPONENTS OF A QUALITY \nASSURANCE PROJECI\u2019 PLAN \nAs mentioned previously, a QA Project Plan \nclearly documents the participants\u2019 responstbilities; \nwhat will be done; why it is being done; the \ndesired accuracy, precision, completeness, and \nrepresentativeness of the resulting data; who will \nreport what information to whom; and what will \nbe done in the event something goes wrong. \nRather than attempting to describe the actual \ncomponents of a QA Project Plan in any detail \nhere, an example of the table of contents from a \nrecent plan is presented in Figure 2-l. In addi- \ntion, actual QA Project Plans from projects similar \nto the one being planned can be extremely useful \nin suggesting the important issues to consider. \nFor detailed guidance on preparing QA Project \nPlans, one should refer to Interim Guidelines and \nSpeci@ations for Preparing Quality Assurance \nProject Plans (USEPA, 1980). Some good \nexamples of actual sediment assessment Quality \nAssurance Project Plans include Burton (1989), \nCkcelius (1990), and Valente and Schoenherr \n(1991). \n2.6 SAMPLE COLLECTION AND \nHANDLING \n2.6.1 Sampling for Physical and Chemical \nAnalyses \n2.6.1.X Sample Cdlection Meha \nThe most appropriate device for a specific \nstudy depends on the study objectives, sampling conditions, parameters to be analyzed, and cost-ef- \nfectiveness of the sampler. There are basically \nthree types of devices used to collect sediment \nsamples: dredges, grab samplers, and corers \n(Baudo, 1990). \nA died& is a vessel that is draggei3 across \nthe bottom of the surface being sampled, coliect- \ning a composite of surface sediments and associat- \ned benthic fauna. Dredge samplers are more \ncommonly use4i to sample sediments in marine \nwaters than in fresh water. This type of sampler \nis primarily used for collecting indigenous be&tic \nfauna rather than samples for analyses or assays. \nBecause the sample is mixed with the overlying \nwater, no pore water studies can be made of \ndredged samples. Additionally, because the walls \nof the dredge are typically nets, they ad as a sieve \nand only the coarser material is trapped, resulting \nin the loss of fme sediments and water-soluble \ncompounds (ASTM, 1990). Results of dredge \nsampling are considered qualitative in nature since \nit is difficult to determine the actual surface \nsampled by the dredge. \nGrab samplers have jaws that close by a \ntrigger mechanism upon impact with the bottom \nsurface. Grab samplers offer the advantage of \nbeing able to collect a large amount of material in \none sample, but they have the disadvantage of \ngiving an unpredictable depth of penetration. \nGrab samplers are recommended when sampling \nis being performed for routine dredging projects \nbecause the sediments are continually disrupted by \nmarine traffic, homogenizing the sediments that \nhave accumulated since the last dredging (Plumb, \n1981). \nA core sampler is basically a tube that is \ninserted into the sediment by various means to \nobtain a cylinder or box sample of material at \nknown depths. Corers can be simple, hand-oper- \nated devices used by scuba divers, or they can be \n2-QA/Qc, Sampling, and Analytical Cons&rations \nCover Page (w/Approval Signatures) \nTie Page \nIntroduction \nTable of Contents \nList of Tables \nList of Figures \nList of Appendices \nList of Acronyms and Abbreviations \nGiOSStlQf \n1 PROJECT DESCRIPTION \n1 .l introduction \n1.2 Project Scope \n1.3 Data Quality Objectives \n1.4 Sample Network Design and Rationale \n1.5 Project Implementation \n2 PROJECT ORGANlZATlON AND \nRESPONSlBlLlT\u2019f \n2.1 Organization \n2.2 Authority and Responsibility \n2.2.1 Project Oversight \n2.2.2 Field Activities \n2.2.3 Laboratory Analyses \n2.2.4 Other Regulatory Personnel \n2.3 Project Communication \n3 QUALITY ASSURANCE OBJECTIVES \n3.1 Quality Assurance Documents \n3.2 Project Quality Assurance Objectives \n3.3 Field Measurement Quality Objectives \n3.3.1 Navigation \n3.3.2 Sample Collection Parameters \n3.3.3 Water Column Measurements \n3.4 Laboratory Data Quality Objectives \n3.5 Macrobenthic Community Assessment \nQuality Assurance Objectives \n3.6 Computer Model Quality Assurance \nObjectives \n4 SAMPLE COLLECTION AND \nHANDLING PROCEDURES \n4.1 Sample Containers \n4.1 .l Volume and Type \n4.1.2 Quality Control and Storage 4.2 Sampling Procedures \n4.2.1 Selection and Decontamination of \nEquipment \n4.2.2 Sampling Methods \n4.2.3 Collection of Sample \n4.2.4 Sample Volume, Presewation, and \nHolding Times \n4.2.5 Fold-Generated Waste Disposal \n4.3 Sample Packaging and Shipment \n5 SAMPLE DQCmENTATlON AND CUSTODY \n5.1 Field Procedures \n5.1.1 Sample Labeling \n5.1.2 Field Logbooks \n5.1.3 Field Chain of Custody \n5.1.4 Transfer of Custody \n5.2 Laboratory Procedures \n5.2.1 Sample Scheduling and Management \n5.2.3 Sample Receipt and Handling \n5.2.4 Log Books and Chain of Custody \n5.2.5 Sample Disposal \n5.3 Final Evidence File \n5.3.1 Contents \n5.3.2 Custody Procedure \n6 CAUBRATION PROCEDURES AND \nFREQUENCY \n6.1 Field Measurements \n6.1 .l Records and Traceability of Standards \n6.1.2 Initial and Continuing Calibration \nProcedures \n6.1.3 Conditions to Trigger Recalibration \n6.2 Physical and Chemical Laboratory \nAnalyses of Sediment \n6.2.1 Records and Traceability of Standards \n6.2.2 Preparation and Storage of Standards \n6.2.3 Initial and Continuing Calibration \n.Procedure \n6.2.4 Conditions to Trigger Recalibration \n6.3 Biological Effects Tests -- Water Quality \nMonitoring \n6.3.1 Records and Traceability of Standards \n6.3.2 Initial and Continuing Calibration \nProcedure \n6.3.3 Conditions to Trigger Recalibration \nFigure 2-l.

A few types of \ncorers include a gravity corer, which uses weights \nattached to the head of the sampling tube to push \nthe tube into the sediment; a piston corer, which \nis similar to a gravity corer but also has a piston \ninside the tube that remains stationary during sedi- \nment penetration and creates a vacuum that helps \npull the sampler into the sediment; a vibra-corer, \nwhich is like a gravity corer except with a vibrat- \ning head attached to enhance penetration; and a \nmultiple corer, which is an array of plastic tubes \nattached to a frame, allowing for the collection of \nseveral samples at the same location. Because \ngravity cOrers can compact the sample and distort \nthe vertical profile, a piston corer or vibra-corer is \nrecommended to minimize sample compaction. \nThe corer that disturbs the sediments the least is \na box corer. Instead of being cylindrical, it is a \nlarge box-shaped sampler that is deployed inside \na frame. After the frame is brought to rest on the \nbottom, heavy weights lower the open-ended box \ninto the sediment. A bottom door then swings \nshut upon retrieval to prevent sample loss. The \nadvantages of the box corer include its ability to \ncollect a large amount of sample with the center \nof the sample virtually undisturbed. Corers are \nnot generally recommended for use in sandy sedi- \nments since they have difficulty retaining the \nsample upon withdrawal. \nA comparison of the general characteristics of \nvarious commonly used sediment-sampling devic- \nes for chemical, physical, and biological studies is \ngiven in Baudo (1990); Plumb (1981); Downing \nand Rigler (1984); and ASTM (1990). \n2.6.2 Sample Handling, Containers, \nPreservation, and Holding Times \n2.6.2. I General Requiremenf.s \nProper handling of the samples is essential to \npreserve the sample integrity and the validity of \nthe results. Mishandling of samples at any stage \nof the sample-collection process could distort \nanalytical results, wasting the effort and expense \nof the sampling survey. Some of the basic con- siderations in sediment sample handling include \nthe following (Plumb, 1981): \nn It is essential that noncontaminated sam- \npling devices are used and that obvious \nsources of contamination such as exhaust \nfumes from the collecting ship, lubricating \ndrilling fluids, and powder from surgical \ngloves be eliminated. \nm Sampling devices should be washed be- \ntween samples with an appropriate series \nof cleansers and solvents to prevent crow \ncontamination from one sample to the \nnext. \nl Analysis for different parameters requires \ndifferent storage containers to ensure \nnoncontamination and to prevent degra- \ndation of the sample. Basic rules for \ncontainers include using plastic or glass \ncontainers for metal analysis, glass con- \ntainers for organic analysis, and glass or \nplastic for inorganic analysis. Since no \nset guidelines have been determined for \nsediment sampling, a good general rule to \nfollow is to use containers recommended \nfor water testing. \n8 A reliable and identifiable sample-labeling \nprocess should be used. \nn Sampling containers should be filled to \ncapacity, allowing only enough air space \nfor possible expansion of the sample \nresulting from the preservation technique \n(e.g., freezing) to eliminate or greatly \nreduce oxidation of the sample (USEPA/- \nUSACE, 1991). Sample containers for \nvolatile organ& analyses should be filled \ncompletely, allowing no headspace. \nPreservation methods are intended to maintain \nthe integrity of the sample by limiting the deter& \nration or alteration of a specified parameter by \nhydrolysis, oxidation, and/or biological activity \nwhile the sample awaits analysis. Methods are \nbasically limited to pH control, chemical addition \nSediment CLrss$u&urr Methods Compntdium \nor fixation, sample extraction or isolation, or \ntemperature control. Preservation steps should be \ninitiated immediately after collection of the sample \nsince significant alteration of the sample can occur \nin the first few hours after sampling. Immediate- \nly after collection, sediment samples are typically \nkept on ice or refrigerated. Upon arrival at the \nlaboratory, samples are usually preserved by \ndrying, freezing, or cold storage (ASTM, 1990). \nThe type of preservation required will depend \non the parameters being tested. For example, if \nthe sediment is to be tested for both bulk metals \nand particle size, either two samples should be \ncoliected or the sample should be split, since it is \nrecommended that samples for bulk metal analysis \nbe preserved by dry ice and stored at less than \n-2O\u201dC, whereas samples to be analyzed for particle \nsize should be refrigerated at 4\u00b0C (USEPA/ \nUSACE, 1991). For this reason, it is essential to \nknow which tests are to be performed, or poten- \ntially performed, on the samples in advance to \nallow for additional sample collection or splitting \nof samples as needed to comply with differing \nsampling, handling, and preservation requirements. \nFreezing appears to be the generally preferred \nmethod for preserving sediment samples for most \nchemical analysis, although sediments to be used \nfor particle size determination, volatile organ@ \nand toxicity testing should not be frozen (ASTM, \n1990). \n2.6.2.2 Requirements for Specijic Analyses \nThere are basically four ways to analyze \nchemical and physical parameters of sediments: \nbulk analysis, standard elutriate test, fractionation \nprocedures, and physical analysis. Brief descrip- \ntions of these types of analyses follow, along with \nany special sample handling procedures, contain- \ners, or preservation techniques needed. \nBulk anafysis aflows one to evaluate the total \nconcentration of a parameter within a sediment \nsample or the toxicity of the whole sediment. \nMost chemical parameters are evaluated by bulk \nanalysis. In general, the coIlection container and \npreservation and storage method are dependent on \nthe parameter to be tested. Bulk analysis samples \ncan be stored wet, air-dried, or frozen. If trace organic constituents are to be analyzed, a glass \ncontainer should be used to store the sample. \nWhen preserving and storing samples, one needs \nto take into consideration that other parameters \ncould change as a result of oxidation, volatiliza- \ntion, or chemical instability (Plumb, 1981). \nEiutkte tes2s indicate the ability of chemical \nconstituents to migrate from the solid phase to the \nliquid phase. An elutriate sample is Prepared by \nmixing or shaking sediment and water in pre- \nscribed proportions for a prescribed period of time \nand separating the liquid fraction by fdtration \nand/or centrifugation. The liquid fraction, the \nelutriate, is then analyzed by methods used for \nanalysis of water samples. Sediments to undergo \nelutriate testing should be stored wet, at 4\u201dC, in \nairtight containers and should be tested as soon as \npossible following sample collection. If trace \norganic analyses are to be performed, glass con- \ntainers with Teflon lids are required for storage \n(Plumb, 1981). \nFmctionation procedures provide information \non the distrtbution of constituents. The samples \nare extracted multiple times using a series of \nextractants and procedures, thereby isolating \nspecific pollutants or classes of pollutants. Pore \nwater extraction is a form of fractionation where- \nby the interstitial water in the whole sediment \nsample is extracted by squeezing or centrifugation. \nThe resulting water sample can be used in chemi- \ncal and biological tests. To date, fractionation has \nbeen used primarily for research. As a result, \nmost agencies do not subject their sediment \nsamples to fractionation procedures (Plumb, 1981). \nHowever, some fractionation tests, such as the \ntoxicity identification evaluation (TIE), a fraction- \nation procedure to isolate the toxic component of \na sample, are beginning to be used to make \ndecisions regarding regulatory actions and remedi- \nal approaches since they can be used to assess \nwhich pollutants are responstble for the toxicity \nobserved in a sediment. Samples to be analyzed \nfor fractionation should be stored wet, at 4\u00b0C and \nin airtight containers. Testing procedures should \nstart as soon as possible after sample colledion \n(Plumb, 1981). \nfhysicul anuiysis provides information on \nparticle size, color, texture, and mineralogical \n2-12 \nwA/QC, Sampling, and Analyticai Cons&ations \ncharacterization and includes tests for cation \nexchange capacity, particle size, pH, temperature, \nsalinity, oxidation reduction potential, total volatile \nsolids, and specific gravity. Samples to undergo \nphysical analyses may be stored wet, at 4% or \nfrozen, depending on the parameter to be tested. \nSome of these parameters (e.g., pH) should be \nanalyzed immediately upor~ collection. \nThe 1991 Green Book (USEPAAJSACE, \n1991) suggests the use of a grab sampler or corer \nfor collection of sediment samples and offers the \nfollowing general guidelines for preservation and \nhandling and sample sizes needed for sediment \nsamples collected for chemical and physical \ntesting: \nBulk metals should be stored in nonreactive \ncontainers, such as high-density polyethylene, and \nanalyzed as soon as possible. \nBulk orgaaics, including PCBs, pesticides, \nand high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, should \nbe contained in solvent-rinsed glass jars with \nTeflon lids, preserved by dry ice, and stored at \nless than -20\u00b0C in the dark. The samples can be \nstored for up to 10 days. Approximately 475 mL \nof sample should be collected. \nSamples to be analyzed for total organic \ncarbon (TOC) should be preserved by dry ice and \nstored at less than -20\u00b0C. They can be kept for an \nundetermined amount of time. \nSediments for particle size testing should be \nkept refrigerated at 4\u00b0C in any sealed container \nand can be kept for an undetermined amount of \ntime. \n2.63 Minimum Parameters to Be Tested \nSampling efforts are performed with a variety \nof objectives in mind, and therefore the minimum \nchemical and physical parameter testing require- \nments vary between studies or programs. Howev- \ner, some chemical and physical parameters seem \nto be common to several programs. They include \nparticle or grain size, total organic carbon, heavy \nmetals, acid volatile sulfides, polycyclic aromatic \nhydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and \npesticides. Unionized ammonia must also be \nmeasured, taking into account its sensitivity to pH \nand temperature, both of which are affected by sample manipulation. When testing sediment \nsamples from estuarine or marine environments, \nthe analysis methods chosen must address salinity \nsince this can alter the analytical results (USEPA/- \nUSACE, 1991). \nParticle or grain size analysis is a physical \nparameter that determines the distribution of \nparticle sizes. Methods for particle size analysis \nare suggested in Folk (1%8), Buchanan (1984), \nPlumb (1981), ASTM (1990), and Te&a Tech \n(1985). Plumb (1981) suggests that analysis will \nusually require two or more methods, depending \non the range of particle sizes encountered. He \ngives a detailed account of the use of sieves in \nconjunction with electronic particle counters or \nsieves and pipet analysis. Testing and Reporting \nRequirements for Ocean Disposal of Dredge \nMaterial ofl Southern CaZ~omiu under Marine \nProtection, Research and Sanctuaries Act Section \n103 Permits (Ocean Dredged Material Disposal \nProgram, 1991) recommends the method given in \nPlumb (1981) for analysis of particle size. \nTotal organic carbon (TOC) is an important \nindicator of bioavailability for nonionic hydrophw \nbit organic pollutants. When analyzing for this \nparameter, it is essential that the sample be stored \nin a glass or plastic container and that all air \nbubbles be removed from the sample before it is \nsealed and stored. The method given in Plumb \n(1981) is commonly recommended (Tetra Tech, \n1985). Plumb (1981) suggests using sample \nignition, which uses a hydrochloric acid wash to \nseparate the inorganic and organic carbon, or \ndifferential combustion, which uses thermal \ncombustion to separate the two carbons by their \ndifferent combustion temperature ranges. The \n1991 Green Book recommends that the analytical \nmethod to test for TOC be based on higb-tempera- \nture combustion rather than on chemical oxidation. \nAdditionally, it recommends using sulfuric acid \nrather than hydrochloric acid rinse. Testing and \nReporting Requirements for Ocean Disposal of \nDredge Material off Sourhem California under \nMarine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act \nSection 103 Per?& recommends EPA Test \nMethod No. 9060 for TOC determinations. The \nmethod recommended by EPA for use in apply- \ning organic carbon-normalized sediment quality \n2-13 \nSediment Classjtiurtion Methods Compendium \ncriteria for nonionic hydrophobic organic chemi- \ncals uses catalytic combustion and nondispersive \ninfrared detection (Leonard, 1991). \nMetak are found naturally occurring in the \ncavironrnent, but an excess of metals can be an \nindication of anthropogenic contamination. The \nmost commonly used method to analyze sediments \nfor metals is atomic absorption spectrophotometry. \nPlumb (1981) details the use of the direct-flame \natomic absorption method for all metals except \narsenic, mercury, and selenium. For these metals, \nhe recommends using arsine generation, cold \nvapor technique, and digestion/flameless atomic \nabsorption or hydride generation, respectively. \nThe 1991 Green Book points out that the concen- \ntration of salt in marine or estuarine samples may \ncause interference in analysis for metals. There- \nfore, the approach of an acid digestion followed \nby atomic absorption spectroscopy should be \ncoupled with an appropriate technique to control \nthis interference. The 1991 Green Book recom- \nmends USEPA (1986) for analysis of mercury and \nEPRI (1986) for (he analysis of selenium and \narsenic. Testing and Reporting Requirements for \nOcean Disposal of Dredge Material ofi Southern \nCalifornia under Marine Protection, Research and \nSanctuaries Act Section 103 Permits recommends \nthe following EPA Test Methods: cadmium (Nos. \n7130, 7131); hexavalent chromium (Nos. 7190, \n7191); copper (No. 7210); lead (Nos. 7420,742l); \nmercury (No. 7471); nickel (No. 7520); selenium \n(Nos. 7740,7741); silver (No. 7760); and zinc \n(No. 7950). \nAcid volatile sulfides (AVS) have been found \nto be closely related to the toxicity of sediment- \nassociated metals (Di Toro et al., 1990). AVS \nhave been found to be important in binding \npotentially bioavailable metals, thereby reducing \ntheir toxicity. The approved method is given in \nUSEPA (1991). \nPolyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are \nsemivolatile organic priority pollutants, a number \nof which are potential carcinogens. Plumb (1981) \ndetails the methods of methanol extraction/W \nanalysis and ethanol extraction/UV spectrophotom- \nttry to analyze for this parameter. Testing und \nRep&g Requirements for Ocean Disposal of \nDredge Material off Southern California under Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act \nSection 103 Permits recommends EPA Test \nMethod Nos. 8100,825O and 8270 for analysis of \nPAHs. \nPolycblorinated blphenyk (FCB) are chlori- \nnated organic compounds that were once used for \nnumerous purposes including as a dielectric fluid \nin electrical transformers. Desirable properties of \nPCBs include low flammability, nonconductivity, \nand nonreactivity. However, PCBs do not break \ndown readily and they biticcumulate in the \nenvironment. The 1991 Green Book offers gas \nduomatography/electron-capture detection (GC/ \nECD) methods as the primary tool for the analysis \nof PCBs, or the use of GC/MS using selected ion \nmonitoring (SIM). They do not recommend the \ntraditional methods of PCB analysis, which quan- \ntify PCBs as arochlor mixtures. Testing and \nReporting Requirements for Ocean Disposal of \nDredge Material ofl Southern Califontia under \nMarine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries act \nSection 103 Permits recommends the use of the \nmethods described in Tetra Tech (1986) and \nNOAA (1989) for analysis of PCBs. \nPesticides are man-made compounds pre- \ndominantly used in agriculture to control crop \ndamaging insects. Some pesticides, especially \nhalogenated compounds, persist in the environ- \nment and can contaminate the food chain. Plumb \n(1981) details the method of bexane extraction in \npreparation for testing for organophospborus \npesticides. The 1991 Green Book recommends \nusing GC/ECD or GC/MS to analyze for chiori- \nnated pesticides. Testing and Reporting Require- \nments for Ocean Disposal of Dredge Material off \nSouthern California under Marine Protect& \nResearch and Sanctuaries Act Section IO3 Permits \nrecommends EPA Test Method No. 8080 to \nanalyze for pesticides. \nFor analyses of volatile organic pollutants \nand semivolatile organic pollutants, the 1991 \nGreen Book recommends the methods descrii \n\u2018by Tetra Tech (1986), which should always \ninclude the use of capillary-column GC or GC&fS \ntechniques. For volatiles, a purge-and-trap method \nis used, followed by GUMS analysis accmiing to \nU.S. EPA Method 624 or U.S. EPA Method 1624, \nRev. B, Ref. 3 (Tetra Tech, 1986). \n2-14 2-QA/QC, Sumpiing, and Analytical Considerations \nAs stated previously, the minimum set of \nparameters tested in sediments varies and is based \non the sampling objectives of the program. Listed \nbelow are several examples of minimum data sets \nrequired by specific programs. \nThe 1991 Green Book recommends that all \nsediment samples be analyzed for TOC, PAHs, \ngrain size, total solids/water content, and specific \ngravity. The remaining parameters to be sampled \nare compiled from the priority pollutants list based \non historical testing data, potential contaminants \ndue to known industries in the area, and a general \nknowledge of the area to be sampled. \nTesting and Reporting Requirements for \nOcean Disposal of Dredge Material oflSourhem \nCalifornia under Marine Protection, Research and \nSanctuaries Act Section 103 Permits has very \nspecific parameters and methods required for \nmaterials to be disposed of off the coast. Re- \nquired analyses for physical parameters include \ngrain size, total solidWater content, and specific \ngravity. Chemical analyses includes 9 metals, \nammonia, arsenic, total sulfides, acid volatized \nsulfides (AVS), 11 pesticides including total pesti- \ncides, 9 organic compounds, all PCB congeners, \nindividual totals of tetra-, penta- and hexa-chloro- \nbiphenyl isomers, and 17 PAHs. \nThe EPA Environmental Monitoring and \nAssessment Program -Near Coastal (EMAP-NC) \nestablished guidelines identified in itsNear Coast- \nal Program Plan for 1990: Esluaries (Holland, \n1990) for sediment sampling for determination of \ncontaminant levels. They include sample collec- \ntion by means of a Young-modified Van Veen \ngrab and, initially, analyzing the NOAA Status \nand Trends suite of contaminants, which include \nchlorinated pesticides, PCBs, PAHs, major ele- \nments, and toxic metals. EMAP-NC, with the \nassistance of other programs, plans to refine the \nlist of contaminants to include pesticides and \nherbicides and other toxic chemicals. \n2.6.4 Sampling for Benthic Community \nStructure in Fresh Water \nMacrobenthic organisms play an important \nrole in marine, estuarine, and freshwater lotic and \nlentic ecosystems. As major secondary con- sumers, they represent an important linkage \nbetween primary producers and higher trophic \nlevels for both planktonic and detritus-based food \nwebs. They are a significant food source for \njuvenile fish and crustaceans and may improve \nwater quality by filter-feeding of particulate matter \n(Holland, 1990). Benthic populations also repre- \nsent diverse taxa and can seme as sentinels for \nenvironmental stress. Benthic organisms access \nall aspects of the aquatic habitat with varying \nfeeding strategies, reproductive modes, life history \ncharaderisks, and physiological tolerances to \nenvironmental conditions. Most benthic organ- \nisms have limited mobility and cannot avoid \nenvironmental stressors. As a result, the responses \nof some species serve as indicators of changes in \nsediment quality (Holland, 1990). This section \nwill detail specific procedures and precautions \nnecessary for proper conduct of benthic sample \ncollection and handling in freshwater, marine, and \nestuarine ecosystems. \n2.6.4.1 Sample Collection Metho& \nIt is helpful to consult Macroinvertebrati \nField and Laboratory Methods for Evaluating the \nBiological Integrity ofsurface Waters (Klemm et. \naL, 1990), which thoroughly addresses methodolo- \ngY. State environmental regulatory programs \nshould have a Quality Assurance Program Plan \ndescribing the field methods and standard operat- \ning procedures for collecting and evaluating \nbenthic maaoinvertebrates. This information \nshould be obtained to ensure acceptance and \ncomparability of study results with those obtained \nby the state agency. If this information is not \navailable, then field methods and standard operat- \ning procedures from other existing programs \nshould be used. \nIn soft freshwater sediments, the most com- \nmon method used to collect benthos is with a grab \nsampler such as a Ponar (15 x 15 an or 23 x 23 \nan) or Ekman grab sampler (15 x 15 cm, 23 x 23 \nan, or 30 x 30 cm), each of which provides a \nquantitative sample based on the surface area of \nthe sampler. The smaller of the sampler sizes are \nmost\u2019 commonly used for freshwater studies \nbe-cause of their relative ease of manipulation. \nSe&rent Classification Methods Compendium \nThe Ekman grab sampler is not as effective in \nareas of vegetative debris but is much lighter than \nthe Ponar and easier to use in softer substrates. \nArtificial substrates (Hester-Dendy using several \n3-inch plates and spacers attached by an eyebolt, \nor substrate/rock-filled baskets) provide consistent \nhabitat for the benthos to colonize in both soft- \nbottomed and stony areas. Artificial substrates \ncan be used in almost any water body and have \nbeen successfully used to standardize results \ndespite habitat differences (Ohio EPA, 1989; \nRosenberg and Resh, 1982; and Resh and Jackson, \n1991). \nA variety of methods for sampling benthos in \nhard-bottomed lotic systems are available, includ- \ning artificial substrates. If quantification by \nsediment or sampler surface area is needed, a \nSurber-type square-foot sampler with a Standard \n#30-mesh (0.589~mm openings) can be used \n(Klemm et al., 1990). The traveling kick-net (or \ndip-net) method, also using a #30-mesh net, can \nbe used to quantify the sample collected by the \namount of time spent sampling and the approxi- \nmate surface area sampled (Pollard, 1981; Pollard \nand Kinney, 1979). The Surber-type and kick \nmethods can each be used to provide consistent, \nreproducible samples, but both are limited to \nwadable streams. The Surber sampler\u2019s optimal \neffectiveness is limited to riffles, whereas kick-net \nor dip-net samplers can be effectively used in all \navailable habitats. Although dip-net samplers \nhave been effectively used to sample riffles and \nother relatively shallow habitats to determine taxa \nrichness, presence of indicator organisms, relative \nabundances, similarity between sites, and other \ninformation, they do not provide definitive esti- \nmates of the number of individuals or biomass per \nsurface area. \n2.6.4.2 Sample Handling and Preservation \nThe following decisions will need to be made \nonce the sample collection method is chosen: \n(1) whether samples will be picked from debris \nand sorted in the field, (2) which preservative \nshould be used, (3) whether a stain (rose bengal) \nor other material will be added to the sample to facilitate separating the organisms from debris, \n(4) the type of sample containers and labeling of \nthe containers required, and (s) the mode of \ntransportation of the samples to their destination. \nMany of these decisions are based on professional \npreference or the required logistics of the study. \nSorting of the benthos from debris and preser- \nvation are fully discussed by Klemm ef al. (1990). \nAmerican Public Health Association et al. (1989) \nand Klemm r~ al. (1990) defmed the benthos by \nwhat is retained cm a standard #30 sieve. How- \never, some types of Chironomidae and other small \nbenthos pass through a #30-mesh sieve but are \nretained by a #NJ-mesh sieve. It has been recom- \nmended that samples should fist be passed \nthrough a #3CLmesh sieve. Then the materials \nwashed through should be passed through a #4O- \nmesh sieve, and the materials retained in both \nsieves should be sorted (Ohio EPA, 1989). Once \nthe material is washed through the sieves, the \norganisms should be separated from the vegetation \nand other debris in a white enamel pan. As the \nmaterials are separated, the organisms can be \nplaced in different vials for the major taxa. \nPreservation with either formalin or 70 percent \nethanol is common. Although formalin is an \nexcellent fmative, the human health concerns \nassociated with its use require extreme caution and \nadequate ventilation. Many programs rely on 70 \npercent ethanol as a fixative and preservative. \nA practical technical reference that. details \nprocedures for cost-effective biological assess- \nments of lotic systems has been developed. Rapid \nBioassessment Protocols for Use in Streams and \nRivers: Benthic Macroinwrtebrates and Firh \n(Plafkin et al., 1989) presents three benthic rapid \nbioassessment protocois (RBPs) and two fish \nRBPs, with a progressive order of increasing rigor \nin evaluation within each series for each class of \norganisms. \nThe RBPs are based on integrated assessments \nthat compare physical conditions of habitat (e.g., \nphysical structure, flow regime) and biolo@a.l \nmeasures of reference conditions. These reference \nconditions are derived after systematic monitoring \nof sites that represent the natural range of var& \ntion. in water chemistry, habitat, and biological \ncondition. \n2-16 \nZ-QA/QC, Sampling, and Analytical Cons&rations \nThe functional and structural components \nevaluated for aquatic communities comprise eight \nmetrics for benthic RBPs and 12 metrics for the \nfish RBPs. Examples of metrics for benthic \ncommunities include the following: taxa richness, \nthe modified Helsenhoff Biotic Index (summarizes \noverall pollution tolerance of the benthic arthropod \ncommunity with a single ,value; this index was \nmodified to include nonarthropod species as well), \nratio of scraper and filtering collector functional \nfeeding groups, ratios of the number of organisms \nin the EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and \nTrichoptera) to the number of Chironomidae \npresent, and community similarity indexes. The \nfish protocol is based on the index of biotic \nintegrity (IBI) or a fish community assessment \napproach developed by Karr et al. (1981). As \nwith the approach of metrics in the benthic evalu- \nations, the metrics of the fish protocol represent \ndiffering sensitivities. \n2.6.5 Sampling for Benthic Community \nStructure in Marine and Estuarine \nWaters \nHistorically, regional monitoring programs \nhave used benthic community studies as an effec- \ntive indicator of the extent of pollution impacts on \nmarine and estuarine ecosystems, as well as the \neffectiveness of management actions. In addition, \ninformation on changes in benthic population and \ncommunity parameters due to sediment character- \nistics can be used to distinguish natural variation \nfrom changes due to human activities (Holland, \n1990). \n2.6.5.1 Sample Colkction Methods \nThree grab samples are collected for benthic \nspecies composition, abundance, and biomass. \nAdditional sediment grabs are collected for chemi- \ncal analyses and for use in acute toxicity tests. To \nminimize the possibility of biasing results, benthic \nbiology grabs should not be coIlected consecutive- \nly, but rather interspersed among the chemis- \ntry/toxicity grabs. While a biology grab is being \nprocessed (sieved), grabs should be colleckd for \nchemistry/toxicity (Holland, 1990). A \u2018& m\u2019, stainless steel, Young-modified Van \nVeen grab sampler may be used to collect sedi- \nments for benthic analyses. The sampler is con- \nstructed entirely of stainless steel and has been \ncoated with Kynar (similar to Teflon) and is, \ntherefore, appropriate for collecting sediment \nsamples for both biological and chemical analyses. \nlhe top of the sampler is hinged to allow for the \nremoval of the top layer of sediment for chemical \nand toxicity analyses. This gear is relatively easy \nto operate and requires little specialized training. \nTo minimize the chance of sampling the exact \nsame location lwice, the boat should be moved \n5 meters downstream after three grabs have been \ntaken, whether successful or not (Holland, 1990). \n2.6.5.2 Sample Handling and Preservation \nGrab samples to be used in the assessment of \nmacroinvertebrate communities are processed by \nfirst extracting a core sample from the sampler. \nThe depth of sediment at the middle of the sam- \npler should be at least 7 an. Descriptive informa- \ntion on the grab is recorded. The depth to the \nblack layer of sediment within the core, the redox \npotential discontinuity (RPD), is measured in the \nfield. The sample is then extruded from the core \ntube to fill a whirl pat bag, labeled, and recorded. \nThe sample should be refrigerated at 4\u201dC, not \nfrozen (Holland, 1990). \nThe remainder of the grab is processed for \nbenthic community analysis. The sediments are \ntransferred into a basin and then into a O&run \nmesh sieve. The sieve is agitated to wash away \nsediments and leave organisms, detritus, sand \nparticles, and pebbles larger than 0.5 mm. A \ngentle flow of water over the sample is acceptable, \nbut forceful jets of water should be avoided \nbecause they can cause mechanical damage to \nfauna. The organisms are rinsed and transferred \nfrom the sieve into a jar and covered in seawater \nwith MgCl added. This \u201crelaxes\u201d the organisms, \nreducing damage from addition of the preservative \n(Holland, 1990). Ten percent buffered formalin is \nused to fii and preserve samples. After 30 min- \nutes in the relaxant, formalin with a small amount \nof borax should be added to each sample jar. The \njar is filled to the rim with seawater to eliminate \n2-17 \nScdimmf Classification Me&n& Compendium \nany air space, eliminating the problem of organ- \nisms sticking to the cap during shipment. Prior to \nsieving the next sample, the sieve is rinsed and \nbrushed thoroughly to prevent cross-contamination \nof samples. \n2.6.6 Sampling for Bioassays and Toxidty \nTeSting \nEnvironmental impacts on marine ecosystems \nare primarily assessed and monitored using the \ntools outlined in the 1991 Green Book. The 1991 \nGreen Book is used to make decisions regarding \nthe suitability of dredged material for ocean \ndumping. EPA and the USACE have shown that \nthe greatest potential for environmental impact \nfrom dredged material disposal is on the benthic \nenvironment since benthic organisms burrow into \nand are exposed to sediments and associated \ncontaminants for extended periods of time. The \n1991 Green Book uses whole sediment bioassays \nto evaluate potential impacts of dredged sediments \nand, in concert with the identification of contami- \nnants of concern through chemical analysis, serves \nto determine the extent and type of bioavailability. \nIn addition, sediment toxicity tests can be used to \nassess spatial and temporal changes in toxicity in \ncontaminated areas, rank sediments based on their \ntoxicity to benthic organisms, and define cleanup \ngoals for contaminated areas. This section will \nhighlight some of the collection and handling \nmethods of sediments for toxicity testing and \nwhole sediment bioassays. \n2.6.6.1 Sample Collection, Handling, and \nPreservation \nThe sediment environment is composed of \nmany microenvironments, redox gradients, and \ninteracting physicochemical and biological pro- \ncesses. Many of these characteristics influence \nsediment toxicity and bioavailability to benthic \nand planktonic organisms, microbial degradation, \nand chemical sorption. Maintaining the integrity \nof a sediment sample during its removal, transport, \nstorage, and testing in the laboratory is extremely \ndifficult. Any disruption of this environment \ncomplicates interpretations of treatment effects, causative factors, and in situ comparisons (ASTM, \n1990). \nSample handling, prmation, and storage \ntechniques have to be designed to minimize any \nchanges in composition of the sample bJ retarding \nchemical and/or biological activity and by avoid- \ning contamination. Sufficient sample volume \nmust be collected to perfom~ the necessary analy- \nses, partition the samples for respective storage \nrequirements, and archive portions of the sample \nfor possible later analysis. Core sampling is \nrecommended to best maintain the integrity of the \nsediment for studies of sediment toxicity, inter- \nstitial waters, microbiological processes, and \nchemical fate. Subsampling, cornpositing, or \nhomogenization of sediment samples may be \nnecessary depending on the study objectives. \nSubsamples of the inner core area may be taken \nsince this area is more likely to retain its integrity \nand depth profile and not be contaminated by the \nsampler. The loss of sediment integrity and depth \nprofile is an important consideration, as are cbang- \nes in chemical speciation through oxidation and \nreduction resulting in volatilization, sorption, or \ndesorption; changes in biological activity; com- \npleteness of mixing; and sampling container \nwntamination (ASTM, 1990). \nSubsamples of the top 1 or 2 an may be \ncollected with a nonreactive sampling tool (e.g., \npolytetrafluoroethylene (PTF)-lined calibration \nscoop). Some studies may require a composite of \nsingle sediment samples, which usually consist of \nthree to five grab samples. Subsamples should be \ncollected with a Teflon paddle, placed in a nonre- \nactive bowl or pan, and stirred until the texture \nand color appear uniform. The sediments should \nbe removed and partitioned for chemical and AVS \nanalysis. Samples should completely fill the \nstorage containers, leaving no airspace. If the \nsample is to be frozen, just enough air space \nshould be allowed for expansion to take place. \nThe labeling system should be tested prior to use \nin the field, making sure that labels can withstand \nsoaking, drying, and freezing without becoming \ndetached or illegible (USEPA/USACE, 1991). \nMaintaining clean and uncontaminated sam- \npling equipment between samples is necessary. It \nis important to clean the sampling device, scoop, \n2-D \n2caA/Qc, Sampling, and Analytical Considerations \nspatula, and/or mixing bowls between sites. A \nsuggested cleaning procedure includes a soap-and- \nwater wash followed by an organic solvent rinse \n(ASTM, 1990). \nThe choice of sample containers for sediment \nshould consider the type of sediment, storage time, \nchemical sorption, and sample composition. For \nsediments containing organics, brown borosilicate \nglass containers with Teflon lid liners are optimal, \nwhereas plastic or polycarbonate containers are \nrecommended for metal-containing sediments. \nPTF or high-density polyethylene containers are \nrelatively inert and are suggested for use with \nsamples contaminated with multiple chemical \ntypes (ASTM, 1990). \nSediment samples for biological testing should \nbe press-sieved through a l-mm mesh screen to \nremove all living organisms from the sediment \nprior to testing. Other matter retained on the \nscreen with the organisms, such as shell frag- \nments, gravel, and debris, should be recorded and \ndiscarded. Sediment samples for use in bioassays \nshould be well mixed. \nSince the first few hours are the most critical \nto changes in the sample, preservation steps \nshould be taken immediately upon sediment \ncollection. There is no universal preservation or \nstorage technique, and a technique for one group \nof analyses may interfere with other analyses. \nProblems can be overcome by collecting sufficient \nsample volume to use specific preservation or \nstorage techniques for specific analytes or tests on \nsubsamples. Preservation, whether by refrig- \neration, freezing, or addition of chemicals, should \nbe accomplished in the field whenever possible. \nIf final preservation techniques cannot be imple- \nmented in the field, samples should be temporarily \npreserved in a manner that retains the integrity of \nthe sample. Sediment samples for biological \nanalysis should be preserved at 4\u201dC, never frozen \nor dried. Field refrigeration is easily accom- \nplished with coolers and ice; however, samples \nshould be segregated from melting ice or cooling \nwater. \nStorage containers can be the same as the \ntransport containers, and where sediments contain \nvolatile compounds, transport and storage should \nbe in airtight PTF or glass containers with PTF- lined screw caps. Exposure of sediments to air \nshould also be prevented in the handling of AVS-- \ncontaining sediments. AVS is the reactive sulfide \npool that can reduce metal toxicity by binding \nmetals in anoxic sediments. Oxidation of these \nsediments can either increase toxicity by disassoci- \nation of the AVS-metal complex and precipitation \nof the metal species, or reduce toxicity if the \nAVS-metal complex should volatilize (ASTM, \n1990). \nIt has been found that sediments can be stored \nat \u20184\u00b0C without significant alterations in toxicity. \nCompletion of testing within a 2-week storage \nperiod is recommended, but limits on storage \ntime will depend on sediment and contaminant \ncharacteristics (ASTM, 1990). \n2.7 REFERENCES \nAmerican Public Health Association, American \nWater Works Association, and the Water \nPollution Control Federation. 1989.

The bulk sediment toxicity ap- \nproach is a descriptive method and cannot be \nused by itself to generate sediment quality crite- \nria. \n3.1 SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS \n3.1.1 Current Use \nSediment toxicity testing has been applied in \ndredged material disposal permit and other \nregulatory programs in the following ways \n(USEPA/USACE, 1991). \nn To determine potential biological hazards \nof dredged material intended for disposal \nin an aquatic environment; \nn To evaluate the effectiveness of various \ndredged material management actions; \nn To indicate the spatial distribution of \ntoxicity in contaminated areas, the rela- \ntive degree of toxicity, and the changes \nin toxicity along a gradient of pollution \nor with respect to distance from pollutant \nsources (Scott and Redmond, 1989; \nSwartz et al., 1982, 1985b); \n\u2022 To reveal temporal changes in toxicity \n(i.e., by sampling the same locations over time or by assaying layers of buried \nsediment in core samples) (Swartz et al., \n1986, 1991); \n\u2022 To reveal hot spots of contaminated sedi- \nment for further investigation (Chapman, \n1986); and \n\u2022 To rank sediments based on toxicity to \nbenthic organisms and to define cleanup \nboundaries of small or large problem \nareas of contaminated sediment. \nBSTT integrates interactions among complex \nmixtures of contaminants that may be present in \nthe field. Many classes of chemical contami- \nnants, including metals, polycyclic aromatic \nhydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls \n(PCBs), dioxins, and chlorinated pesticides can \ncontribute to toxicity in effluents and sediments \n(Chapman et al., 1982). The BSTT measures the \ntotal toxic effect of all contaminants, regardless \nof their physical and chemical composition. \n3.1.2 Potential Use \nBy itself, BSTT cannot generate chemical- \nspecific toxic effects data, but it can determine \ntoxicity. Used in conjunction with toxicity \nidentification evaluation procedures (Ankley et \nal., 1990) such as those described in Chapters 5, \n10, and 11, BSTT could help identify causal \ntoxicants. To generate sediment quality criteria, \nthe procedure must be combined with other \nmethods of estimating sediment quality such as \nthe Triad (Chapman, 1986b; Chapman et al., \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \n1987; see Chapter 10) and the Apparent Effects \nThreshold (AET) approach (Tetra Tech, 1986; \nPTI, 1988; see Chapter 11). BSTT will be most \nvaluable in verifying other methods used to \ndevelop sediment quality criteria. \n3.2 DESCRIPTION \n3.2.1 Description of Methods \nThe toxicological approach involves exposing \ntest organisms to sediments. The chemical com- \nposition of the sediments, which may be complex, \nneed not be known. At the end of a specified \ntime period, the response of the test organisms is \nexamined in relation to a specified biological \nendpoint (e.g., mortality, growth, reproduction, \ncytotoxicity, alterations in development or respira- \ntion rate). Results are then statistically compared \nwith control and reference sediment results to \nestimate sediment toxicity. \n3.2.1.1 Objectives and Assumptions \nThe objective of BSTT is to derive toxicity \ndata that can be used to predict whether the test \nsediment will be harmful to benthic biota. It is \nassumed that the behavior of chemicals in test \nsediments in the laboratory is similar to that in \nnatural in situ sediments. The effects of various \ninteractions (e.g., synergism, additivity, antagon- \nism) among chemicals in the field or in dredged \nmaterials can be predicted from laboratory results \nwithout measuring total or bioavailable concen- \ntrations of potentially hundreds of contaminants in \nthe test sediment (Swartz et al., 1989) and without \na priori knowledge of specific pathways of inter- \naction between sediments and test organisms \n(Kemp and Swartz, 1989). One of the strengths \nof this test is to integrate the effects of all contam- \ninants. However, the effect of individual contami- \nnants cannot be determined by BSTT, therefore \nlimiting its use in source control. This method \ncan be used for all classes of sediments and any \nchemical contaminants, but not to answer cause- \nand-effect questions. 3.2.1.2 Level of Effort \nImplementation of this procedure requires a \nmoderate amount of laboratory effort. A variety \nof toxicity test procedures (see Methods below) \nhave been developed and are fairly straightforward \nand well documented. \n3.2.1.2.1 Type of Sampling Required \nIt is recommended that bulk sediments be \ncollected for analysis of total solids, acid volatile \nsulfide, grain size, and total and dissolved organic \ncarbon (ASTM, 1990a). Bulk and interstitial \nconcentrations of chemicals of interest can be \ndetermined in subsamples of the sediment added \nto the toxicity test chambers to enhance the \ninterpretation of toxicity results. However, meth- \nods for sampling interstitial water have not been \nstandardized (ASTM, 199Ob). Sediment variables \nsuch as pH and Eh should also be monitored. \n3.2.1.2.2 Methods \nThe American Society for Testing and Materi- \nals (ASTM) has developed standard guidelines for \nseveral BSTTs (ASTM, 1990a, 1991). The most \ncommonly used of these partial life cycle tests \nfeature the marine amphipods Rhepoxynius abroni- \nus, Eohaustorius estuarius, Ampelisca abdita, and \nGrandidierella japonica (ASTM, 1990a); the \nfreshwater/estuarine amphipod Hyalella azteca \n(ASTM, 1990c); and the freshwater chironomid \nspecies Chironomus tentans and C. riparius \n(ASTM, 1990c). Brief generalized descriptions of \nthese tests are given below. \nBSTTs with the two freshwater chironomid \nspecies are functionally very similar, differing \nonly in the age of the organisms with which the \ntest is initiated and the duration of the test. Both \nC. tentans and C. riparius are available from \nvarious aquatic toxicology laboratories and com- \nmercial sources, and both species are cultured \neasily in a laboratory setting. Toxicity tests are \ninitiated by adding C. riparius <3 days old or C. \ntentans 10-14 days old (second instar) to test \nchambers that contain bulk sediment with over- \nlying water in various ratios (e.g., 6 water:1 \n3-2 \n3-BS\u2019ITApptoach \nsediment; Giesy et al., 1988). The length of the \ntest also varies with the biologica endpoint of \ninterest and the species used. If the biological \nendpoint of interest is growth and survival of the \nlarvae, the test is terminated after lo-14 days by \nsieving the C. riparks or C. tentans from the \nsediment. It also is possible to conduct the test \nuntil the adults emerge, which will occur (depend- \ning on temperature) in approximately 30 days for \nC. riparks and 20-25 days for C. r~larts. Toxi- \ncity test procedures with C. riprius and C. \ntentans are given in more detail in Adams .et al. \n(1985), Nebeker et al. (1984), Giesy et al. (1988), \nIngersoll and Nelson (1989), and ASTM (1991). \nPartial life-cycle toxicity tests with the fresh- \nwater/estuarine amphipod H. uzteca and bulk \nsediments have been conducted in a number of \nlaboratories. H. azteca are available from various \naquatic toxicology laboratories and commercial \nsources and can be cultured easily in a laboratory. \nToxicity tests are initiated by adding juveniles ~7 \ndays old to test chambers that contain bulk sedi- \nment with overlying water in various ratios (e.g., \n4 water:1 sediment; Ingersoll and Nelson, 1989). \n\u2018Ihe length of the test can range from ~10 days \n(short-term partial life-cycle test) to 30 days (long- \nterm partial life-cycle test) (Nebeker et a!,, 1984; \nIngersoll and Nelson, 1989). Depending on the \nIength of the test, biological endpoints include \nsurvival, behavior, growth, and reproduction. \nMore detailed descriptions of toxicity test proce- \ndures are given by Nebeker et al. (1984), Nebeker \nand Miller (1988), Ingersoll and Nelson (1989), \nand ASTM (1991). \nPartial life-cycle toxicity tests with the marine \namphipods Rhepoxynius abroniw, Eohaustorius \nestuarius, Ampelisca abdita, and Grandidierella \njaponica and bulk sediments have been used for \nsome time (Swartz et al., 1985a). Amphipods and \nbulk sediments generally are collected from the \nfield and acclimated to laboratory conditions for \n2-24 days before toxicity testing. The tests are \ninitiated by adding immature or adult amphipods \nto test chambers that contain bulk sediment with \noverlying water in various ratios. The length of \nthe test generally is ~10 days, and the biological \nresponses monitored consist of behavioral effects \n(e.g., emergence from the sediment, ability to burrow in clean sediment after exposure to test \nsediment) and mortality. More detailed descrig \nt@ns of the toxicity test procedures are given by \nSwartz et al. (1985a), Dewitt et al. (1989), Nipper \net al. (1989), Scott and Redmond (1989), ASTM \n(199Oa), and the Puget Sound Estuary Program \n(1991). Chronic test procedures for marine and \nestuarine amphipods are under development at \nseveral laboratories. Other test procedures for \nmarine and estuarine polychaetes, pelecypods, \nshrimp, and fish are described in the USEPA/ \nUSAGE (1991) and Reish and I&&y (1988) \nmanuals for testing dredged materials before \ndisposal. \n3.2.1.2.3 Types of Data Required \nThe physical and chemical data described \nabove under Section 3.2.1.2.1, Type of Sampling \nRequired, are needed to interpret the test results. \nThe required biological data (which vary by test) \nmay include mortality and various sublethal \neffects (e.g., changes in growth, reproduction, \nrespiration rate, behavior, or development). These \ndata can be compared to control and reference \ndata to determine the occurrence of biological \neffeds (ASTM, 199fla). Dilution experiments in \nwhich uncontaminated sediment is added to test \nsediment collected from the field can be used to \ncalculate L&, values, EC, values, aocffcd \nconcentrations, and lowest-observableeffect \nconcentrations (Swark et al., 1989). \n3.2.1.2.4 Necessary Hardware and Skills \nIn general, only re.adiIy available and inexpen- \nsive field \u2018and laboratory equipment is needed, \nprocedures are fairly simple and straightforward, \nand a minimum of training is necessary to detect \nendpoints through toxicity tests. Interpretation of \nthe toxicity data (chemical and biological) requires \na higher degree of skill and training. Chemical \nsampling methods are generally simple and rou- \nhe, although analysis of chemical samples re- \nquires specialized training and equipment. Some \nbiological effects tests also require specialized \ntraining, handling, and facilities. \n3-3 \nSediment Classifkdon Methods Compendium \n3.2.1.3 Adequacy of Documentation \nVarious sediment toxicity test procedures have \nbeen developed and well documented for testing \nfield sediments (A!XM 1990a; Chapman 1986a, \n1988; Lamberson and Swartz, 1988; Melzian, \n1990; Puget Sound Estuary Program (PSEP) 1991; \nSwartz, 1987; Thompson et al., 1989; USEPff \nUSACE, 1991). Although standardization of \nmethodology is progressing, intercalibration \namong laboratories and better field validation are \nneeded. \n3.2.2 Applicability of Method to Human \nHealth, Aquatic Life, or Wildlife \nProtection \nThe BSlT approach is suitable only for \nprotection of aquatic life. Sediment toxicity test \nprocedures incorporate a direct measure of sedi- \nment biological effects and can be used to predict \nbiological effects of contaminated sediments \nbefore approval of state and federal disposal \npermits. These procedures can be used to assess \nthe Qxicity of sediments in the natural environ- \nment and to predict the effects of these sediments \non resident aquatic life. Combined with other \napproaches such as the AET and the Triad \napproaches (Chapman, 1986b), BSTTs can be \nused to establish sediment quality criteria. Use of \nthe most sensitive species within a benthic com- \nmunity as a test organism will serve to protect the \nstructure and function of the entire ecosystem \n(Becker et al., 1990). \n3.23 Ability of Method to Genente \nNumerical Criteria for Specific \nChemicals \nThe BAIT approach cannot be used by itself \nto generate sediment quality criteria. Instead it \nmust be combined with chemical measurements \nand other data to generate information on the \neffects of individual contaminants. Both the Triad \nand the AET approaches rely on bulk sediment toxicity data to derive numerical criteria. ms \nin conjunction with sediment quality criteria \nderived from equilibrium partitioning (USEPA, \n1980; Swartz et al., 1990) can also be used in \nassessments of potentially contaminated sediments \n(= Chapter 6, Equilibrium Partitioning \nApproach). \n33 USEFULNESS \n33.1 Environmental AppliabRkty \n3.3.1.1 Suitability for DiDrent Sediment l)pes \nThe sediment toxicity test approach is suitable \nfor any type of sediment. In some cases, the \nphysical or chemical properties of the test sedi- \nmen4 such as salinity or grain size, may limit the \nselection of organisms that can be used for testing \n(Ott, 1986; Dewitt et al., 1989). Appropriate \ncontrols or statistical models (Dewitt et al., 1988) \nfor sediment properties may be necessary to \ndiscriminate chemical toxicity from conventional \neffects. In establishing sediment quality criteria, \nthe effects of features of the sediment itself, such \nas grain size, must be recognized (Dewitt et al., \n1988). Data can be normalized to such factors as \norganic carbon or acid volatile sulfide (DiToro et \nal., 1990, 1991; Nebeker et al., 1989) and thus \ncan be applied to any sediment. However, nor- \nmalization techniques are in the developmental \nstage (see Chapter 6, Equilibrium Partitioning \nApproach). \n3.3.1.2 Suitability for Different Chemicals or \nClasses of Chemicals \nBSTI\u2019 is the only currently available approach \nthat directly measures the biological effects of all \nclasses of chemicals, including the combined \n.interactive (additive, synergistic, antagonistic) \ntoxic effects among individual chemicals in \nmixtures of contaminants usually found in field \nsediments (Plesha et al., 1988; SW& et al., \n1989). Bioaccumulative chemicals can be eval- \nuated if the length of the test is extended to ensure \nadequate exposure of the test organism. \n34 \n3-\u201cSTT Appruach \n3.3.1.3 Suitability for Predicting Eficts on \nDiflerent Organisms \nTheoretically, any organism can be used in \nsediment toxicity testing. To protect a biological \ncommunity and to predict the effects of contami- \nnated sediments on different organisms, test \norganisms should be selected on the basis of their \nsensitivity to contaminants, their ability to with- \nstand laboratory handling, and their ability to \nsurvive in control and reference treatments \n(Dewitt et al., 1989, Reish and LeMay, 1988; \nShuba et al., 1981). In tests to determine the \neffects of contaminated sediments on a particular \nbiological community, the test species selected \nshould be among the most sensitive found in the \ncommunity of interest, or should be comparably \nsensitive. Test species should include more than \none type of organism to ensure a range of sensi- \ntivity to various types of contaminants (Becker et \nal., 1990). \n3.3.1.4 Suitability for In-Place Pollutant Control \nSediment toxicity testing can be used directly \nto monitor in-place pollution. As discussed in \nSection 3.2.1.1, sediment toxicity testing can be \nused to determine the extent of the problem area, \nmonitor temporal and spatial trends, detect the \npresence of unsuspected hot spots, assess the need \nfor remedial actions, and monitor changes in \ntoxicity after remediation. Such tests can also be \nused as a cost-effective and rapid screening tool \nfor in situ pollutant reconnaissance surveys and in \na priori simulations of proposed remedial actions \nto test the effectiveness of capping or other reme- \ndial alternatives. \n3.3.1.5 Suitability for Source Control \nBulk field sediment toxicity testing can be \nused .to identify suspected sources of sediment \npollution. Field reconnaissance surveys can reveal \nhot spots near contaminant sources, and a map \nshowing contours of sediment toxicity values can \nreveal gradients that identify point and aonpoint \nsources (Swartz et al., 1982). Toxicity testing \ncannot be used by itself to verify reductions in the mass loading of chemicals that might be expected \nas a result of source control. However, the bio- \nlogical effects of source control can be represented \nthrough the use of BSTT. \n33.1.6 Sui&bility for Disposd Applicatims \nBSlT has been used widely in regulatory \nprograms to determine the toxicity of material \nbefore disposal (Reish and LeMay, 1988; USEPA/ \nUSACE, 1991). The potential hazard to benthic \norganisms at the disposal site (which is deter- \nmined by making comparisons with the \u201crefer- \nence\u201d sediments collected near the disposal site) \ncan be predicted from laboratory toxicity test \nresults. Sediment toxicity tests also can be used \nto monitor conditions at the disposal site both \nbefore and after a disposal operation. \n3.33 General Advantages and Llmltatlons \n33.2.1 Ease of Use \nMost sediment toxicity test procedures are \nsimple to use, requiring limited expertise and \nstandard inexpensive laboratory equipment (PSEP, \n1991). Only a few sublethal effects tests require \nspecialized training. Field sampling requires only \nreadily available equipment and standard \nprocedures (ASTM, 199Ob). \n3.3.2.2 Relative Cost \nIndividual laboratory toxicity tests and field \nsampling are cost-effective because they require \nlimited expertise and inexpensive equipment. \nSuch costs generally range from $150 to $500 per \nsampling replicate. Laboratory sediment toxicity \ntesting is a comparatively inexpensive and cost- \neffective method of monitoring the field distri- \nbution of sediment toxicity because it integrates \nthe effects of all toxic contaminants, does not \nrequire individual chemical measurements, and \ndoes not require time-consuming analysis of \nbenthic community structure. \n3-5 \nSediment Cksificaficm Methods Compendium \n3.3.2.3 Tendency to Be Conservative \nSediment toxicity tests can be made as sensi- \ntive or as conservative (i.e., environmentally \nprotedive) as necessary through selection of \nbiological endpoints and species of test organism. \nReliance on mortality as an endpoint may be \nunderprotective, while some sublethal endpoints \n(e.g., enzyme inhibition) may be overprotective. \n3.3.2.4 Level ofAcceptance \nB!STI\u2019 is widely accepted by the scientific and \nregulatory communities and has been tested and \ncontested in court. Field sediment toxicity test \nresults have been published widely in peer- \nreviewed journals and incorporated into other \nmeasures of sediment quality such as the AET \nand the Triad approaches. Standard guides for \nsediment toxicity testing continue to be developed \nby ASI\u2019M (199Oa, 199Ob, 1991), and field sedi- \nment toxicity testing is incorporated into most \ndredged material disposal regulatory programs \n(PSEP, 1991; Reish and LeMay, 1988; USEPA/ \nUSAGE, 1991). Toxicity testing in general has \nlong been the basis for water quality criteria, \ndredged material testing, effluent testing, and \ndischarge monitoring. \n3.3.2.5 Ability to Be Implemented by \nLaboratories with 7)pical Equipment \nand Handling Facilities \nSediment toxicity test methods are easily \nimplemented by laboratories with typical equip- \nment using inexpensive glassware and procedures \nrequiring little specialized training, although the \ninterpretation of some sublethal biological end- \npoints may require some degree of training and \nexperience. Field sediment sample collection \nprocedures are routine. \n3.3.2.6 Level of Effort Required to Generate \nResults \nThis procedure consists of field sampling and \na laboratory toxicity test. Compared to an exten- \nsive survey of chemical concentrations or benthic community structure analysis, the level of effort is \nrelatively small. \n3.3.2.7 Degree to Which Results Lend \nThemselves to Interpretation \nBiological responses to toxic sediment can be \neasily interpreted. Generally, data fit \u201cpass-fail\u201d \ncriteria (i.e., the result is either above or below a \npredetermined acceptance level) or the result is \ncompared statistically to control and reference \nresults to determine whether there is a toxic effect. \nXiltle expert guidance is required for interpretation \nof mortality data although chronic or sublethal \neffects might require some explanation. \n3.3.2.8 Degree of Environmental Applicability \nAs noted in Section 3.3.1.1, the sediment \ntoxicity test approach applies to a wide range of \nenvironmental conditions and sediment types. The \neffects of various sediment properties such as \ngrain size and organic content can be addressed \nexperimentally with appropriate uncontaminated \ncontrols. \n3.3.2.9 Degree of Accuracy and Prekion \nBecause the sediment toxicity test is a labora- \ntory-controlled experiment, its results have a high \ndegree of accuracy, precision, and repeatability. \n3.4 STATUS \n3.4.1 Extent of Use \nSediment toxicity tests are widely used in \nresearch and regulatory programs in both marine \nand freshwater systems (ASTM, 199Oa, 1991), as \ndescribed in Section 3.2.1.1. Sediment toxicity \ntests also are incorporated into the evaluation of \napplications for dredged material disposal permits \nand are used to assess the toxicity of sediments \nsubject to regulatory decisions. BSITs are used \nto investigate the mechanisms of sediment toxicity \nto benthic organisms (Kemp and Swartx, 1989; \nSwartz et ul., 1988). \n34 3-BS\u2019ITAppmch \n3.4.2 Extent to Which Approach I-hs Been \nField-Validated \nField validation of BSIT includes several \npublications in peer-reviewed literature (Chapman, \n1986b; Plesha et al., 1988; Swartz et al., 1982, \n1986, 1989). As more data become available, \nresults can be compared with available informa- \ntion on contaminant concentrations in sediment in \nareas where biological effects have been observed. \nThe effects of interactions among contaminants, as \nwell as the effects of nonchemical sediment \nvariables, must be taken into consideration when \nattempts are made at field validation (Dewitt et \nal., 1988; Swartz et al., 1989). h noted in \nSection 3.2.1.3, better field validation of predicted \neffects is needed. \n3.43 Reasons for Limlted Use \nBS\u2019IT has been widely used in research and \nregulatory programs (see Section 3.4.1, Extent of \nUse). \n3.4.4 Outlook for Future Use and Amount of \nDevelopment Yet Needed \nThe outlook for future use of sediment toxi- \ncity tests is promising where direct measurement \nof biological effects of toxicants in sediments is \ndesired especially where the effects of chemical \ninteractions are of interest. Development and \nstandardization of biological testing methods \nshould continue, especiaIly for tests using species \nlocally available in geographic areas that have not \nbeen represented such as tropical and arctic re- \ngions. More emphasis should be placed on the \ndevelopment of procedures to measure chronic \neffects. Methods should be compared and stand- \nardized among laboratories, and results should be \nfield-validated to establish their ability to predict \nbiological effects on populations and communities \nin the field. As more toxicity tests are conducted \nand the results subject to a quality assurance \nreview, results should be compiled in a central \ndatabase so that comparisons can be made among \nspecies, methods, and laboratories. 3.5 REFERENCES \nAdams, W.J., R.A.

Swartz \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Pacific Ecosystems Branch, ERL-N \n2111 Southeast Marine Science Dr., Newport, OR 97365-5260 \n(503) 867-4031 \nThe toxicological approach to generating sedi- \nment quality criteria uses concentration-response \ndata from sediments spiked in the laboratory with \nknown concentrations of contaminants. Sediments \nare spiked to establish cause-and effect relation- \nships between chemicals and adverse biological \nresponses (e.g., mortality, reduction in growth or \nreproduction, physiological changes). Individual \nchemicals or other potentially toxic substances can \nbe tested alone or in combination to determine \ntoxic concentrations of contaminants in sediment. \nThis approach can be used to generate sediment \nquality criteria or to validate sediment quality \ncriteria generated by other approaches. \n4.1 SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS \n4.1.1 Current Use \nThe spiked-sediment toxicity test (SSTT) \napproach is in the research stage. Although the \nprocedures used resemble those used to generate \nwater quality criteria, the influence of the variable \nproperties of sediment makes generating quality \ncriteria values much more complex. \nWhere LC50 values and chronic effects data \nare available for chemicals in sediments (see \nSection 4.3.2.3), they can be used to identify \nconcentrations of chemicals in sediment that are \nprotective of aquatic life. The predictive value of \nsediment quality criteria generated by this \napproach should be tested by comparing them \nwith field data on chemical concentrations in \nnatural sediments and observed biological effects. \nHowever, interim laboratory-derived criteria can \nbe implemented before field validation. 4.1.2 Potential use \nThis method can be used to address empirical- \nly the problem of interactions among complex \nmixtures of contaminants that are almost always \npresent in the field (Swartz et al., 1988, 1989). \nChemical-specific data can be generated for a \nwide variety of classes of chemical contaminants, \nincluding metals, PAHs, PCBs, dioxins, and \nchlorinated pesticides. Both acute and chronic \ncriteria can be established, and the approach is \napplicable to both marine and freshwater systems \n(Tetra Tech, 1986; Battelle, 1988). However, \nunless the sediment factor that normalizes for \nbioavailability is known, this procedure must be \napplied to every sediment (i.e., a value derived for \none sediment may not be applied with predictable \nresults to another sediment with different \nproperties). \n4.2 DESCRIPTION \n4.2.1 Description of Method \nThe toxicological approach involves expos- \ning test organisms to sediments that have been \nspiked with known quantities of potentially toxic \nchemicals or mixtures of compounds. At the \nend of a specified time period, the response of \nthe test organism is examined in relation to a \nbiological endpoint (e.g., mortality, growth, \nreproduction, cytotoxicity, alterations in devel- \nopment or respiration rate). Results are then \nstatistically compared with results from control \nor reference sediments to identify toxic concen- \ntrations of the test chemical. \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \n4.2.1.1 Objectives and Assumptions \nThe objective of this approach is to derive in \nthe laboratory concentration-response values that \ncan be used to predict the concentrations of \nspecific chemicals harmful to resident biota under \nfield conditions. The effects of the inter- \nactions--synergism, additivity, antagonism- \namong chemicals in the field can be predicted \nfrom laboratory results with sediments spiked with \ncombinations of chemicals. This method can be \nused for all classes of sediments and any chemical \ncontaminant. The bioavailable component of \ncontaminants in sediment can be determined by \nthis method, and an a priori knowledge of specif- \nic pathways of interaction between sediments and \ntest organisms is not necessary. Any method of \nexpressing the bioavailability of contaminants in \nsediment can be used with sediment toxicity tests, \nincluding the \u201cfree\u201d interstitial concentration and \nnormalization to organic carbon, acid volatile \nsulfide, and other sediment properties. \nData generated by this method may be diffi- \ncult to interpret if the normalizing factor for \nbioavailability is unknown. If the normalization \nfactor is known, this method can be used to \nvalidate sediment quality criteria generated by \nother approaches. It is assumed that laboratory \nresults for a given sediment and overlying water \nrepresent biological effects of similar sediments in \nthe field, and that the behavior of chemicals in \nspiked sediments is similar to that in natural, in \nsitu sediments. \n4.2.1.2 Level of Effort \nImplementation of this procedure requires a \nmoderate to considerable amount of laboratory \neffort. The various toxicity test procedures that \nhave been developed are generally straightfor- \nward and well documented (Lamberson and \nSwartz, 1988; Melzian, 1990; Nebeker et al., \n1984; Swartz et al., 1989; PSEP, 1991). How- \never, many individual tests would be required to \ngenerate an extensive database of sediment quality \nvalues for a large number of chemicals, chemical \ncombinations, and sediment types. 4.2.1.2.1 Type of Sampling Required \nCollection of sediments from the field is \nrequired. Depending on the particular study \nobjectives, the sediments may be clean (uncontam- \ninated) sediments from a control area, uncontami- \nnated reference sediments for comparison with \nsimilarly contaminated sediments, or contaminated \nsediments to be spiked with known concentrations \nof chemicals in a test for interactions among \ncontaminants. Sufficient sediment must be col- \nlected to provide samples for chemical analysis, \nspiking, and reference or controls (i.e., sediment \nfor statistical comparison with spiked sediment). \nDepending on the experimental design, the follow- \ning controls might be required: sediment from the \ncollection site for test animals (or culture sediment \nfor laboratory-cultured animals), positive controls \nwith a reference toxicant, carrier controls, and \nreference sediment controls for natural sediment \nfeatures that may affect test animals, such as grain \nsize distribution (Dewitt et al., 1988). \n4.2.1.2.2 Methods \nVarious methods of adding chemicals to \nsediment (spiking sediments) have been used. In \ngeneral, the chemical is either added to the sedi- \nment and mixed in (Birge et al., 1987; Ditsworth \net al., 1990; Francis et al., 1984) or added to the \noverlying water (Hansen and Tagatz, 1980; Kemp \nand Swartz, 1988) or to a sediment slurry (Lan- \ndrum, 1989; Oliver, 1984; Schuytema et al., 1984) \nand allowed to equilibrate with the sediment. \nSediments are spiked with a range of concentra- \ntions to generate LC50 data or to determine a \nminimum concentration at which biological effects \nare observed. \nThe effect of sediment contaminants on \nbenthic biota is determined either by exposing \nknown numbers of individual benthic test organ- \nisms to the sediment for a specific length of time \n(Swartz et al., 1985) or by exposing larvae of \nbenthic species to the sediment in flowing natural \nwaters (Hansen and Tagatz, 1980). Biological \nresponses are determined at the end of the test \nperiod using response criteria that include mortali- \nty, changes in growth or reproduction, behavioral \n4-2 \n4-SSl-T Apptoach \nor physiological alterations, or differences in \nnumbers and species of larvae in contaminated \nversus control sediments. \n4.2.1.2.3 Types of Data Required \nSpiked sediments, as well as reference or \ncontrol sediments, must be analyzed for total \nsolids, grain size, and total and dissolved organ- \nic carbon. The concentralions of toxicants \nadded to sediment must be determined \u2018in stock \nsolutions as well as in the test sediment. Bulk \nand interstitial levels of the spiked chemicals in \nthe test sediment must be determined throughout \na concentration range at least at the beginning \nand at tbe end of the toxicity test. However, \nmethods for sampling interstitial water have not \nbeen standardized. If sediment properties lbat \ncontrol availability, such as acid volatile sulfides \nor dissolved or total organic carbon, change \nduring exposure, measurements must be taken \nbefore, during and at the end of the exposure \nperiod. In addition, these changes must be taken \ninto account in interpreting the data. Sediment \nparameters such as pH and Eh should also be \nmonitored. \nBiological and chemical data are compared \nstatistically with control or reference data to \ndetermine the occurrence of biological effects, \nand can be used to calculate LC, values, EC, \nvalues, no-effect concentrations, or lowest- \nobservable-effect concentrations. Establishment \nof the maximum acceptable toxicanl concentra- \ntion requires data from a chronic or life-cycle \ntest. \nData correlating observed biological effects \nwith chemical concentrations in spiked sediment \ncan be used to calculate probit curves for deriva- \ntion of biological effect level values (e.g., EC,). \nData from several species of lest organisms can \nbe ranked, and the lowest contaminant concen- \ntrations that affect the most sensitive species can \nbe used to establish sediment quality criteria that \nwill protect tbe entire benthic community and \nassociated aquatic ecosystem. This approach has \nregulatory and scientific precedence in the \ndevelopment of water quality criteria. 4.2.1.2.4 Necessary Hardware and Skills \nMost toxicity test procedures require a mini- \nmum of specialized hardware and level of skill. \nIn general, only readily available and inexpensive \nlaboratory equipment is needed, procedures are \nfairly simple and straightforward, and a minimum \nof training is necessary to detect and interpret \nbiological endpoints. Although analysis of chemi- \ncal samples requires specialized training and \nequipment, the chemical sampling methods for \nspiked-sediment toxicity are generally simple and \nroutine. Some biological effects tests also require \nspecialized training and experience, especially to \ninterpret the results. \n4.2.1.3 Adequacy of Documentation \nVarious acute sediment toxicity test proce- \ndures have been developed and are well docu- \nmented for testing freshwater and marine field \nsediments (Chapman, 1986,1988; Lamberson and \nSwartz, 1988; Melzian, 198% Swartz, 1987). \nAlthough only a few of these procedures have \nbeen used witb laboratory-spiked sediments, most \nof the established methods could be used with \nlaboratory-prepared sediments as well as with field \nsediments. \nIn contrast to acute tests, there are relatively \nfew procedures for testing the chronic effects of \ncontaminated sediments on benthic invertebrates. \nLife-cycle test methodology has been presented \nfor the amphipods Ampelisca abdita (Scott and \nRedmond, 1989), HyaleZIa azteca (ASTM, 199oc, \nBorgmann and Munawar, 1989), and Grand- \nidierella lutosa and G. lignorum (Connell and \nAirey, 1982); the polychaetes Neanthes arenaceo- \n&ntata (Pesch, 1979) and Capitellu capitata \n(Chapman .and Fink, 1984); freshwater oligo- \nchaetes (Wiederholm el al., 1987); and species of \nDaphnia and Chironomus (ASTM, 1991; Nebeker \net al., 1988). Chronic exposures to most sensitive \nlife stages are also inherent in the benthic recol- \nonization procedure (Hansen and Tagatz, 1980). \nFurther research is needed to develop and validate \nmethodology for other species. \n4-3 \nSediment Class+cat~ Methods Compendium \n4.2.2 AppUabUty ot Method to Humw~ \nHealth, Aquatic Ufe, or Wildlife \nProtectkul \nSpiked-sediment toxicity tests incorporate a \ndirect measure of sediment biological effects. This \napproach is the only method that can quantify the \ninteractive effects of combinations of contaminants \ndiEtly. \nWhen chemical concentrations in tested biota \nare measured after a spikedsediment toxicity test, \nuptake of contaminants by benthic organisms (bio- \naccumulation) can be predicted. As an important \ncomponent of food webs in aquatic ecosystems, \nbenthic organisms can contriiute toxicants accumu- \nlated from contaminated sediments to higher levels \nof the aquatic food web and ultimately affect human \nhealth. Sediment quality criteria and bioauxrmula- \ntion studies using sediment toxicity test methods can \nhelp to set limits on the disposal of toxic sediments \nand predict uptake of toxicants into food webs. If \nthis approach is combined with chemical analysis of \nsediment samples and BSTT, these limits can be \nused to defme areas from which food species should \nnot be harvested or consumed or where direct \ncontact with contaminated sediments can be hazard- \nous to human health. \nBioaccumulation studies and sediment quality \nuiteria estabkhed using data from SSTT with \nseveral benthic species can also be used to protect \nbenthic communities and aquatic species that feed \non the benthos. Assuming that a sufficient mix of \ntaxonomic groups is used, a sediment quality aiteri- \non based on the responses of the most sensitive \nspecies within a benthic community can be devel- \noped. This criterion can then be employed to \nprotect the stnrcture and function of the entire \necosystem (Hansen and Tagatz, 1980). \n4.23 Ability of Method to Generate NumericA \nCriteria for Specific Chemkals \nLaboratory tests with the SSlT approach can be \nused to measure the effects of specific chemicals in \nvarious types of sediments directly and to establish \nunequivocal analysis of causal effeds. Test condi- \ntions allow this method to determine the effects of \nindividual chemicals or mixtures of chemicals on \n44 benthic biota (Plesha et al., 1988; SwarQ cl d., \n1988, 1989), establish pathways of toxicity, and \nprovide specific effects concentrations (e.g. & \nEC, noeffect concentration). The influence of \nvarious physical &.rac&ristics of the sediment on \ncimnkal toxicity also can be determined (Dewitt er \nal., 1988, Ott 1986). \u2018Ibe available data reprezznt \nconcentrations at which toxicity occurs rather than \nnumerical sediment quality criteria. Recent spiked \nsediment studies have provided data that can be \nuseful in setting preliminary sediment criteria levels \nbased on quiliirium partitioning models and water \nquality values (Swartz et al., 1990). \nConcentration-response data have been gener- \nated using SSIT for a variety of chemicals, includ- \ning metals and organic compounds. Specific data \nare available for phenanthrene, fluoranthene, tic., \nmercury, copper, cadmium, hexachlorobenzene, \npentachlorophenol, Aroclor 1242 and X54, chlor- \ndane, DDE, DDT, die&in, endosulfan, e&in, \nsevin, ueusote, and kepone (Adams et al., 1985; \nCairns et al., 1984, Dewitt et al., 1989; Kemp and \nSwarlz, 1989; McLeese and MetcaRe, 1980; Mc- \nIxese ei al., 1982; Nebeker et al., 198% Swartz et \nal., 1986, 1988, 1989; Tagatz et al., 1977, 1979, \n1983, Word et ol., 1987). Concentrations of non- \nionic organic compounds are usually normalized to \nsediment organic carbon or acid volatile sullide \n(D~Toro et al., 1990, 1991; Nebeker et al., 1989). \nNormalizing factors for other compounds in \nsediment currently are being researched. \n43 usEFl?LNEss \n43.1 Eovbwmental Appltcrbility \n4.3.1.1 Suitabihiy fbr Difirent Seahent Types \nThe SSlT approach is suitable for any type of \nsediment. This appioach also can be used to \nestablish the bioavailable component of the sedi- \nment responsible for the observed toxicity. The \neffects of various physical properties of the sedi- \nment on chemical toxicity can be determined \nexperimentally. In some cases, the physical or \nchemical properties of the test sediment such as \nsalinity or grain size may limit the species of \norganisms that can be used for testing, and a \nsubstitute species must be used (Dewitt et al., \n1988, 1989). When establishing sediment quality \ncriteria, the effects of adverse physical or chemical \nproperties of the sediment itself must be reflected. \nWhen factors controlling bioavailability (e.g., \norganic carbon, acid volatile sulfide) are known, \ndata can be normalized to such factors, and the \napproach applied to any sediment type. \n4.3.1.2 Suitability for Different Chemicals or \nClasses of Chemicals \nA major advantage of the SSTI\u2019 method is \nthat it is suitable for all classes of chemicals. In \naddition, it is the only approach currently avail- \nable that can empirically determine the interactive \neffects among individual chemicals in mixtures of \ncontaminants usually found in real-world sedi- \nments (Swartz ef al., 1988, 1989). This approach \nalso can be used to provide experimental valida- \ntion of sediment quality criteria generated by other \napproaches. \n4.3.1.3 Suitability for Predicting E,@xts on \nDifferent Organisms \nTheoretically, any organism can be used in \nSSTT. To protect a biological community and to \npredict the effects of a toxicant on different organ- \nisms, test organisms should be selected based on the \nfollowing criteria: (1) their sensitivity to contami- \nnants, (2) their ability to withstand laboratory \nhandling, and (3) their ability to survive in control \ntreatments. Tests to determine the effeds of \ntoxicants on a particular biological community \nshould use the most sensitive species found in the \ncommunity or a species with comparable sensitivity. \n4.3.1.4 Suhbifity for In-Place Pollutant Control \nSSIT can be used to develop sediment quality \ncriteria, which will then be used to determine the \nextent of the problem area. It also can be used to \nmonitor temporal and spatial trends and to assess the \nneed for remedial action. Criteria can be used in \nsetting target cleanup levels and in post-cleanup \nmonitoring of actual contaminant levels. 4.3.2.5 S~iliiy for Source Ctmbvl \n!SlT can be combined with wasteload aUoca- \ntion models and used in source control to establish \nmaximum allowable effluent concentrations or mass \nloadings of single chemicals and mixtums of drank \ncals. \n4.3.1.6 Suitabildy for Dis- Apphztians \nSSTT can be used to predid the biological \neffects of aMaminants before approval of dredged \nmaterial disposal or sewage outfall permits. \n43.2 Genend Advantages md Unltatk~ns \n4.3.2.1 Ease of Use \nMost sediment toxicity test procedures arc \nsimple to use, require limited expertise, and use \nstandard laboratory equipment. Some of the sub- \nlethal-effects tests require specialized training. \n4.3.2.2 Relative Cost \nThe cost of individual toxicity tests is relativeIy \nlow because such tests require limited expertise and \ninexpensive equipment. (See Chapter 3, Bulk Se& \nment Toxicity Approach.) \u2018Ibe costs to implemtnt \nthis approach as a regulatory tool would be ccmqu- \natively high because SSIT requires the cokction of \nsediment chemistry data for comparison to data \nestabliied by the sediient toxicity test method \n\u2018he cost of developing a large toxic&gical data- \nbase would be relatively high because of the large \nnumber of individual chemicaIs and sediments that \nwould have to be tested. Generating the citemicaI \nand toxicologicaI data necessary to establish I \nsediment quality criterion for one chemical by this \nmethod is estimated to cost $100,000. \n4.3.23 Tendency b Be Conservutiw \nL&oratorycontrolled SSIT experiments pm- \nvide a high degree of accuracy. The tests are \ncontrolled sufficiently to give an estimate of the \ntoxicity of individual chemicals in sediment. I.& \noratory bioassays, especially acute toxicity tests, are \n4-s \nSe&nent Classification Methods Compmdium \ninherently limited in their ability to reflect ail of the \necological processes through which sediment con- \ntaminants may affect benthic ecosystems in the field. \n4.3.2.4 Level of Acceptance \nSSTT methods, which follow the procedures \nand rationale used to develop water quality cri- \nteria, are easily interpreted, technically acceptable, \nand legally defensible. The procedures and \nresulting data have been accepted and published in \npeer-reviewed journal articles, and some proce- \ndures have been incorporated into standard guide- \nlines by ASTM\u2019s subcommittee on sediment \ntoxicology (ASTM, 19!3Oa, 199Oc). \n4.3.2.5 Abiliry to Be implemented by \nLaboratories with Qpical Equipment \nand Handling Facilities \nSSIT methods are implemented easily by \nlaboratories with typical equipment, requiring \ninexpensive glassware and little specialized train- \ning. Spiking sediments may require special \nhandling facilities for preparing stock solutions of \nhikhiy toxic substances, and the interpretation of \nsome sublethal biological endpoints may require \nsome degree of training and experience. \n4.3.2.6 Level of Eflort Required to Generate \nResults \nThis procedure consists of a laboratory toxi- \ncity test and requires a moderate amount of effort \nto begin and end an experiment. The data gener- \nated must be compiled, and some calculations \nmust be made to derive concentration-response \nrelationships. The generation of chemical and \nbiological data required for a large database of \nsediment quality values based on this approach \nwould require a relatively high level of effort. \n4.3.2.7 Degree to Which Results Lend \nThemselves lo Interpretation \nSediment toxicity tests applied to spiked sedi- \nments provide an unequivocal analysis of cause- \nand-effect relationships between toxic chemicals \n4-4 and biological responses. Because the procedures \nfollow the rationale used in the development of \nwater quality criteria, the methods are legally \ndefensible. Toxicity tests bave long been accepted \nby both the public and the scientific community as \na basis for water quality criteria and dredged \nmaterial testing. \n4.3.2.8 Degree of Environmen la1 Applicability \nThe SSIT approach is applicable to a wide \nrange of environmen.tai conditions and sediment \ntypes. The confounding effects of sediment vari- \nables such as grain size and organic content can \nbe addressed experimentally by using toxicity test \nmethods or can be addressed by using normai- \nization equations (Dewitt et al. 1988). A major \nadvantage of SSTI\u2019 is the ability to predict inter- \nactive effects of chemical mixtures such as those \nfound in field sediments. \n4.3.2.9 Degree of Accuracy and Precision \nBecause the SSTT is a laboratory-controlled \nexperiment, results have a high degree of accuracy \nand precision. The procedure produces a direct \ndose-response data set for individual chemicals in \nsediment. Sediment criteria generated by this \napproach must be field-validated. \n4.4 STATUS \n4.4.1 Extent of Use \nSSIT procedures are under development in \nseveral laboratories. Spiking procedures, as well \nas biological test procedures, are currently being \nstandardized by ASTM\u2019s sediment toxicology \nsubuxnmittee (ASTM, E9Ob). \n4.4.2 Extent to Wbkb Approach Has Been \nField-Validated \nAlthough some results have been published, \nspiked-sediment toxicity test values have not been \nwell validated in the field, (Piesha et al., 1988; \nSwartz et al., 1989). As more data and criteria \n4-SSTT Approach \nvalues become available, they can be compared \nwith existing information on contaminant levels in \nsediment in areas where biological effects have \nbeen observed. The effects of interactions among \ncontaminants, as well as the effects of nonchemi- \ncal sediment variables, must be considered during \nfield validation (Dewitt et al., 1988; Swartz et al., \n1989). \n4.43 Reasons for Limited Use \nAlthough some data have been generated and \ncompared to field conditions, the approach is still \nin the developmental stage in several laboratories, \nand a relatively large expenditure of effort will be \nneeded to generate a large database. To date, \nthere have been few comparisons of methods and \nspecies sensitivity, and few chronic toxicity tests \nhave been developed. \n4.4.4 Outlook for Future Use and Amount of \nDevelopment Yet Needed \nThe outlook for future use of SSlTs or other \nsediment toxicity tests is promising where \naccurate, direct dose-response data are desired, or \nwhere the effects of chemical interactions need to \nbe examined. Development of sediment-spiking \nand biological-testing methods should continue, \nmethods should be compared and standardized \namong laboratories, and results should be fieid- \nvalidated to establish their ability to predict \nbiological effects in sediments. As more toxicity \ntests are conducted, results should be compiled \nin a central database so that comparisons can \nbe made among species, methods, and laboratories \nand so that sediment quality criteria can be \ndeveloped. \n4.5 REFERENCES \nAdams, W.J., R.A.

CHAPTER 5 \nInterstitial Water Toxicity Identification \nEvaluation Approach \nGerald Ankley and Nelson Thomas \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Research Laboratory \n6201 Congdon Boulevard, Duluth, MN 55804 \n(218) 720-5702 \nThe interstitial water toxicity approach is a \nmultiphase procedure for assessing sediment toxicity \nusing interstitial (pore) water. The use of pore \nwater for sediment toxicity assessment is based on \nthe strong correlations between contaminant concen- \ntrations in pore water and observed exposure of \nbenthic macroinvertebrates to sediment-associated \ncontaminants (Adams et al., 1985; Swartz el al., \n1985; 1988; 1990, Connell et al., 1988; Knezovich \nand Harrison, 1988; USEPA, 1989a; DiToro et al., \n1990), as well as correlations between the actual \ntoxicity of pore water and bulk sediments to epi- \nbenthic or benthic species (Ankley et al., 1991a). \nThe approach combines the quantification of pore \nwater toxicity with toxicity identification evaluation \n(TIE) procedures to identify and quantify chemical \ncomponents responsible for sediment toxicity (U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, 1988; 1989b; \n1989c, 1991a). TIE involves the use of toxicity- \nbased fractionation procedures to identify toxic \ncompounds in aqueous samples containing mixtures \nof chemicals (Burkhard and Ankley, 1989). In the \ninterstitial water toxicity method, TIE procedures are \nimplemented in three phases to characterize the \nnature of the pore water toxicant(s), identify the \nsuspect toxicant(s), and confirm identification of the \nsuspect toxicant(s). \n5.1 SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS \n5.1.1 Current Use \nThe TIE procedures described herein were \ndeveloped over the last 4 years using municipal and \nindustrial effluents from more than 50 locations, as \nwell as sediment samples from more than 10 differ- \nent sites. They have been used with several aquatic \nspecies including cladocerans, fishes, and epibenthic macroinvertebrates. Although the methods were \ndeveloped largely with freshwater species, they are \ngenerally applicable to, and are currently being used \nwith, marine organisms as well. The procedures \nhave proven to be successful in identifying acutely \ntoxic substances in more than 90 percent of the \nsamples to which they have been applied (e.g., \nAnkley et al., 1990a, 1991b; Kuehl et al., 1990; \nAmato et al, 1991; Norberg-King et al., 1991; \nSchubauer-Berigan and Ankley, 1991; Ankley and \nBurkhard., 1992). \n5.1.2 Potential uses \nThe use of pore water as a fraction to assess \nsediment toxicity, in conjunction with associated \nTIE procedures, can provide data concerning specif- \nic compounds responsible for toxicity of contaminat- \ned sediments. These data could be critical to the \nsuccess of remediation of toxic sediments, including \nthe control of inputs of contaminants. \nIn spite of existing uncertainties in preparing \nand using pore water to assess sediment toxicity, the \nability to identify specific toxicants responsible for \nacute toxicity in contaminated sediments makes pore \nwater an important test fraction. Thus this method, \nin conjunction with other sediment classification \nmethods, could prove to be extremely valuable. \n5.2 DESCRIPTION \n5.2.1 Description of Method \nThe interstitial water toxicity method involves \nthree major steps: \nl Isolation of pore water from sediment \nsamples; \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \n\u2022 Performance of toxicity tests on pore \nwaters; and \n\u2022 Application of TIE procedures to pore \nwater fractions. \nPore water can be isolated from sediment \nsamples by compression (squeezing) techniques, \ndisplacement of water from sediment via the use \nof inert gases, centrifugation, extraction via dialy- \nsis, and micro-syringe sampling (Knezovich et al., \n1987; Knezovich and Harrison, 1988; Sly, 1988; \nUSEPA, 1991b). The most representative pore \nwater samples may be obtained using the latter \ntwo procedures. However, the resulting sample \nvolumes are too small to be useful for toxicity \ntests and associated TIE work. Centrifugation has \nbeen used in a number of studies evaluating the \ntoxicity of sediment pore water (Giesy et al., \n1988; Swartz et al., 1989; Hoke et al., 1990; \nAnkley et al., 1990a; Schubauer-Berigan and \nAnkley, 1991) and comparative studies at Duluth, \nas well as other laboratories, indicate that centrifu- \ngation is a reasonable technique for pore water \npreparation (Schults et al., 1991; U.S. Environ- \nmental Protection Agency, 1991b). Regardless of \nthe techniques chosen for pore water isolation, the \nmethod should not involve filtration either during \nor after preparation (Schubauer-Berigan and \nAnkley, 1991; USEPA, 1991b). \nAfter preparation of pore water, toxicity tests \ncan be performed using either standard test species \n(e.g., USEPA, 1985a, 1985b) or various types of \nepibenthic or benthic organisms amenable to \ntoxicity testing in aqueous samples (Ankley et al., \n1991a; USEPA, 1991b). In samples exhibiting \nacute toxicity, it is then possible to directly apply \nthe TIE procedures described below in Section \n5.2.1.2.2. \n5.2.1. I Objectives and Assumptions \nThe objective of the interstitial water toxicity \nmethod is to derive chemical-specific toxicity data \nin the laboratory that can be used to assess sedi- \nment toxicity in field situations. With this ap- \nproach, it is possible to quantify toxicity in a \nsample and potentially to identify chemical com- portents responsible for toxicity. The major \nassumption in using this method is that the am- \npounds that are toxic to test organisms in the pore \nwater, as it is isolated in the laboratory, are the \nsame compounds that cause toxicity in sediments \nin situ. \n5.2.1.2 Level of Effort \nImplementation of this method requires a \nmoderate amount of laboratory effort, both to \nperform toxicity tests and to conduct TIE studies. \nThe effort expended in the TIE studies will be \nproportional to the complexity of analyses re- \nquired for the identification of suspected toxicants. \n5.2.1.2.1 Type of Sampling Required \nBulk sediment must be obtained and pore \nwater prepared from the sediments. Routine \nmeasurement of certain chemical components of \nthe pore water should be conducted. These \nmeasurements should include (but are not limited \nto) pH, hardness, alkalinity, salinity (where appro- \npriate), dissolved oxygen, sulfides, and ammonia. \nCertain of these variables, in particular pH, also \nshould be monitored in the bulk sediment. \n5.2.1.2.2 Methods \nThe framework for existing TIE procedures is \nsummarized below. Greater detail (e.g., with \nrespect to all possible results that could be gener- \nated) is available elsewhere (USEPA, 1988, \n1989b, 1989c), as are specific methods for per- \nforming sediment TIEs (USEPA, 1991b). \nToxic sediment samples can potentially con- \ntain thousands of chemicals, and usually only a \nhandful are responsible for the observed toxicity. \nThe goal of the TIE method is to identify quickly \nand cheaply the chemicals causing toxicity. \nHowever, components causing toxicity can vary \nwidely, and potential toxicants include cationic \nmetals, polar and nonpolar organics, and anionic \ninorganics, as well as ammonia or hydrogen \nsulfide. In addition, when multiple toxicants are \npresent, it must be possible to determine the \nproportion of the overall toxicity due to each \ntoxicant. \n5-2 \nS-Interstitial Water TIE Approach \nAfter preparation of pore water and perfor- \nmance of initial toxicity tests, the first step in the \nTIE is to separate toxic from nontoxic components \nin the pore water sample. To isolate the toxicants, \nsample manipulations and subsequent fractionation \ntechniques are used in combination with toxicity \ntests (toxicity tracking). Each fractionation step \nconsists of manipulations to identify the physi- \ncal/cbemical properties of the sample toxicants, \nthereby enabling selection of the \u201ccorrect\u201d analyti- \ncal technique for detecting, identifying, and \nquantifying the toxicants in the manipulated \nsamples. Because there may be significantly \nfewer chemical components in the manipulated \nsamples than in the original sample, the task of \ndeciding which component is causing the toxicity \nis much easier. The toxicity-based TIE approach \nenables direct relationships to be established \nbetween toxicants and measured analytical data \nbecause toxicants are tracked through all sample \nfractionations, using the most relevant detector \navailable, the organism. Establishing this relation- \nship ultimately results in highly efficient TIES. \nWith the toxicity-based TIE approach, detec- \ntion of synergistic and antagonistic interactions, as \nwell as matrix effects, for the toxicants is possible \nvia toxicity tracking. A priori knowledge of the \ntoxicants\u2019 behavior in the aqueous phase is not \nrequired. \nThe TIE approach is divided into three phases. \nPhase I consists of methods to identify the physi- \ncal/chemical nature of the constituents causing \nacute toxicity. Phase II describes fractionation \nschemes and analytical methods to identify the \ntoxicants, and Phase III presents procedures to \nconfirm that the suspected toxicants are the cause \nof toxicity. \nPhase I: Toxicant Characterixatlon-In Phase \nI, the physical/chemical properties of toxicants are \ncharacterized by performing manipulations to alter \nor render biologically unavailable generic classes \nof compounds with similar properties. Toxicity \ntests, performed in conjunction with the manipula- \ntions, provide information on the nature of the \ntoxicants. Successful completion of Phase I \noccurs when both the nature of the components \ncausing toxicity, as well as their consistent pres- ence in a number of samples, can be established. \nAfter Phase I, the toxicants can be tentatively \ncategorized as having chemical characteristics of \ncationic metals, nonpolar organics, polar organics, \nvolatiles, oxidants, and/or substances whose \ntoxicity is pHdependent. \nAn overview of the sample manipulations \nemployed in Phase I is shown in Figure S-l. Not \nshown in Figure 5-1, but performed on all sam- \nples, are routine water chemistry measuremats \nincluding pH, hardness, conductivity, and dis- \nsolved oxygen. These routine measurements are \nneeded for designirlg sample manipulations and \ninterpreting test data. The manipulations shown in \nFigure 5-1 are usually sufficient to characterize \ntoxicity caused by a single chemical. When \nmultiple toxicants are present, various combina- \ntions of the Phase I manipulations will most likely \nbe required for toxicant characterization. \nMany of the manipulations in Phase I require \nsamples that have been pH-adjusted. The adjust- \nment of pH is a powerful too1 for detecting cation- \nic and anionic toxicants since their behavior is \nstrongly influenced by PH. By changing pH, the \nratio of ionized to un-ionized species in solution \nfor a chemical is changed significantly. The \nionized and un-ionized species have different \nphysical/chemical properties as well as toxicities. \nIn Phase I, pH manipulations are used to examine \ntwo different questions: \nl Is the toxicity different at various pHs? \n. Does changing the pH, performing a \nsample manipulation, and then readjusting \nto ambient pH affect toxicity? \nThe graduated pH test examines the first question, \nand the pH adjustment. aeration, filtration, and \nsolid phase extraction (SPE) manipulations exam- \nine the second. \nIn the graduated pH test, the pH of a sample \nis adjusted within a physiologically tolerable range \n(e.g., pH 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0) before toxicity testing. \nIn many instances, the unionized form of a \ntoxicant is able to cross biological membranes \nmore readily than the ionized form and thus is \nmore toxic. This test is designed primarily for \nSediment Clnss~htk Methods Compendium \nF- 1 \n( TOXIC AQUEOUS SAMPLE ( \nEDTA \nChelation \nAeration I C 18 Solid Phase \n1 Extraction \n1 pH AdjFstment 1 Graduated pH \nTest \nAcid PHI Base p\u201d6 P\u201d7 ~\u201c8 \nFigure 51. Overview of the Phase 1 Toxicity Characterization Process. \nThe ambient pH of the sample is indicated as pH,. \n54 \nS-Interstitial Water TIE Appmach \nammonia, a relatively common toxicant whose \ntoxicity is extremely pH-dependent (USEPA, \n198%). However, different pH values can strong- \nly affect the toxicity of many common ionizable \npesticides, and also may influence the bioavail- \nability and toxicity of certain heavy metals and \nsurfactants (Campbell and Stokes, 1985; Doe et \nal., 1988). \nAeration tests are designed to determine \nwhether toxicity is attributable to volatile, oxidiz- \nable, or sublatable compounds. Samples at pH, \n(ambient pH), pH 3, and pH 11 are sparged with \nair for 1 h, readjusted to pH, and tested for toxici- \nty. The different pH values affect the ionization \nstate of polar toxicants, thus making them more or \nless volatile, and also affect the redox potential of \nthe system. If toxicity is reduced by air sparging \nat any of the pH values, the presence of volatile or \noxidizable compounds may be suggested. To \ndistinguish the former from the latter situation, \nfurther experiments are performed using nitrogen \nrather than air to sparge the samples. If toxicity \nremains the same, oxidizable materials are impli- \ncated; if toxicity is again reduced, volatile com- \npounds are suspect. The pH at which toxicity is \nreduced is important. if nitrogen sparging de- \ncreases toxicity at pH,, neutral volatiles are pres- \nent; if toxicity decreases at pH 11.0 or pH 3.0, \nbasic and acidic volatiles, respectively, are impli- \ncated. An additional process through which \naeration can remove sample toxicants is sublation, \nwhich is the movement of compounds through \naqueous solutions at the surface of the air bubbles, \noften followed by deposition on the aeration glass- \nware. Compounds that exhibit this behavior \ninclude resin acids and surfactants; in some in- \nstances it may be possible to implicate the pres- \nence of sublatable compounds by rinsing the \naeration glassware with clean laboratory dilution \nwater and testing this fraction (Ankley et aZ., \n1990b). \nFiltration provides information concerning the \namount of toxicity associated with filterable \ncomponents. In this test, samples at pH,, pH 3.0, \nand pH 11.0 are passed through 1-p glass fiber \nfilters, readjusted to pH,, and tested for toxicity. \nReductions in toxicity due to filtration could be \nrelated to factors such as decreased physical toxicity, rather than chemical toxicity (Chapman \net al., 1987), or removal of particle-bound toxi- \ncants, which could be important, particularly if \nfilter-feeding organisms such as cladocerans are \nthe test species. \nReversed-phase, solid-phase extraction (SPE) \nis designed to determine the extent of toxicity due \nto compounds that are relatively nonpolar at pH, \npH 3.0, or pH 9.0. This test, in conjunction with \nassociated Phase II analytical procedures, is an \nextremely powerful TIE tool. In this procedure, \nfiltered sample aliquots at pH, pH 3.0, and pH 9.0 \nare passed through small columns packed with an \noctadecyl (C,,) sorbent. At pH, the C,, sorbent \nwill remove neutral compounds such as certain \npesticides (Junk and Richard, 1988). By shifting \nionization equilibria at the low and bigh pH \nvalues, the SPE column also can be used to \nextract organic acids and bases (Wells and Mi- \nchael, 1987). During extraction, the resulting \npost-column effluent is collected and tested for \ntoxicity to determine whether the manipulation \nremoved toxicity and/or whether the capacity of \nthe column was exceeded. Following this, the \ncolumn is eluted with solvents, such as methanol, \nwhich then can be tested for recovery of toxicity. \nIf sample toxicily is decreased and subsequently \nrecovered in solvent elutions, a nonpolar toxicant \nwould be suspected. \nThe presence of toxicity due to cationic metais \nis tested through additions of ethylenediaminetet- \nraacetic acid (EDTA), a strong chelating agent that \nproduces nontoxic complexes with many metals. \nAs with SPE chromatography, the specificity of \nthe EDTA test for a class of ubiquitous toxicants \nmakes it a powerful TIE tool. Cations chelated by \nEDTA include certain forms of aluminum, barium, \ncadmium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, \nnickel, strontium, and zinc (Stumm and Morgan, \n1981). EDTA does not complex anionic forms of \nmetals, and only weakly chelates certain cationic \nmetals, such as silver, chromium, and thallium \n(Stumm and Morgan, 1931). \nThe oxidant reduction test is designed to \ndetermine the degree of toxicity associated with \nchemicals reduced, or in some instances chelated, \nby sodium thiosulfate. The toxicity of oxidants \nsuch as chlorine, bromine, iodine, and manganous \nSediment ClasGjiuatM1 Methods Compendium \nions is neutralized by sodium thiosulfate, and \nmetals such as copper, cadmium, and silver are \nchelated and rendered biologically unavailable \n(Hockett and Mount, 1990). Because sodium \nthiosulfate, like EDTA, has low toxicity to most \naquatic organisms, a relatively wide range of \nconcentrations can be tested. \nPhase II: Toxlunt Identification-Initial labo- \nratory work in Phase II focuses on isolation of \nthe toxicants using chemical fractionation tech- \nniques with toxicity tracking. The ideal isolation \nprocess would create a subsample that contains \none chemical, the toxicant. Depending on the \nnature of the toxicants, wide differences in the \ntechniques, as well as in the amount of effort \nrequired for fractionation, will occur. \nIn general, after fractionation, instrumental \nanalyses are performed on the toxic subsamples, \nand lists of identified chemicals are assembled \nfor each subsample. For each chemical in a list, \nan LC, value is obtained, usually from the \nliterature or occasionally from structure activity \nmodels (Institute for Biological and Chemical \nProcess Analyses, 1986). By comparing conceo- \ntrations of the identified chemicals to their IX, \nvalues, a list of suspect toxicants is made. This \nlist is then refined by actually determining LCW \nvalues for the suspects using the TIE test species. \nIf only one toxicant is present, it should be easily \nidentified. Fdr samples with multiple toxicants, \nidentification becomes significantIy more pro- \ntraded since interactions among toxicants may \nneed to be examined. If none of the suspected \ntoxicants appears to explain the toxicity, the true \ntoxicants were probably not detected during \ninstrumental analysis. Usually, additional separa- \ntion and associated concentration steps are re- \nquired to increase the analytical sensitivity for \ntoxicant identification. \nThe information obtained in Phase I provides \nthe analytical roadmarks for performing the \nfractionation and identification tasks in Phase II. \nTo illustrate the relationship between Phase I \ndata and the analytical approaches employed in \nPhase II, results for two typical Phase I TIE \nevaluations are presented in Table 5-l. The \nPhase II methods and approaches appropriate for these examples are discussed below. \nIn the first sample in Table 5-1, SPE reduced \ntoxicity. In Phase II, the SPE column is eluted \nwith graded, increasingly nonpolar methanol/- \nwater solutions, and toxicity testing is performed \non each fraction (Burkhard et al., 1990). Al- \nthough solvents other than methanol are routinely \nused in analytical work with q, chromatography \ncolumns, the low toxicity of methanol to aquatic \norganisms (e.g., Lc, 21.5 percent for dado- \ncelans) makes it a solvent of choice for toxicity \ntracking in the fractions. If no toxicity occurs in \nthe fractions, the toxicants have been lost and \nfurther characterization (Phase 1) work is re- \nquired. If toxicity occurs in the fractions, Phase \nII methods feature concentralion of the toxic \nmethanoltiater fractions; high performance \nliquid chromatography fractionation of the coo- \ncentrate (again with a CJmethanoVwater solvent \nsystem), with concurrent toxicity testing of the \nfractions; and, ultimately, identification of sus- \npected toxicants in the toxic fractions via gas \nchromatography/mass spectroscopy. For pore \nwater TIE, toxicity caused by high log L, oon- \npolar organics is often not elutable with metha- \nnol. In these cases, it is useful to elute the SPE \ncolumn with a less polar solvent (i.e., methylene \nchloride) (Schubauer-Berigan and Ankley, 1991). \nIn the second sample, both EDTA additions \nand SPE reduced toxicity. The reduction of \ntoxicity by EDTA strongly suggests the presence \nof toxic levels of cationic metals. Thus, Phase II \nprocedures would include both metal analyses \nand the concentration, fractionation, and identi- \nfication techniques described for nonpolar or- \nganics in the first example. If analyses identify \nspecific metals at concentrations high enough to \ncause toxicity, various mass balance procedures \n~8~1 be used to define the portion of the sample \ntoxicity due to the suspected metals and the \nportion of the toxicity due to the suspect noo- \npolar compounds. \nOnly a very small subset of possible Phase I \nresults is shown in Table 5-1, particularly when \none considers that three of the tests (aeration, \nfiltra!ioo, SPE) are conducted at three different \npH values. A complete discussion of the types \nof Phase I results that may be encountered and \n!54nterstitial Water TIE Appmach \nTable 5-l.

Confirma- \ntion is perhaps the most critical step of the TIE \nbecause procedures used in Phases I and II may \ncreate artifacts that could lead to erroneous con- \nclusions about the toxicants. Furthermore, there is \na possibility that substances causing toxicity are \ndifferent from sample to sample within a suppos- \nedly homogeneous geographic region. Phase III \nenables both situations to be addressed. The tools \nused in Phase IIl include correlation, relative \nspecies sensitivity, observation of symptoms, \nspiking, and mass balance techniques. In most \ncases, no single Phase III test is adequate to con- \nfirm suspects as the true toxicants; it is necessary \nto use multiple confirmation procedures. In the correlation, approach, observed toxicity \nis regressed against expected toxicity due to \nmeasured concentrations of the suspected toxicants \nin samples collected over time or from several \nsites within a location. For the correlation ap- \nproach to succeed, temporal or spatial variation \nhas to be wide enough to provide a range of \nvalues adequate for meaningful analyses. To use \nthe correlation approach effectively when there are \nmultiple suspect toxicants, it is necessary to \ngenerate data concerning the additive, antagonistic, \nand synergistic effects of the toxicants in ratios \nsimilar to those found in the samples. These data \nalso are needed for the spiking and mass balance \ntechniques described below. \nThe relative sensitivity of different test species \ncan be used to evaluate suspected toxicants. If \ntwo or more species exhibit markedly different \nsensitivities to a suspected toxicant in standard \nreference tests, and the same patterns in sensitivity \nare seen with the toxic pore water sample, this \n5-7 \nSehunt ClussifiAion Mt&ods Compendium \nprovides evidence for the validity of the suspect \nbeing the true toxic-ant. \nhother Phase fI1 procedure is observation of \nsymptoms (e.g., time to mortality) in poisoned \nanimals. Although this approach does not neces- \nsarily provide support for a given suspecl, it can \nbe used to provide evidence against a suspected \ntoxicant. If the symptoms observed in a standard \nreference test with a suspected toxicant differ \ngreatly from those observed with the pore water \nsample (which contains similar concentrations of \nthe suspected toxicant), this is strong evidence for \na misidentification. \nConfirmatory evidence also can be obtained \nby spiking samples with the suspect toxicants. \nWhile the results may not be conclusive, an \nincrease in toxicity by the same proportion as the \nincrease in concentration of the suspect toxicant in \nthe sample suggests that the suspect is correct. To \nobtain a proportional increase in toxicity from the \naddition of a suspect toxicant when in fact it is \nnot the true toxicant, both the true and suspect \ntoxicants would have to have very similar toxicity \nlevels and their effects would also have to be \nadditive. \nMass balance calculations a be used as \nconfirmation steps when toxicity can be at least \npartially removed from the pore water sample, and \nsubsequently recovered. This approach can be \nuseful in instances when SPE removes toxicity. \nT%e methanol fractions eluted from the SPE \ncolumn are evaluated individually for toxicity; \nthese toxicities are summed and then compared to \nthe total amount of toxicity lost from the sample. \nOther techniques, including alteration of water \nquality characteristics (e.g., pH, salinity) in a \nmanner designed to affect the toxicity of specific \ncompounds, and analysis of body burdens of \nsuspected toxicants in exposed animals, also can \nbe useful confirmation steps. \n5.2.1.23 Types of Data Required \nIn addition to the routine measurements de- \nsaiied above, biological response data, either acute \nor chronic, will be obtained. Specific data collected \nwill depend on the choice of test organism and \nendpoints. If the TIE process is initiated, the researcher will fit obtain data amcerning the \nphysicakhemical charackristics of the toxicants in \nthe pore water, followed by actual identification of \ntoxic compounds, and standard determination of \ntheir concentrations in the toxic samples (see Se.0 \ntion 5.2.12.2 above). \n5112.4 Necessary Harti and Skills \nPore water preparation and toxicity test proce \ndures are fairly straightforward and require corn- \nmonIy available equipment and facilities. Many of \nthe TIE procedures also require only routine fadli- \nties. However, certain TIE techniques require some \ndegree of advanced analytical capability (e.g., \natomic absorption spectroscopy, gas rhromatogra- \nphyhass spedroscopy). Similarly, although many \nof the routine toxicity tests require relatively little \ntraining, certain of the TIE procedures, in particular \nsome of the chemical analyses, require advanced \ntechnical expertise and experience. \n52.13 Adequacy of Document&m \n\u2018Ihe theoretical basis for using pore water to \nassess toxicity appears to be scientifically sound, \nand pore water has been used for sediment toxicity \nevaluation (Adams et d., 1985; Swartz et al., 1985, \n1988,199@ Knezovich and Harrison, 1988; Connell \net al., 1988; Giesy et ol., 1988; USEP& 198%; \nAnkIey et al, 199Oa, 1991a, 1991b; Hake et d, \n199Q Schubauer-Berigan and Ankley, 1991). \nToxicity tests that can be used are in many instances \nwell-documented, standard procedures (U.S. EPA, \n198Sa; 1985b). The TIE techniques involved, \nincluding those specifically for sediments, have been \ndocumented (USEPA, 1988,1989b, 1989c, 199la, \n1991b). Also, sediment TIES with pore water have \nbeen successfully demonstrated (AnkIey et al., \n199Oa, 1991b; Schubauer-Berigan et al., 1990, \nSchubauer-Berigan and Ankley, 1991). \n5.2.2 Applicability of Mctbod to Human \nHealth, Aquatic IXe, or WildIKe \nROtE!CtiOtl \nilk method can be used to predict acute and \nchronic (i.e., grouti or reproductive) effects of toxic \n5-8 54ntcrsCitid Wafer TIE Avach \nsediment on aquatic organisms and can identify \ntoxicants responsible for observed effects. The data \ngenerated thus can be used to design sediment \nremediation programs that would have an optimal \nlikelihood of success. These procedures are not \nsuitable, however, for evaluating human health \neffects or protecting wildlife, and they cannot be \nused to address bioconcentratable toxicants. \n5.23 Ability of Method to Generate \nNumerical Criteria for Specific \nChemicals \nPore water toxicity assessment, in conjunction \nwith successful TIE procedures, can be used to \ngenerate numerical criteria for toxic compounds in \nsediment pore water because the toxicants are \nactually identified. However, it must be estab- \nlished that compounds identified as being toxic to \ntest organisms in the laboratory are the same \ncompounds (both in form and concentration) \nresponsible for toxicity to organisms in field \nsituations. This relationship can be evaluated both \nthrough biosurveys (possibly in conjunction with \nanalysis of contaminant residues in organisms \ncollected from the field), and laboratory toxicity \ntests in which benthic organisms perceived to be \naffected in contaminated sediments in situ are \nexposed to toxicants identified in the pore water. \nBoth types of data also would be required for any \nsediment classification method based on toxicity \nor chemical analyses. \n53 USEFULNESS \n53.1 Environmental ApplicabiliCy \n5.3.1.1 Suitability for Diflerent Sediment Types \nThe pore water toxicity assessment approach \nis suitable for any sediment from which adequate \nquantities of pore water can be isolated. In typical \nsediments, 20-50 percent of the volume of the \nbulk sediment sample is pore water. For a com- \nplete Phase I characterization with a test species of \nrelatively small body size (e.g., cladocerans, larval \nfishes), approximately 15 L of pore water is re- \nquired. This translates into a bulk sediment requirement of 3-8 L Bulk sediment volumes \nneeded for Phase II identification will, of course, \nbe dependent on the toxicants present in the pore \nwater, but typical volumes required would be \nexpectedtorangefromlto2OL \n5.3.1.2 Suitability for Difirent Chemicals or \nThis approach appears to be suitable for \nvarious nonpolar organics, cationic metals, and \nammonia (Adams et al., 1985; Swartz et d., 1985, \n1988, 1990, Knezovich and Harrison, 1988; \nConnell et uZ., 1988; USEPA, 1989a; Ankley et \nal., 199Oa, 1991b; DiToro d al., 1990). The \napplicability of the approach to toxicants such as \npolar organics or extremely lipophilic compounds \nhas yet to be established. Also, the TIE proce- \ndure-s enable the evaluation of interactive (addi- \ntive, synergistic, antagonistic) effects among \nvarious toxicants present in pore water samples. \n5.3.1.3 Suitability for Predicting Effects on \nDiferent Organisms \nIf the TIE procedures successfully identify \nspecific toxicants responsible for sediment toxici- \nty, the impacts of these toxicants on various \nspecies of concern can be easily predicted, provid- \ned that there are data concerning the toxicity of \nthe identilied compounds to these species. Al- \nthough toxicity data may not be available for \ncertain benthic species, once suspect toxicants are \nidentified, it would be possible to generate toxicity \ndata for specific species of concern. \n5.3.1.4 Suitability for In-Place Pollutant Control \nThe pore water toxicity assessment method \nand associated TIE procedures could prove to be \na powerful tool for in-place pollutant control. Be- \ncause sediment toxicants are actually identified, it \nis possible to design remediation plans for toxi- \ncants from point sources or controllable nonpoint \nsources, and to routinely monitor the success of \nthese plans through continued assessm ent of pore \nwater for toxicity and specific chemical toxicants. \ns-9 \nSediment Class$c&m Methods ComFdium \n5.3.1.5 Suitability for Source Control \nBecause the potential exists for identifying \nspecific sediment toxicants, this method is ideal \nfor point source control, as well as controflabte \nnonpoint source inputs. \n5.3.1.6 Suitability for Dispsal Applications \nAs stated above, because specific sediment \ntoxicants can be identified, it would be possible to \nidentify potential hazards of contaminated sedi- \nments to aquatic organisms before disposal opera- \ntions, such as those associated with dredging \n(Ankley et al., 1991c). \n53.2 General Advantages and Umitatioas \n5.3.2.1 Ease of Use \nPore water preparation, routine chemical \nanalyses, toxicity tests, and certain of the TIE \nprocedures are reasonably straightforward and \nrequire relatively little technical expertise or \nextensive laboratory facilities. Because it is \npossible to work with aqueous samples, many of \nthe standard toxicity tests developed for toxicity \nassessment of surface waters and effluents can be \nused, in addition to tests with various benthic \nspecies (e.g., USEPA, 1985a, 1985b). However, \ninterpretation of results of certain of the TIE \nprocedures, as well as analytical support for the \nTIE work, requires advanced training and experi- \nence. Also, several TIE analyses require highly \nsensitive analytical instrumentation for procedures, \nsuch as atomic absorption spectroscopy and gas \nchromatography/mass spectroscopy. \n5.3.2.2 Relative Cost \nCost of the actual toxicity rest procedures is \nrelatively low. Cost of the TIE procedures will \nvary depending on the nature of the toxic com- \npounds; certain toxicants (e.g., pesticides) are \nmore costly to identify and quantify than others \n(e.g., ammonia). Also, identification and determi- \nnation of the effects of multiple toxicants in samples costs more than the identification of \nsingle toxicants. Thus, cost analysis for the TIE \nportion of the toxicity assessment is case-specific. \n5.3.2.3 Tendency to Be Conservative \nDepending on the species used and the end- \npoint evaluated, pore water toxicity tests can be as \nconservative as desired. However, acute pore \nwater toxicity tests described for sediment TfE are \nnot.meant to represent chronic or bioaccumulation \nendpoints. \n5.3.2.4 Level of Acceptance \nThe theoretical basis of pore water toxicity \nassessment is sound (Adams et al., 1985; Swartz \net al. 1985, 1988, 1990; Knezovich and Harrison, \n1988; Connell et al., 1988; USEPA, 1989a, \nDiToro et ol., 1990, Ankley et al., 1991a). The \nmost important advantage of using pore water as \na sediment test fraction, however, is the fact that \nit enables the application of recently developed \nTIE procedures for the identification of toxic \ncompounds in aqueous samples containing com- \nplex mixtures of chemicals (USEPA, 1988,198%, \n1989c, 1991a, 1991b). TIE procedures have \nproven to be extremely powerful tools for work \nwith both complex effluents and sediment pore \nwater (Ankley et al., 199Oa, 1991b; Kuehl et al., \n1991; Amato et al., 1991; Norberg-King et al., \n1991; Schubauer-Berigan and Ankley, 1991; \nAnkley and Burkhard, 1992). The ability to \nidentify specific compounds responsible for the \ntoxicity of contaminated sediments clearly could \nbe critical to the success of remediation. \n5.3.2.5 Ability to Be Implemented by \nL&oratories with Qpical Equipment \nand Handling Facilities \nPore water preparation, toxicity test pm- \ndures, and certain of the TIE methods are easily \nimplemented by laboratories with typical equip \nment and a moderate degree of expertise. Inter- \npretation of some TIE results requires additional \ntechnical training and experience, and certain of \nthe analytical procedures associated with TIE \n5-10 \nS-hzterstifial Water TIE Approach \nwork require both specialized training and analyti- \ncal instrumentation. \n5.3.2.6 Level of Effort Required to Generate \nResults \nThis procedure consists of field sampling, \npreparation of pore water, toxicity tests, and \nvarious TIE procedures. Depending on the \nresults of the TIE work, the level of effort ex- \npended to obtain potentially important data can \nbe relatively small. \n5.3.2.7 Degree to Which Results Lend \nThemselves to Interpretation \nBiological responses (i.e., toxicity) can be \neasily interpreted, and when properly performed, \nthe results of the TIE procedures can be straight- \nforward and easily interpreted; however, this is \ndependent on the complexity of the sample and \nthe number of compounds contribuling to sample \ntoxicity. \n5.3.2.8 Degree of Environmental Applicability \nPore water toxicity assessment and TIE \nprocedures are applicable to virtually all envi- \nronmental conditions and sediment types. \nMoreover, a wide variety of test organisms can \nbe evaluated with this approach. However, \nalthough data indicate that the toxicity and/or \nbioaccumulation of a variety of contaminants are \ncorrelated with their pore water concentrations, \nthere is no guarantee that this relationship exists \nfor all types of contaminants. For example, a \npotentially important route of exposure for \nhighly lipophilic compounds is thought to be via \ningestion of contaminated particles. This route \nis not addressed using pore water exposures. \nFinally, existing TIE procedures are applicable \nfor acutely toxic samples, and thus generally \nwould not be useful for identifying chronically \ntoxic sediment contaminants. \n5.3.2.9 Degree ofAccuracy and Precision \nBecause the procedures consist of laborato- ry-controlled experiments, results obtained are \nstatistically accurate and precise. \n5.4 STATUS \n5.4.1 Extent of Use \nVarious toxicity tests have been widely ap- \nplied to the evaluation of both freshwater and \nmarine sediments, and pore water is merely one of \nthe possible fractions that can be tested. Theoreti- \ncally, pore water appears to be appropriate for \nsediment toxicity assessment and there have been \nmany examples of its use for this purpose (Adams \net al., 1985; Swartz et al., 1985, 1988, 1990; \nGiesy et al., 1988; Knezovich and Harrison, 1988, \nConnell et al., 1988; USEPA, 1989a; Ankley, \n199Oa, 1991a, 1991b; DiToro et al., 1990, Hake \net al., 1990; Schubauer-Berigan and Ankley, \n1991). The TIE procedures (USEPA, 1988, \n1989b, 1989c, 1991a, 1991b) although developed \nonly relatively recently, already are widely used in \nboth research and regulatory programs. \n5.4.2 Extent to Which Approach Has Beea \nF&M-V&i&d \nBecause the procedure is relatively new, there \nhas been little field validation. \u2018Ihis area requires \nresearch, not only for the pore water TIE methods \ndesuibed herein, but for virtually any other sediment \nmethod involving toxicity tests or chemical analyses. \nSA.3 Reasms for Ihlted Use \nVarious sediment toxicity tests have been widely \nused; however, relatively few studies have evaluated \npore water toxicity. nis is primarily because the \ntheoretical basis for using pae water has only \nrecently been uitically evaluated. For this reaso& \nthere are no standard methods for pore water prcpa- \nration. Systematic TIE procedures for toxic aqueous \nsamples have only recently been developed and thus \nhave not yet been widely applied to the area of \nsediment toxicity assessment. Because avrent TIE \npmcedures cannot be used with bulk sediment sam- \nples, pore water appears to be the best fraction with \nSediment Classifktion Methods Compendium \nwhich to attempt to identify specific sediment \ncontaminants responsible for acute toxicity. \n5.4.4 Outlook for Future Use and Amount of \nDevelopment Yet Needed \nThe outlook for this approach is extremely \npromising because it is the only method currently \navailable that enables the identification of specific \ncompounds responsible for sediment toxicity with \nsome degree of certainty. This information could \nbe critical to the success of remediation. Howev- \ner, as with all of the existing sediment methods, \nfurther development is needed, particularly in the \nfollowing areas: \n. The development of standard and scientif- \nically sound techniques for pore water \nisolation; \nm Further characterization of relationships \nbetween sediment toxicity h sihc and the \ntoxicity of sediment pore water in the \nlaboratory for different classes of camp- \nounds; and \nm The development of TIE procedures to \nidentify chronically toxic compounds in \naqueous samples. \nResearch in all these areas is ongoing at ERL \nDuluth. \nFor more information please contact: \nGerald Ankley and Nelson Thomas \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nEnvironmental Research Laboratory \n6201 Congdon Boulevard \nDuluth, MN 55804 \n(218) 7205603 \nMary K.

Zarba \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n401 M Street, SW (WH-586), Washington, DC 20460 \n(202) 260-1326 \nThe equilibrium partitioning (EqP) approach \nfocuses on predicting the chemical interaction \namong sediments, interstitial water (i.e., the \nwater between sediment particles), and contami- \nnants. Based on correlations with toxicity, \ninterstitial water concentrations of contaminants \nappear to be better predictors of biological \neffects than do bulk sediment concentrations. \nThe EqP method for generating sediment quality \ncriteria is based on predicted contaminant con- \ncentrations in interstitial water. Chemically \ncontaminated sediments are expected to cause \nadverse biological effects if the predicted inter- \nstitial water concentration for a given contami- \nnant exceeds the chronic water quality criterion \nfor that contaminant. \n6.1 SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS \nSpecific applications of EqP-based sediment \nquality criteria are under development. The \nprimary use of EqP-based sediment criteria will \nbe to identify and prevent risks associated with \ncontaminants. Because the regulatory needs \nvary widely among and within U.S. EPA offices \nand programs, EqP-based sediment quality \ncriteria will be used in a variety of ways. \nEqP-based numerical sediment quality \ncriteria would likely be used directly to assess \nrisk and would be applied in a tiered approach \nIn tiered applications, concentrations of sediment \ncontaminants that exceed sediment quality \ncriteria would be considered as causing unac- \nceptable impacts. Further testing may or may \nnot be required, depending on site-specific and \nprogram-specific conditions. Sediment contami- \nnants at concentrations less than the sediment \ncriteria would not be of concern. However, \nsediments would not be considered safe in cases where they are suspected to contain other con- \ntaminants at concentrations above safe levels, \nbut for which no sediment criteria exist. \nSynergistic, antagonistic, or additive effects \nof multiple contaminants in the sediments may \nalso be of concern. Additional testing in other \ntiers of the evaluation approach, such as bio- \nassays, could be required to determine whether \nthe sediment is safe. It is likely that such \ntesting would incorporate site-specific consider- \nations. \n6.1.1 Current Use \nSpecific regulatory uses of EqP-based sedi- \nment quality criteria are under development and \nwill be articulated in the Contaminated Sediment \nManagement Strategy. The Science Advisory \nBoard (SAB) has completed the review of this \napproach for nonionic organic contaminants. \nBased on the findings of this review, the method \nwill be used for developing national sediment \nquality criteria. (The first five sediment quality \ncriteria will be proposed in the Federal Register \nshortly for public comment.) At the present \ntime, the criteria are for the protection of ben- \nthic organisms. The methodology for develop- \ning sediment criteria for metal contaminants will \nbe presented to the SAB for review in 1993. \nThe range of potential applications of the EqP \napproach is large because the approach accounts \nfor contaminant bioavailability and can be used \nto evaluate most sediments. \nDraft sediment criteria values have been \ndeveloped for a variety of organic compounds \nusing the EqP approach. In pilot studies at a \nvariety of contaminated sediment sites at which \nsite characterization and evaluation activities \nwere undertaken, the draft criteria were used in \nthe following ways: \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \n\u2022 Identify extent of contamination; \n\u2022 Assess the risks or potential risks associ- \nated with the sediment contamination; \n\u2022 Identify responsible parties and the need \nfor source controls; and \n\u2022 Identify the environmental benefit associ- \nated with a variety of remedial options. \nIn addition, a number of states have used draft \nEqP-based sediment criteria to evaluate the poten- \ntial effects of sediment contaminants found in \naquatic habitats. \n6.1.2 Potential Use \nPotential applications of the EqP approach \ninclude a variety of ongoing activities conducted \nby the U.S. EPA. EqP-based sediment quality \ncriteria could play a major role in the identifi- \ncation, monitoring, and cleanup of contaminated \nsediment sites on a national basis. This is true, in \npart, because EqP-based SQC establish a direct \ncause-and-effect relationship between a contami- \nnant concentration and biological impacts. They \ncould also be used to ensure that uncontaminated \nsites remain uncontaminated. In some cases, such \nsediment criteria alone will be sufficient to iden- \ntify and establish cleanup levels for contaminated \nsediments. In other cases, it will be necessary to \nsupplement the sediment criteria with biological \nsampling, testing, or other types of analysis before \na decision can be made. \nEqP-based sediment criteria will be particular- \nly valuable at sites where sediment contaminant \nconcentrations are gradually increasing. In such \ncases, criteria will permit an assessment of the \nextent to which unacceptable contaminant concen- \ntrations are being approached or have been ex- \nceeded. Comparisons of field measurements to \nsediment criteria will be a reliable method for \nproviding an early warning of a potential problem. \nSuch an early warning would provide an opportu- \nnity to take corrective action before adverse \nimpacts occur. Although sediment criteria developed using \nthe EqP approach are similar in many ways to \nexisting water quality criteria, their applications \nmay differ substantially. In most cases, contami- \nnants in the water column need only be controlled \nat the source to eliminate unacceptable adverse \nimpacts. In contrast, contaminated sediments \noften have been in place for quite some time, and \ncontrolling the source of that pollution (if the \nsource still exists) will not be sufficient to allevi- \nate the problem. Safe removal, treatment, or \ndisposal of contaminated sediments can also be \ndifficult and expensive. For this reason, it is \nanticipated that EqP-based sediment criteria will \nrarely be used as mandatory cleanup levels. \nRather, they will likely be used to predict or \nidentify the degree and spatial extent of problems \nassociated with contaminated areas, and thereby \nfacilitate regulatory decisions. \n6.2 DESCRIPTION \n6.2.1 Description of Method \nConcentrations of contaminants in the intersti- \ntial water correlate very closely with toxicity, \nwhereas concentrations of contaminants bound to \nthe sediment particles do not. The EqP method \nfor generating sediment criteria involves predicting \ncontaminant concentrations in the interstitial water \nand comparing those concentrations to quality \ncriteria. If the predicted sediment interstitial water \nconcentration for a given contaminant exceeds its \nrespective chronic water quality criterion, then the \nsediment would be expected to cause adverse \neffects. \nThe processes that govern the partitioning of \nchemical contaminants among sediments, inter- \nstitial water, and biota are better understood for \nsome kinds of chemicals than for others. Con- \ncentrations of sulfides and organic carbon have \nbeen identified as primary factors that control \nphase associations, and therefore bioavailability, \nof trace metals in sediments. However, models \nthat can use these factors to predict research are \nnot fully developed. Mechanisms that control \nthe partitioning of polar organic compounds are \n6-2 6-EqP Approach \nalso poorly understood. Polar organic contami- \nnants, however, are not generally considered to \nbe a significant problem in sediments. Parti- \ntioning of nonionic organic compounds between \nsediments and interstitial water is highly corre- \nlated with the organic carbon content of sedi- \nments. Also, the toxicity of nonionic organic \ncontaminants in sediments is highly dependent \non their interstitial water concentrations. Conse- \nquently, to date, the EqP approach is well \ndeveloped for nonionic organic contaminants \n-.nd is in the process of development for trace \nmetals. \nInterstitial water concentrations can be \ncalculated using partition coefficients for speci- \nfic nonionic organic chemicals and criteria con- \ntinuous concentrations from WQC documents. \nThe sediment quality criterion for a specific \nchemical is defined as the solid phase concentra- \ntion that will result in an uncomplexed intersti- \ntial water concentration equal to the chronic \nwater quality criterion for that chemical. The \nrationale for using water quality criteria as the \neffect concentrations for bentbic organisms is \nthat the sensitivity range for bentbic organisms \nappears to be similar to the sensitivity range for \nwater column organisms. Moreover, partition \ncoefficients for a wide variety of contaminants \nare available. \nThe calculation procedure for nonionic \norganic contaminants is as follows: \nwhere: \ncWQC = \nrSQC = \n16 = Criterion continuous concen- \ntration \nSediment quality criterion \n@g/kg sediment) \nPartition coefficient for the \nchemical (L&g sediment) \nbetween sediment and water. \nAlthough the method for developing sediment \ncriteria for nonionic organic contaminants has \nbeen identified, continuous refinement of the \nmethodology is expected. 6.2.1.1 Objectives ad Assumptions \nThree principal assumptions underlie use of \nthe EqP-based approach to establisb sediment \nquality criteria: \nFor sediment-dwelling organisms, the \nuncomplexed interstitial water concentra- \ntion of a chemical correlates with ob- \nserved biological effects across sediment \ntypes, and the concentration at which \neffects are observed is the same as that \nobserved in a water-only exposure. \nPartitioning models permit calculation of \nuncomplexed interstitial water concentra- \ntions of the chemical phases of sediments \ncontrolling availability. \nBenthic organisms exhibit a range of \nsensitivities to chemicals that is similar to \nthe range of sensitivities exhibited by \nwater column organisms. \nData exist supporting each of these assumptions. \n6.2.1.2 Level 0fEfior-t \n6.2.1.2.1 Type of Sampling Required \nSufficient sediment chemistry sampling is \nrequired to adequately characterize the area of \nconcern. Total organic carbon concentrations are \nalso needed, preferably for each sampling station. \n6.2.1.2.3 Types of Data Required \nAnalyses are needed to determine the concen- \ntrations of the contaminants of concern in the \nsediment (bulk sediment analysis) and the concen- \ntrations of organic carbon in the sediment. \n6.2.1.2.4 Necessary Hardware and Skills \nThe investigator must be able to design an \nappropriate sampling study, conduct bulk sediment \nanalyses, operate a pocket calculator, and under- \nstand developed values and what they protect. \n6-3 \nS&nent Classification Methods Compendium \n6.2.1.3 Adequacy of Documentation \nThe method is very well documented (see \nSection 6.5). \n6.2.2 Appikability of Metbod to Human \nHealth, Aquatic Ufe, or Wildlife \nProtection \nAt the present time SQC do not address \nbioaccumulative impacts to aquatic life, wildlife, \nand human health. Efforts are under way to \nderive criteria protective of these endpoints. \n6.23 Ability of Metbod to Generate \nNumerical Criteria for Specifk \nChemicals \nThe EqP method generates numerical criteria \nfor a number of nonionic organic chemicals. A \nmethodology for developing sediment criteria for \nmetal contaminants is being developed. Draft \ncriteria to be proposed in the Federal Register \nwere developed for endrin, phenanthrene, fiuor- \nanthene, dieldrin, and acenaphthene. It is expect- \ned that three to five additional sediment criteria \nwill be issued each subsequent year. \nMethods for developing sediment criteria for \nmetal contaminants are under development and are \nexpected to be reviewed by the SAB in 1993. \n63 USEFULNESS \n63.1 Environmental ApplicablIity \nOne of the principal reasons for selecting the \nEqP approach is that it is applicable in a wide \nvariety of aquatic systems, which is a prerequisite \nfor the development of national sediment quality \ncriteria. \n6.3.1.X Suitability for Different Sediment Types \nAlthough aspects of the EqP method are still \nunder development, it is expected that sediment criteria for nonionic contaminants developed using \nthis approach will be applicable to all types of \nsediments found in both freshwater and marine \nenvironments with organic carbon concentrations \nSo.2 percent organic carbon. Additional work is \nneeded to clarify the best use of the EqP approach \nfor sediments with less than 0.2 percent organic \ncarbon. \n6.3.2.2 Suitability for Difirent Chemicals or \nClasses of Chemicals \nThe EqP method for developing sediment \ncriteria has been modified for different types of \ncontaminants. Nonionic, ionic, and metal contam- \ninants all interact with sediment particles in \ndifferent ways, and partitioning models have to be \nmodified to account for these differences. The \ntechnical approach for developing sediment cri- \nteria for nonionic organic contaminants has been \nwell developed and is under peer review. The \ntechnical approach for developing sediment ai- \nt&a for metal contaminants is under development \nand is expected to undergo peer review in 1993. \nIonic contaminants are not believed to cause major \nproblems in sediments, but work plans for sedi- \nment criteria development methods for these \ncompounds have been written. \n6.3.1.3 Suitabili~ for Predicting Effects on \nDifferent Organisms \nAs indicated above (see Section 6.2.1), the \nEqP approach is based on predicted interstitial \nwater concentrations of nonionic organic con- \ntaminants, and comparisons of these concentra- \ntions with chronic water quality criteria. Typi- \ncally, water quality criteria are based on toxicity \ninformation (e.g., median lethal or median effec- \ntive concentrations) for a wide number of species \nand are set low enough to be protective of at least \n95 percent of the species tested. Consequently, \nexposure levels that are predicted using the EqP \napproach can be compared with a range of toxic \neffects values that are representative of the diffef- \nent kinds of organisms on which water quality \ncriteria are based. \n64 \n6-EqP Approach \n6.3.1.4 Suitability for In-Place Pollutant \nControl \nThe EqP method is suitable for in-place \npollution control because it can be used to \nidentify locations where concentrations of indi- \nvidual contaminants are causing adverse effects. \nTarget cleanup levels can be identified, and the \nsuccess of cleanup activities can be determined. \n6.3.1.5 Suitability for Source Control \nThe EqP method is suitable for source \ncontrol. This metbod predicts the concentration \nof a contaminant above which adverse impacts \nare likely. A direct measure of biological \neffects is not needed to identify safe levels. \n6.3.1.6 Suitability for Disposal Applications \nThe EqP method is suitable for predicting \nthe effects that contaminated sediments may \nhave if moved to an aquatic site. It is not \napplicable to contaminated sediments that are \ndisposed of at upland sites. \n6.3.2 General Advantages and Limitations \nThe EqP approach offers the following \nadvantages: \nn It is consistent with existing water qual- \nity criteria; \nn It establishes a cause-and-effect relation- \nship; \nm It relates risks to specific substances, \nand it can be used to identify probable \nspecies at risk; \nn It is applicable across all types of sedi- \nments and in all types of aquatic envi- \nronments, including lentic, lofic, marine, \nand estuarine environments; \nn Only site-specific chemistry data are needed; n \nm \nm \nm \nThe E \nways: \nl \nl \nl \nl Site-specific or station-specific sediment \ncriteria can be calculated as soon as sedi- \nment chemistry data are available; \nIt incorporates the large quantities of data \nthat were used in the development of \nwater quality criteria; \nIt can be incorporated into existing regu- \nlatory mechanisms with little or no need \nfor additional staffing or skills, \nThe equilibrium partitioning theory on \nwhich it is based is well developed; \nIt can be modified easily to accommodate \nsite-specific circumstances; \nIt can be used with additional develop- \nment to identify risks to humans and \nwildlife that may occur as a result of \nbioaccumulation; and \nIt identifies the degree of sediment con- \ntamination and permits an assessment of \nwhether contaminant concentrations are \napproaching an effects level. \nqP approach is limited in the following \nSediment criteria developed using this ap- \nproach do not address possible synergis- \ntic, antagonistic, or additive effects of \ncontaminants; \nInterim and draft sediment criteria pres- \nently exist for only 12 contaminants at \nthis time; \nThe technical approach for developing \nsediment criteria for metal contaminants is \nstill under development; \nSediment quality criteria for nonionic \nchemicals apply to sediments that have an \norganic carbon concentration a.2 percent; \nand \n6-5 \nSedimenf Classification Methods Compendium \nn Sufficient water-only toxicity data do not \nexist for all aMaminants of concern. \n6.3.2.1 Ease of Use \nThe calculation of site-specific sediment criteria \nis relatively easy, provided that sediment chemistry \ndata adequately characterizing the site, a partition \ncoefficient, and water quality criteria protective of \nthe desired organism are available. \n6.3.2.2 Relatix? Cost \nBecause site-specific biological data are not \nneeded, the costs associated with this method \ndepend primarily on the cost of collecting site- \nspecific chemistry data. \n6.3.2.3 Tendency to Be Consemtive \nSediment criteria are derived using the chronic \nwater quality criteria as effect levels. Hence, the \nlevels of protection afforded by sediment aiteria are \nsimilar to those of water quality criteria. In general, \nwater quality criteria are deemed to be protective of \n95 percent of the organisms most of the time. Each \nSQC is bracketed with levels of uncertainty. \n6.3.2.4 Level of Acceptance \nThe EqP approach and its use in deriving \nsediment quality criteria are the result of the efforts \nof many scientists who represent a variety of federal \nagencies, industries, environmental organizations, \nuniversilies, U.S. EPA laboratories, state agencies, \nand other institutions. These scientists were in- \nvolved in the selection of the EqP approach for \ngenerating sediment criteria and have also played a \nrole in development of the method. Papers that \ndiscuss various aspeas of this effort have been \npresented at scientific conferences. \n6.3.2.5 Ability to Be Implemented by Laboratories \nwith Typical Equipment and Handling \nFacilities \nNo special laboratory facilities or requirements \nare needed. Sediment chemistry analysis is all that \nis required. 6.3.2.6 Level of Effort Required to Generate \nResults \nThe necessary level of effort varies substan- \ntially from site to site and is dependent on many \nfactors. Compared with other methods, the EqP \nmethod generates results quickly and more cost- \neffectively. No site-specific biological data are re- \nquired. \n6.3.2.7 Degree to Which Results Lend \nThemselves \u2018to Interpretarion \nAll sediment evaluation procedures require \nsome level of interpretation. However, a sediment \ncriterion that is bracketed with an appropriate \ndegree of uncertainty can provide pertinent infor- \nmation. For example, sediment chemistry data \nthat identify concentrations below the conservative \neffect level for a particular contaminant could be \ndeemed safe for that contaminant. A contaminant \nconcentration above the upper uncertainty level \ncould be identified immediately as contaminated, \nand some degree of contamination could be \nassigned to those sediments for the individual \ncontaminant. Sediments whose concentration of \na particular contaminant falls within the degrees of \nuncertainty could require more detailed interpreta- \ntion and possibly additional testing. \n6.3.2.8 Degree of Environmental Applicability \nEqP-based sediment quality criteria can be. \napplied directly to any contaminated sediment \ncontaining ~0.2 percent organic carbon and non- \nionic chemicals for which criteria are available. \nExtensive data analysis and site-specific biological \ndata are not required to use sediment criteria \ndeveloped using this method. (In some cases \nthese attributes may nonetheless be desirable.) As \na result, the EqP method can be considered envi- \nronmentally applicable in some cases. Because a \nwide variety of contaminated sediment site-s exist, \nabsolute statements regarding environmental \napplicability are difficult to make. However, the \nEqP method would be appropriate in many situa- \ntions to predict bioavailability, bioaccumulation, \nand biological effects. \n64 \nii-E9P Approach \n6.3.2.9 Degree of Accuracy and Precision \nBach sediment criterion value developed using \nthe EqP method will have an associated degree of \nuncertainty, which will vary from criterion to \ncriterion. The principal uncertainties associated \nwith sediment criteria developed using the EqP \nmethod are those associated with partition coeffi- \ncients. Hence, each developed sediment criterion \nshould be and is bracketed with uncertainty, \nthereby providing decision-makers with a greater \nunderstanding of the meaning of the developed \nvalues. \n6.4 \nfor Sl-ATUS \nThe method for developing sediment criteria \nnonionic organic contaminants has been \ndeveloped and has been reviewed by the SAB on \nhvo separate occasions. Guidelines and guidance \non the regulatory use of sediment criteria are \nunder development. The method for developing \nsediment criteria for metal contaminants is being \ninvestigated and results are promising. The metals \nmethod is expected to be sufficiently well devel- \noped for peer review by 1993. \n6.4.1 Extent of Use \nSpecific regulatory uses for EqP-based sedi- \nment quality criteria are being developed. A \nformal framework for the application of sediment \ncriteria is not expected until EPA completes its \neffort to develop a contaminated sediment man- \nagcment strategy. The range of potentia1 applica- \ntions is very large because the need for evaluating \npotentially contaminated sediments arises in many \ncontexts. \nInterim sediment criteria values were devel- \noped for a variety of organic compounds. These \nvalues were used in a pilot study at a number of \nsites where site characterization and evaluation \nactivities were conducted. The interim criteria \nwere used in three ways: n To identify the extent of contamination \nand responsible parties; \nl To assess the risks associated with sedi- \nment contamination; and \nn To identify the environmental benefits \nassociated with a variety of remedial \noptions. \nA number of States have used interim and \ndraft sediment criteria to evaluate the potential \neffects of several contaminants found in sediments \nin state waters. The methodologies for deriving \nsediment criteria have been used in a variety of \nsituations including the evaluation of dredged \nmaterial, Superfund site assessments, and the \nidentification of appropriate cleanup levels for \ncontaminated sediment sites. \n6.4.2 Extent to Which Approach Has Been \nField-Validated \nConsiderable effort has been made by EPA to \nuse field sites as part of the criteria validation \neffort and to aid in designing regulatory programs. \nTable 6-1 lists ongoing and completed studies \nwhere SQC are being used to directly support \nsediment activities. In addition to these siles, \nthere are other sites and situations (completed, \nongoing, and planned) where the BqP is being \napplied to field situations. Although these efforts \nare not invoived with criteria development efforts, \nthey do provide valuable data on the appropriate- \nness of the EqP. \nI1 needs to be understood, however, that \u201cfield \nvalidation\u201d does not describe a specific experimen- \ntal protocol. The idea is to find a site that is \ncontaminated with a single chemical and deter- \nmine whether the benthic populations are degraded \nwhen the SQC is exceeded. However, there are \npractical difficulties. Such a field site contamin- \nated with only one chemical must be found, and \nthere can be no ongoing sources of the chemical \nsince the exposure should be only from the se& \nment. A gradient of chemical concentration that \nspans the SQC concentration is necessary. The \n6-7 \nSediment Classijicntion Methods Compendium \nTable 61. Ongoing rnd Completed Studies Using SM. \nsediment type must be essentially uniform in the \ngradient so that only chemical concentration is \nchanging. The benthic population must be plenti- \nful enough so that population degradation can be \nobserved as the SQC is exceeded. In spite of the \ndifficulties, major field efforts are presently under \nway. \nAn intermediate level of field validation is \nprovided by the benthic colonization experiments. \nThe experimental design is desaibed above. The \npopulations that develop are determined entirely \nby natural recruitment. The uniformity of sedi- \nment type is guaranteed by the experimental \ndesign. The experiments last from 2 to 4 months \nso that\u2019 the sediment can properly be called a \u201cnatural\u201d sediment. Three benthic colonization \nexperiments have been performed using spiked \nsediments. The data analysis, which is partially \ncomplete, indicates that the experiments are \nconsistent with the SQC for the chemicals being \ntested. \nA third type of field validation is proceeding \nas well. It is based on the notion that although it \nis not possible to prove the validity of SQC \n(continual accumulation of evidence in favor of its \nvalidity does not guarantee that all evidence will \nalways be supportive), it is possible to prove that \nit is invalid.

Therefore, EqP-based sediment quality \ncriteria will be used much as water quality criteria \nare being used to define environmentally accept- \nable concentrations. Sediment quality criteria, \nalong with sediment toxicity tests analogous to \nwater quality criteria and whole-effluent toxicity \ntests, will play a major role in EPA\u2019s management \nof contaminated sediment. \n6.5 REFERENCES \nUSEPA.

Concentrations of unacceptable tissue \nresidues may be derived from toxicity tests per- \nformed during generation of chronic water quality \ncriteria, from bioconcentration factors derived \nfrom the literature or generated by experimen- \ntation, or by comparison with human health risk \ncriteria associated with consumption of contami- \nnated aquatic organisms. The tissue residue \napproach generates numerical criteria and is most \napplicable for nonpolar organic and organometallic \ncompounds. \n7.1 SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS \n7.1.1 Current Use \nTissue residues of chemical contaminants in \naquatic organisms, particularly fish, are frequently \nused as measures of water quality in both fresh- \nwater and marine systems. The tendency of \norganisms to bioaccumulate chemicals from water \nand food is one of the factors used in establishing \nnational water quality criteria (WQC) for the \nprotection of aquatic life (Stephan et al., 1985). \nNonpolar organic chemicals, which may bio- \naccumulate to levels toxic to organisms or render \norganisms unfit for human food, generally will also be found as sediment contaminants. Hydro- \nphobic organic chemicals preferentially distribute \ninto organic carbon in sediment- and lipid in \naquatic biota. The tissue residue approach has \nbeen used recently to establish the amount of \nreduction of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin \n(TCDD) concentration in Lake Ontario sediments \nnecessary to attain acceptable TCDD levels in fish \n(Cook et al., 1990). The acceptable sediment \nTCDD concentration is being used as a sediment \ncriterion to determine the remedial action neces- \nsary to reduce the incremental loading of TCDD \nfrom the Hyde Park Superfund site to Lake Ontar- \nio (Carey et al., 1989). Tissue residues of benthic \norganisms have also been used in some regulatory \nactions, such as the assessment of bioaccumulation \npotential of dredged materials (USACE, 1991). \n7.1.2 Potential use \nAlthough tissue residues have been used more \ncommonly to determine the potential for bioaccu- \nmulation of chemical contaminants from sediments \nand dredged materials, they also provide an excel- \nlent measure of \u201ceffective exposure dose\u201d: a mea- \nsure of an organism\u2019s actual exposure over time to \na pollutant of concern. This exposure measure may \nbe related to the dose expected at the water quality \ncriterion or related directly to the potential for \nproducing chronic toxic effects. Given the ability to \nmeasure or predict tissue residues resulting from \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \nexposures in contaminated sediment systems, it is \npossible to establish sediment criteria based on \nresidue-toxicity effects relationships. These rela- \ntionships can provide a basis for sediment criteria \nthat are free of uncertainties normally associated \nwith organism exposures and sediment contaminant \nbioavailability. This is especially true when in situ \nmeasurements provide the basis for the sediment \nresidue link to the residue-toxic effect relationship. \nOne example of tissue residue-toxic effects \nlinkage is the relationship between the failure of \nGreat Lakes lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to \nreproduce and bioaccumulation of TCDD and \nnon-ortho substituted PCBs (Mac, 1988). Labora- \ntory studies have shown significant mortality of \nlarvae when lake trout ova contain as little as 50 ppt \n2,3,7,8-TCDD (Cook et al., 1990; Walker et of., \n1991). This residue level is found in Lake Ontario \nlake trout that have not successfully reproduced \nnaturally for many years. On the basis of TCDD \ntoxic equivalents for organochlorine components \nhaving the same mode of toxic action, residues in \nlake trout from Lakes Ontario and Michigan may \nprovide a measure of the reduction in sediment \ncontamination necessary to reduce fish tissue con- \ncentrations to a threshold presumed to allow repro- \nduction. The same approach can be used for \nbenthic organisms, which may have greater intersite \nvariations in residue levels than do fish because of \nbenthic organisms\u2019 closer association with \nsediments. \n7.2 DESCRIPTION \n7.2.1 Description of Method \nThe tissue residue approach involves the estab- \nlishment of safe sediment concentrations for individ- \nual chemicals or classes of chemicals by deter- \nmining the sediment chemical concentration that will \nresult in acceptable tissue residues. This process \ninvolves two steps: (1) linking toxic effects to resi- \ndues (dose-response relationships) and (2) linking \nchemical residues in specific organisms to sediment \nchemical contamination concentrations (exposure \nrelationships). Methods to derive unacceptable \ntissue residues include at least three approaches: \u2022 The water quality titerion-residue \napproach; \n\u2022 The experimental approach; and \n\u2022 The human health approach. \nEach of these approaches is described briefly below. \nWater Quality Criterion-Residue Approach-A \nrapid approach for determining acceptable concen- \ntrations of tissue residues involves establishing \nmaximum permissible tissue concentrations \n(MPTCs) expected for organisms at the chronic \nwater quality criterion concentration previously \nestablished for a specific pollutant. MPTCs, when \nnot available through residue measurements obtained \nwith toxicity tests used for water quality criteria, can \nbe obtained by multiplying the water quality criteri- \non by an appropriate bioconcentration factor (BCF) \nobtained from the literature. When a reliable \nempirical BCF is not available, the BCF may be \npredicted from an octanol-water partition coefficient \nor a bioconcentration kinetic model. Thus, the \nabsence of a water quality criterion for a chemical \ndoes not eliminate this approach as long as appropri- \nate chronic toxicity test data are available for the \nspecies of interest. \nExperimental Approach-Tissue residue-toxic \neffects linkages can be established through a series \nof chronic dose-response experiments or field \ncorrelations. Although this approach has the advan- \ntage of directly determining the tissue residue-toxic \neffects linkages, it can be relatively time consuming \nand costly to implement for a large number of \npollutants. The experimental approach should be \nused to test the assumptions of the water quality \ncriterion-residue approach and to supplement the \nexisting tissue residue-toxic effects database. The \nexperimental work can be closely coupled with the \nexperiments conducted under the bulk sediment \ntoxicity test approach to deriving sediment quality \ncriteria (see Chapter 3, Bulk Sediment Toxicity Test \nApproach). \nHuman Health Approach-Human health risk \nfrom consumption of freshwater fish or seafood \n7-2 \n?--Tissue Residue Apprauch \nmay be used as the criterion for tissue residue \nacceptability. A sediment quality criterion for a \nspecific compound can be derived by establishing \nan acceptable human risk level (e.g., an excess \nhuman cancer risk of 1x10\u201d) and then back-calcu- \nlating to the sediment concentration that would \nresult in tissue residues associated with this level \nof risk. The human health approach can generate \nsediment quality criteria lower for carcinogenic \ncompounds (e.g., PCBs, dioxins, benzo(a)pyrene) \nthan those criteria derived from ecological end- \npoints. \nThe choice of method to determine a quantita- \ntive tissue residue-sediment contamination level \nrelationship depends on the specific pollutants, \norganisms, and water systems of concern, as well \nas the regulatory approach (e.g., remedial action, \nwasteload allocation, Superfund enforcement). \nThe linkage between organism residue and sedi- \nment chemical concentration can be made from \nsite-specific measurements of sediment-organism \npartition coefficients (Kuehl et al., 1987); fugacity \nor equilibrium partitioning model (Clark et al., \n1988); predictions of organism residues; or pharm- \nacokinetic-bioenergetic model predictions of \norganism residues that result from uptake from \nfood chain, waler, and sediment contact \n(Thornann, 1989). The residue approach works \nbest for aquatic ecosystems that are at or close to \nsteady state with respect to the distribution of \nchemicals between biotic and abiotic components. \nSteady-state conditions are common for most \nsediment contaminants because of their persistence \nand tendency to exert long-term rather than \nepisodic bioaccumulation and toxic effects. \n7.2.1.1 Objectives and Assumptions \nThe objective of this approach is to generate \nnumerica sediment quality criteria based on \nacceptable levels of chemical contaminants in \nsediment-exposed biota. This objective is \nparallel to that of the water quality criteria, \nexcept that organism residues provide measures \nof exposure to chemical contaminants rather than \nwater concentrations of contaminants. By using \ntissue residues rather than interstitial water \nconcentrations to measure dose, as in the equi- librium partitioning approach (Chapter 5), this \nmethod does not require that the organism be at \nthermodynamic equilibrium with respect to the \nsediment contamination level. The site-specific \nresidue approach is powerful because it does not \nrequire knowledge of bioavailability relation- \nships for each organism in the system. All \ninteraction pathways between sediment and \norganisms are incorporated in the determination \nof organism-to-sediment contamination ratios. \nThese can be expressed on the basis of sediment \norganic carbon-organism lipid for hydrophobic \norganic chemicals. It is assumed that reduction \nin sediment contaminant concentrations over \ntime (e.g., as a result of remedial actions, waste- \nload allocations) will result in parallel reduction \nin exposure, aquatic organism residues, and, \nconsequently, the potential for toxic effects. It \nis further assumed that data on residue-to-toxici- \nty relationships can be obtained from laboratory \nexposures of organisms when such data are not \nalready available and that the route of exposure \nresponsible for residue accumulation does not \ninfluence the residue-toxicity relationships. \n7.2.1.2 Level of Eflort \nRelatively little effort would be required to \ngenerate preliminary sediment quality criteria \nusing MITCs calculated from existing water \nquality criteria and BCFs. In the absence of \nappropriate water quality criteria or BCFs, the \nlevel of effort depends on the availability of \ntissue residue action Ievels and the complexity \nof the sediment contaminant mitigation approach \nto be used. Relatively little effort is required to \ndetermine the degree to which sediment contam- \nination concentrations must be reduced for \nsingle chemicals in well-mixed systems where \nfish residues are uniformly unacceptable for \nhuman consumption. Much more effort is \nrequired for systems having sediment contamina- \ntion \u201chot spots\u201d where resident aquatic organ- \nisms are eliminated or reduced in number due to \na complex mixture of sediment contaminants. \nAnother complexity that could increase the \nrequired level of effort is the presence of sedi- \nment contaminants that are readily metabolized \n7-3 \nSediment Cluss;f;cation Methods Compendium \nto chemicals of greater toxicity that are responsi- \nble for the observed adverse effects. In some \ncases, residue-toxic effects data would incorpo- \nrate the effects of toxic metabolites. \n7.2.1.2.1 Type of Sampling Required \nSurface sediment samples must be analyzed \nfor chemical contamina& of interest. Inter- \nstitial water composition does not need to be \ndetermined because the residues in biota are \nrelated to bulk sediment chemical composition. \nSediment characteristics such as grain size, \norganic carbon content, and metal binding ca- \npacity are useful for defining sediment-to-biota \nrelationships for different sites witbin an ecosys- \ntem. Biota sampling for residue analysis should \ninclude sensitive organisms when toxic effects \nare a concern or, in the absence of sensitive \norganisms, organisms whose residues will serve \nas biomarkers for establishing safe sediment \ncontaminant levels. \n7.2.1.2.2 Methods \nThe tissue residue approach, as discussed in \nSection 7.2, depends on determining residues in \naquatic organisms that are unacceptable on the \nbasis of toxicity to the organism or unsuitability \nfor human or animal consumption as food. The \nlinkage of sediment contaminant concentrations \nto organism residues is possible through a num- \nber of approaches including site-specific \nmeasurements, equilibrium partitioning-based \npredictions, and steady-state food chain models. \nThe choice of a specific approach depends on \nthe chemical of concern, the availability of \nresidue-toxic effects data, the contamination \nhistory (in-place pollutant problem versus a \ncontinuing or projected sediment contamination \nproblem), and the characteristics of the impacted \necosystem. The construction of comprehensive, \nsystematic strategies for all potential sediment \ncontamination assessments will be achieved \nthrough further research and development. \nToxicity identification evaluation (TIE) \nprocedures (see Chapter 5) complement the \ntissue-residue approach. The TIE approach is especialiy useful if sediment assessment begins \nwithout knowledge of the sediment contaminants \nthat are causing toxicity or unacceptable residues \nin biota. The absence of bentbic species or \nfailure of fish eggs to hatch may be attributable \nto acutely toxic, but non-residue-forming, chemi- \ncals (e.g., ammonia) in sediments. TIE proce- \ndures can distinguish between potential metal, \nnonpolar organic, polar organic, and inorganic \nchemical sources of toxicity in sediment pore \nwaters or elutriates. These procedures enable a \nmore complete assessment of the significance of \nresidue-associated toxicity in the system. \nOnce potentially toxic, bioaccumulative \ncontaminants are identified, eitber in sediment or \nin aquatic organisms associated through expo- \nsure to sediments, the toxicological significance \nof site-specific sediment-to-biota contaminant \npartition factors can be assessed. Conservative \ngeneric sediment quality criteria can be generat- \ned from residue-toxicity relationships by assum- \ning equilibrium partitioning between the binding \nfractions of organisms and sediments (e.g., lipid \nand sediment organic carbon for nonpolar organ- \nic chemicals). \n7.2.1.2.3 Types of Data Required \nThe tissue residue method requires identifi- \ncation of chemicals in the sediment that are \nlikely to be associated with chronic environmen- \ntal effects. An indirect method for identifying \nsuch chemicals and their locations is to screen \naquatic organisms for residues as in the National \nDioxin Study (USEPA, 1987b) or the National \nStudy of Chemical Residues in Fish (USEPA, \n1992), sponsored by EPA\u2019s Office of Water \nRegulations and Standards. When toxicity data \nare not available, either laboratory dose-response \nexperiments or quantitative structure-activity \npredictions can be used to establish the toxico- \nlogical significance of the tissue residues. Field \nsurveys that indicate the absence of sensitive \norganisms in contaminated sediment areas are \nuseful for establishing sediment quality criteria, \nespecially if interspecies sensitivities to the \nchemicals of concern are known. Tissue resi- \ndues associated with no-effect and lowest- \n74 \n7-5s~~~ Residue Approwh \nobservable-effect concentrations are needed \nwhen the sediment criterion is not based on a \nhuman health standard. \n7.2.1.2.4 Necessary Hardware and Skills \nSediment and tissue analyses require com- \nmonly available chemical analytical capabilities. \nSome chemicals require advanced instrumental \nanalytical techniques, such as high resolution \ngas chromatography/mass spectrometry. \n7.2.1.3 Adequacy of Documentation \nThe use of tissue residues to establish sedi- \nment criteria on the basis of human health ef- \nfects associated with ingestion of contaminated \nfish has been documented. Methods for using \ntissue residue-toxicity relationships to establish \nsediment criteria, although scientifically sound, \nhave not been extensively documented. The \nvarious methods for predicting tissue residues in \nbenthos and fish have been well documented. \n7.2.2 Applicsbillty of Method to Human \nHealth, Aquatic Life, or Wildlife \nProtection \nTissue residue measurements are directly \napplicable to human risk assessment when the \naquatic organism is used as human food. Be- \ncause of this relationship, the tissue residue \nmethod provides a direct link between human \nhealth and sediment criteria development. Tis- \nsue residues for wildlife and aquatic organisms \ncan be used to assess sediment toxicity when \nthere is an established exposure linkage to the \nsediment. The tissue residue approach is most \nadvantageous for sediment contaminants that \nadversely impact organisms such as fish that are \nnot in direct contact with the sediment or its \ninterstitial water. The tissue residue approach is \nwell suited to evaluating sediment quality in \nsystems that have aquatic food chain connections \nfrom benthos to birds experiencing eggshell \nthinning or genotoxic effects. The tissue residue \nconcentration serves as a quantitative measure of \nsediment contaminant bioavailability, which may differ as a function of ecosystem, sediment, \nwater, food chain, and species characteristics. \n7.23 Ability of Method to Generate \nNumerical Criteria for Specizic \nChemicals \nThe tissue residue approach can be used to \ngenerate site-specific numerical criteria for non- \npolar organic chemicals such as PCDDs, PCDFq \nbd PCBs. Tissue residues of aMrin/dieldrin \n(USEPA, 1980a) and endrin (USEPA, 198Ob) \nhave been used to establish water quality criteria \non the basis of human health risks. The DDT and \nPCB water quality criteria are based on toxic \neffects in birds and animals as a function of fish \nresidues (USEPA, 198Oc, 198&l). Tissue residues \nof organometallic chemicals such as methyl \nmercury (USEPA, 1984) and elements such as \nselenium (USEPA, 1987a) have been used to \nestablish water quality criteria and/or to predict \ntoxic effects. There is some evidence to indicate \nthat metal residues in sedimentdwelling aquatic \norganisms can reflect both metal bioavailability \nand potential metal toxicity. Thus, tissue residue- \ntoxicity relationships for some elements could be \nused as an adjunct to the interstitial water equilib- \nrium partitioning approach. \n73 USEFULNESS \n73.1 Environmental Applicability \n7.3.X.1 Suitability for Difirent Sediment Types \nThere is no limitation to the suitability of this \napproach for different sediment types since the \nmethod is sensitive to bioavailability differences \namong sediments. When pelagic organisms are \nused to assess sediment quality, sediment variabi- \nlity in the water body tends to be averaged. \n7.3.1.2 Suitability for Difirent Chemicals or \nClasses of Chemicals \nThis approach is most applicable to nonpolar \norganics and organometallics that bioamulate, \nare slowly metabolized, and exert chronic toxic \n7-s \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \neffects or present risks to human health. This \napproach also could work well for chemicals that \nare metabolized by the organism to nontoxic \nforms since the parent compound residue reflects \nthis change in toxic potential. In some cases \nresidues of known metabolites, which are more \ntoxic than the parent compound, can be used to \nestablish restdue-toxic effects relationships (Krahn \net al., 1986). The approach is not useful for \nassessing sediment toxicity associated with non- \nresidue-forming toxic chemicals such as ammonia, \nhydrogen sulfide, and polyelectrolytes. Since \nthere is evidence that metal residues in some \nsediment-dwelling organisms are indicative of \nboth metal bioavailability and potential metal \ntoxicity, sediment quality criteria for metals \nshould be aided by a site-specific tissue residue \napproach. However, when biological species \nsequester metals in a nonbiologically available \nform, tissue residue-toxicity effects linkages may \nbe obscured. The suitability of the method for \nevaluating additive, synergistic, or antagonistic \neffects associated with complex mixtures of \nsediment contaminants depends on the develop- \nment of chemical mixture toxic dose-response \nrelationships where dose is indicated by tissue \nresidue levels. \n7.3.1.3 Suitability for Predicting Eflects on \nDifferen& Organisms \nThe tissue residue approach should not be \nlimited by species unless organism residues cannot \nbe obtained or toxic effects cannot be determined \nthrough water quality criteria or bioassays. The \nkey species problem is identification of sensitive \nspecies for the sediment contaminants of concern. \nWhen adequate comparative toxicity data exist, \nresidues from tolerant organisms may be used to \ninfer sediment criteria for sensitive organisms that \nare not found in association with the sediment \nbecause of toxic effects. \n7.3.1.4 Suitability for In-Place Pollutant Control \nEvaluation of the association of site-specific \ntissue residues with sediment toxic chemical \nconcentrations provides an established method for in-place pollutant assessment for both human \nhealth and ecological risks. Comparison of tissue \nresidues in field-collected organisms to the MPTC \nwould be a dired estimate of ecological risk. The \nuse of resident or caged biota for bioaccumuiation \npotential and toxicity assessments is useful for \ndetection of the most toxic sediments or monitor- \ning of changes in toxicity following remedial \nadion. By weighing the relative toxicity of \nbioaccumulated pollutants (e.g., by using \u201cdioxin \nequivalents\u201d), evaluation of tissue residue concen- \ntrations can help identify the pollutants most likely \nresponsible for toxicity and their additive contriiu- \ntion to total sediment toxicily. This information \ncould then be used to design the most appropriate \nand cost-effective mitigation response. \n7.3.1.5 Suitability for Source Control \nThe tissue residue approach is well suited for \nestablishing source control. Comparison of the \nexisting or predicted tissue residue levels with \nMPTCs generates a quantitative estimate of the \nextent to which a given sediment exceeds or is \nbelow a sediment quality criterion. In conjunction \nwith physical transport models, this information \ncan then be used directly to determine acceptable \ndischarge limits, wasteload allocations, or the \ntypes of remedial procedures required to achieve \nacceptable tissue residue levels. The Lake Ontario \nTCDD-Hyde Park Superfund case example de- \nscribed in Section 7.1.1 demonstrates the suitabili- \nty of this approach for establishing source con- \ntrols. The site-specific nature of this approach \nprovides strong support for establishing controls \non existing point and nonpoint sources of sedi- \nment contamination. \n7.3.X.6 Suitability for Disposal Applications \nWhen site-specific sediment-biota contaminant \npartition coefficients are unavailable, such as for \nevaluation of proposed disposal operations, the \nresidue approach can be applied by predicting \nbenthic tissue residues from steady-state toxiw- \nkinetic bioaccumulation models or by conducting \nlaboratory bioaccumulation tests on the dredged \nmaterial. If adverse effects on fishes, wildlife, or \n7-6 \n7-Tissue Residue Appraach \nhuman health are of concern at such disposal sites, \nit would then be necessary to apply a trophic \ntransfer or equilibrium partitioning model to \npredict tissue residues in these higher trophic \nlevels. When the disposal site already has sedi- \nments containing the contaminants of concern, \nresidues in existing biota may be used to predict \nresidue levels and toxic effects that would result \nfrom additional disposal of similarly contaminated \ndredged material. \n73.2 General Advantages aad Llmit~tlons \n7.3.2.1 Ease of Use \nThe application of sediment quality criteria \nderived from tissue residues for assessing pelagic \nor benthic ecological effects is fairly direct. The \nmeasured or predicted sediment concentration \nwould simply be compared to the sediment quality \ncriterion derived from MFTCs. The development \nof a tissue residue toxicity database from laborato- \nry bioassays would allow convenient am to the \nrequired biological effects endpoints. Chemical \nanalyses of sediment, total organic carbon, and \ntissue samples for assessing existing conditions \nrequire routine analytical chemistry capabilities \nthat do not present unique problems. One poten- \ntial difficulty when using tissue residues in field- \ncollected benthos to assess in-place sediments is \nthe difficulty in obtaining sufficient benthic \nbiomass for chemical analysis. This problem can \nbe avoided by conducting laboratory bioaccumula- \ntion tests on field-collected sediment or by placing \ncaged benthic organisms in the field. \n7.3.2.2 Relative Cost \nCosts associated with further development of \nthe generic tissue residue approach for sediment \nquality criteria include (1) development of a \nresidue-toxicity relationship database and (2) vali- \ndation of the relationships between the MFTC and \nchronic impacts on aquatic organisms for different \nchemical classes of sediment contaminants. The \ncost of applying the method to a particular site, \nhowever, depends on the number of sediment and \nbiota samples to be analyzed, the availability of residue-toxicity relationship data, and the difficul- \nty in identifying sensitive organisms. The estab- \nlishment of a sediment criterion based 011 fish \nresidue levels acceptable for protection of human \nhealth generally results in low analytical costs \nwhen only a few reference sediment sites are \nneeded to charaderize the system of concern. \n7.3.2.3 Tendency to Be Conmvalive \nThis approach does not tend to be either \nconservative or it&era1 for prediction of ecological \neffecis unless the system responds in a nonlinear \nmanner to reductions in sediment contaminants. \nTn the case of nonlinearity, the tendency would \nprobably be toward conservatism because of the \ngreater bioavailability of more recently introduced \nsediment contaminants. When human health \nendpoints are used to generate sediment quality \ncriteria, the criteria may be more strict than neces- \nsary to protect resident biota. \n7.3.2.4 Level of Acceptance \nThe tissue residue approach is accepted as a \nbasis for regulatory decisions such as the estab- \niishment of water quality criteria for the proteztion \nof aquatic life and its uses. The direct prediction \nof chronic toxic effects from measured or predict- \ned tissue residues requires validation before it can \nbe widely endorsed. Since sediment contaminants \ntend to be long-term exposure problems and can \nbioaccumulate, residues should be acceptable for \nsediment criteria development. This approach \nshould be acceptable for identifying sediments \nassociated with a degree of exposure which ex- \nceeds that indicated as deleterious in previous \nexperiments. \n7.3.2.5 Ability to Be Implemented by \nLuhrahes with l)pical Equipmnt \nand Handling Facilities \nThe tissue residue approach requires analyses \nof only sediment and tissue residues when poten- \ntially toxic sediment contaminants are known and \nresidue-toxicity relationship data are available. If \nextensive laboratory work is needed to determine \n7-7 \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \nchemical residue-chronic toxicity dose-response \nrelationships for sensitive species, specialized \naquatic toxicology capabilities are required. In \ntheory, residue-toxicity-based MF+T(S can be \nobtained for all chemicals subject to water quality \ncriteria development. \n7.3.2.6 Lmel of Efforr Repuired to Generate \nResults \nThe level of effort depends on the number and \nnature of sediment contaminants, the compiexity \nof the contaminant distribution pattern, and the \nregulatory application of the method. Some cases \nwill require relatively few analyses of tissue and \nsediment residues and no toxicity testing to apply \nthe method (e.g., to remedial action decisions, \nwasteload allocations). \n7.3.2.7 Degree to which Results Lend \nThemselves lo Inlerprerahn \nTissue residues that exceed concentrations \nconsidered safe for human exposure through \nseafood consumption require no interpretation \nwhen used to set residue-based sediment criteria. \nHowever, the degree of interpretation may be very \nlarge when evaluating ecotoxicological effects \nattributed to site-specific measurements of sedi- \nment-to-biota chemical partitioning. This interpre- \ntation problem exists for all sediment classification \nmethods when applied on a site-specific basis. \nThe presence of unacceptable residues in indicator \norganisms resident in or linked to an area of \nsediment contamination can be used without \nelaborate interpretation to determine compliance of \nsediments with sediment quality criteria. \n7.3.2.8 Degree of Environmen:al Applicability \nThe use of site-specific tissue residues as \nquantitative exposure biomarkers eliminates \nuncertainties associated with chemical bioavail- \nability; exposure duration, frequency, and magni- \ntude; and toxicokinetic/bioenergetic factors. When \nthe tissue residue approach is applied on a generic \nbasis to generate sediment criteria for different \nchemicals, these uncertainties can be partially addressed through classification of sediments and \nexposure environments. \n7.3.2.9 Degree of Accuracy and Precirion \nSediment and tissue residue chemical concen- \ntrations can be determined accurately and precise- \nly for most chemicals. Most uncertainties in \nsediment/organism partition coefficients are due to \nbiological variability. Accuracy and precision can \nbe maximized through site-specific investigations \nof biological factors that influence organism \nlinkage to sediment (through food chain, water, or \ndirect contact) and through refinement of residue- \ntoxicity relationships. \n7.4 STATUS \n7.4.1 Extent of Use \nUse of tissue residues to establish sediment \ncriteria on the basis of human health effects has \nbeen documented. Tissue residues have also been \nused to derive water quality criteria for the protec- \ntion of aquatic life and wildlife connected to the \naquatic food chain. Tissue residue-toxicity data \nthat may be used for d&riving numerical sediment \nquality criteria for some chemicals already exist in \nwater quality criteria documents, fish consumption \nadvisories, and the peer-reviewed literature. Much \naquatic toxicology work in progress or planned for \nthe future could produce the necessary data if \nresidue-based dose measurements are incorporated \ninto research plans. \n7.4.2 Extent to Which Approach Has Been \nField-Validated \nSediment TCDD contamination limits have \nbeen established for Lake Ontario on the basis of \nfish tissue residues. This use of tissue residue to \ngenerate sediment criteria has been validated \nthrough a steady-state model (Endicott el al., \n1989) and a laboratory bioaccumulation study \n(Cook et al., 1989) that demonstrated a linear \nrelationship at steady-state between sediment \ncontaminant concentration and bioaccumulated \n78 \n7-Tissue Residue Approach \nTCDD in lake trout, regardless of route of uptake. \nDeclines in DDT residues in fish and birds since \nits use was banned are associated with declining \nsurficial sediment concentrations in the Great \nLakes, the Southern California Bight, and else- \nwhere. Although other examples of studies \nvalidating the residue approach for single chemi- \ncals are available, its use for complex mixtures of \nchemicals in sediments to predict acceptable \ncontaminant concentrations with ecosystem protec- \ntion in mind has not been validated. \n7.43 Reasons for Limited Use \nUse of the tissue residue approach has been \nlimited for the following reasons: \nm This method is in a developmental stage \nand has not been formally adopted by \nEPA. \nm Aquatic toxicology has only recently pro- \ngressed to an understanding of residue- \nbased dose-response relationships for sedi- \nment contaminants. \nn Regulatory agencies, including EPA, have \nnot yet become committed to systematic \nestablishment and application of sediment \ncriteria methods. \nn The available and potentially available \nresidue-based toxicity data have not been \ncollated into a database for potential \nsediment criteria users. \n7.4.4 Outlook for Future Use and Amount \nof Development Yet Needed \nThis method can be implemented with a \nminima1 amount of effort in many cases, especial- \nly where a single chemical or toxicologically \nrelated family of chemicals is of concern. Guid- \nance documents should be written and reviewed. \nTissue residue criteria should be accumulated \nsystematically for a database. The use of this \nmethod in combination with other sediment \nclassification methods should be considered. Field validation of residue-based ecologicat effects \npredictions is essential. All sediment assessment \nmethods should be developed with concern for \nidentification of and application to those chemi- \ncals in the aquatic environment that are iong-term \nsediment contaminants having chronic toxicity \npotential. \n7.5 REFERENCES \nBatterman, A.R., P.M.

Lathrop \nCollege of DuPage, Division of Natural Sciences \n22nd at Lambert Road, Glen Ellyn, IL 60137 \nThe community, or assemblage, structure and \nfunction of benthic macroinvertebrates is used exten- \nsively to evaluate the quality of water resources and \ncharacterize causes and sources of impacts in lotic \n(flowing water) and lentic (standing water) freshwater \necosystems. (Marine benthic community structure is \ndiscussed in (Chapter 9.) Benthic macroinvertebrates \nare relatively sedentary organisms that inhabit or \ndepend on the sedimentary environment for their \nvarious life functions. Therefore, they are sensitive to \nboth long-term and short-term changes in habitat, \nsediment, and water quality. This chapter discusses \nassessment of benthic macroinvertebrates to determine \nsediment quality in conjunction with an integrated \napproach for assessing the quality of the water \nresources. This integrated approach uses sediment \nchemistry, sediment toxicity, habitat quality, and ben- \nthic macroinvertebrate community (assemblage) \nstructure and function to evaluate sediment quality, \nsimilar to the approaches now used to evaluate \nsurface water quality. The structural assessment \nrelates to the numeric taxonomic distribution of the \ncommunity, and the functional assessment involves \ntrophic level (feeding group) and morphological \nassessment. This chapter addresses the specific \nbenthic community assessment methods that are \navailable, or being developed, to complement the \nchemical and toxicological portions of the sediment \nquality assessment. \n8.1 SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS \n8.1.1 Current Use \nFreshwater benthic macroinvertebrate commu- \nnities are used in the following ways to assess the quality of the water resource (sediments, water, and \nhabitat): \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n8.1.1.2 Identification of the quality of ambient \nsites through a knowledge of the pollution \ntolerances and life history requirements of \nbenthic macroinvertebrates; \nEstablishment of criteria and standards \nbased on community performance at \nmultiple reference sites throughout an \necoregion or other regionalization categor- \nies; \nComparison of the quality of reference (or \nleast impacted) sites with test (ambient) \nsites; \nComparison of the quality of ambient \nsites with historical data to identify tem- \nporal trends; and \nDetermination of spatial gradients of con- \ntamination for source characterization. \nEcological Uses \nBenthic macroinvertebrate community (assem- \nblage) structure and function assessments have \nmany different applications. Site-specific knowl- \nedge of surface water quality, habitat quality, \nsediment chemistry, and sediment toxicity provide \nthe best context in which to interpret benthic \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \ncommunity assessment data. The objectives of \neach particular study should determine the types of \nrelated data necessary. Alone, benthic macroin- \nvertebrates can be used to screen for potential \nsediment contamination based on spatial gradients \nin community structure, but they should not be \nused alone to definitively determine sediment \nquality. Benthic macroinvertebrate data must be \nintegrated with other available data to determine \nsediment quality. Benthic macroinvertebrate often \nprovide the most important piece of information on \nsediment quality. Care must be exercised to \ncollect representative samples to minimize prob- \nlems with data interpretation due to natural varia- \ntions. For example, collections should not be \nmade after floods or other physical disturbances \nthat may physically alter or remove benthic assem- \nblages. \nBenthic macroinvertebrate community structure \nand function have been used extensively to charac- \nterize freshwater ambient conditions and impacts \nfrom various sources. Documented changes in \nbenthic community structure have resulted from \ncrude oil exposure in ponds and streams (Rosen- \nberg and Wiens, 1976; Mozley, 1978; Mozley and \nButler, 1978; Cushman, 1984; Cushman and Goy- \nert, 1984) and heavy metal contamination of lake \nsediments and streams (Winner et al., 1975,1980, \nWentsel et al., 1977; Moore et al., 1979; Wieder- \nholm, 1984a, 1984b; Waterhouse and Farrell, \n1985). Benthic macroinvertebrates have been used \nextensively to identify organic enrichment in lentic \nsystems (Cook and Johnson, 1974: Krieger, 1984; \nRosas et al., 1985) and lotic systems (Richardson, \n1928; Gaufin and Tarzwell, 1952; Hynes, 1970; \nHilsenhoff, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1988). Benthic \ncommunity responses to pesticides (van Dyk et al., \n1975; Webb, 1980; Penrose and Lenat, 1982; \nYasuno et al., 1985), acid- and mine-stressed lotic \nenvironments (Simpson, 1983; Armitage and \nBlackburn, 1985), thermally stressed water bodies \n(Crossman et al., 1984), and urban and highway \nrunoff impacts (Smith and Kaster, 1983; Dupuis et \nal., 1985; Denbow and Davis, 1986) have also \nbeen documented. Chironomidae (midge) larvae \nwere even found to transport substantial amounts \nof PCBs from contaminated sediments to the \nterrestrial environment (Larsson, 1984). 8.1.1.2 Regulatory Uses \nAssessment of benthic macroinvertebrate com- \nmunity (assemblage) structure and/or function has \nbeen used as a regulatory tool for a number of \nyears (Davis, 1990). In 1987, USEPA hosted the \nFirst National Workshop on Biological Monitoring \nand Criteria (USEPA, 1988a, 1988b), which ad- \ndressed the use of benthic macroinvertebrates, as \nwell as fish, in EPA and State regulatory pro- \ngrams. This workshop formally initiated EPA\u2019s \nefforts toward development and implementation of \n\u201cbiological criteria\u201d based on benthic macroin- \nvertebrate, fish, and habitat assessments. These \nbiological criteria, which have been predominantly \nbased on the macroinvertebrates, are designed to \ndetermine whether a specific water body or water \nbody segment is meeting its designated use for \naquatic life (i.e., water quality standards). \nEPA requires the development of biological \ncriteria and adoption by States into their water \nquality standards by September 30,1993 (USEPA, \n1991a, 1990b). This requirement has been sup- \nported by a formal policy (USEPA, 1990c), pro- \ngram guidance (USEPA, 1992a), and technical \nguidance and support documents (USEPA, 1991a, \n1991b, 1991c, 1991d, 1991e, 1992b, 1992c). \nSeveral States currently use benthic macroin- \nvertebrates as a regulatory tool, either alone or in \ncombination with other ecological parameters \n(Ohio EPA, 1990, USEPA, 1991c, 1991e). \nUSEPA also supports the use of benthic macroin- \nvertebrates as a primary environmental indicator \nfor surface. waters that EPA should use to track \ncompliance with Clean Water Act objectives (Abe \net al., 1992; USEPA, 1990d, 1990e). \nUnder the Clean Water Act, as amended in \n1987, benthic macroinvertebrates are used for the \nfollowing: \n\u2022 Measurement of the restoration and main- \ntenance of biological integrity in surface \nwaters (section 101); \n\u2022 Development of water quality criteria based \non biological assessment methods when nu- \nmerical criteria for toxicity have not been \nestablished [section 303(c)(2)(B)]; \n8-2 PFreshwatcr Benthic Macroinvert&afe Community Sftudure and Fun&h \nm Production of guidance and criteria based \non biological monitoring and assessment \nmethods [section 304(a)(8)]; \nn Development of improved measures of the \neffects of pollutants on biological integrity \n(section 105); \nn Production of guidelines for evaluating \nnonpoint sources (NPS) [seciion 304(f)]; \nn Listing of waters that cannot attain desig- \nnated uses without additional NPS \ncontrols (section 319); \nn Listing of waters unable to support bal- \nanced aquatic communities [section \n304(l)]; \nm Assessment of lake trophic states and \ntrends (section 314); \nn Production of biennial reports on the \nextent to which waters support balanced \naquatic communities [section 305(b)]; \nad, \nn Determination of the effect of dredge and \nfill disposal on balanced wetland \ncommunities (section 404). \nBenthic macroinvertebrates and biological \ncriteria have also been used to evaluate on-site \nand off-site ecological impacts from hazardous \nwaste sites. Environmental assessment of a \nSuperfund site is done in accordance with EPA\u2019s \nresponsibility to protect public health and the \nenvironment under the Comprehensive Environ- \nmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Ad \nof 1980 (CERCM) as amended by the Superfund \nAmendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 \n(SARA). The regulation that enables EPA to carry \nout its responsibilities under CERCLA/SA.&% is \nthe National Contingency Plan (NCP). \nThe NCP calls for the identification and \nmitigation of environmental impacts of these sites \nand the selection of remedial actions that are \n\u201cprotective of environmental organisms and ecosystems.\u201d Federal and state laws and rcgda- \ntions that aid in this process are potentially \u201cappli- \ncable or relevant and appropriate requirements\u201d \n(ARARs). Compliance with these laws and \nregulations increasingly requires that the site\u2019s \necological effeds be evaluated and measures be \ntaken to mitigate those adverse cffeds. \nThe Clean Water Ad, as amended by the \n1987 Water Quality Ad, is another ARAR and \nmajor federal regulation that requires the main- \ntenance and restoration of the chemical, physical, \nand biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters. \nMost Superfund sites potentially affect surface \nwaters and need to be assessed for both on-site \nand off-site effects. A detailed discussion of the \nlegal and technical requirements for environmental \nassessments at Superfund sites can be found in \nEPA\u2019s Risk Assessment Guidance for Super \nEnvironmental Evaluation Manual (USEPA, \n1989a). As EPA focuses on watershed and water \nbody impacts regardless of the programmatic \nsources and causes, the use of benthic macroin- \nvertebrates for assessing the health of surface \nwater systems will increasingly become important. \n8.1.2 Potential Use \nThe use of benthic macroinvertebrates to assess \nsediment contamination will be most successful \nwhen combined with sediment chemistry and \ntoxicity results, as in the \u201cintegrated\u201d Sediment \nQuality Triad approach (see Chapter 10). Benthic \nmacroinvertebrates will best indicate in-place \npollutant control needs through a site-specific \nknowledge of surface water quality, habitat quality, \nand sediment chemistry and toxicity. Habitat \nquality assessments will help establish reasonable \nexpectations for benthic community structure and \nfunction. Alone, benthic macroinvertebrates can be \nused to screen for potehtial sediment contamination \nand source identification by displaying spatial \ngradients in community structure, but they should \nnot be used alane to deftitively determine sedi- \nment quality or to develop chemical-specific guide- \nlines. Benthic macroinvertebrate data must be \nintegrated with other available data to determine \nsediment quality as well as the quality of the \noverall water resource. \n8-3 Sediment Classfjcratitm Methods Compendium \n8.2 DESCRIPTION \n8.2.1 Description of Method \nThe benthic macroinvertebrate community \nstructure and function assessment involves the \nfollowing steps: \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n(4 \n5) \n(6) \n(7) Establishment of data quality objectives, \nselection of sample sites and frequency of \ncollection in Quality Assurance Program \nPlan; \nCollection of benthic macroinvertebrates in \nthe field (artificial or natural substrates); \nSorting the organisms from debris (field or \nlaboratory); \nIdentification to the lowest taxon necessary \n(varies depending on the study objectives); \nMultimetric or composite index quantifica- \ntion (e.g., taxa richness, number of individ- \nuals, indicator organism count, structural \nindexes and ratios, functional character- \nistics of taxa); \nAssessmenl of the relationship with other \nenvironmental measurements including \nnumeric habitat quality assessment (e.g., \ncorrelations, habitat requirements) and \nexpectations; \nComparison with a local or regional \u201crefer- \nence\u201d site (e.g., similarity indexes, non- \nparametric analyses); and \n(8) Complete documentation of the study \nmethods, results, database management, \nand discussion of the relevance of the data. \n8.2.1.1 Objectives and Assumptions \nlbe primary objective of benthic macroinverte- \nbrate community (assemblage) structure and func- \ntion analyses is to provide data and information to \nassist in determining the quality of the sedi- ment/water environment. This determination can \nthen be used for the purposes descriied above in \nSection 8.1 (Specific Applications). \nIt is assumed that benthic macroinvertebrates \ncan provide consistent and accurate assessments of \nsedimenlkater quality at a given sample location or \nwater body. Specifically, the following assump \ntions are implicit in this objective: \nm \nn \nm \nm \nn The benthic macroinvertebrates are rela- \ntively sedentary, especially compared to \nfEh communities, and they depend on the \nsedimentary (or benthic) environment for \ntheir life functions. \nChemical and physical perturbations of the \nsediments or bottom waters affect benthic \nmacroinvertebrates since they are depen- \ndent on the benthic environment for com- \npletion of their life cycles, and they are \ntherefore sensitive to changes in sediment \nand water quality. \nBcnthic macroinvertebrates physically \ninteract with the sediments to cause c&em- \nical exchange between the sediment and \nthe overlying water, and therefore tend to \nreflect sediment quality as well as water \nquality. \nMinimum habitat quality exists below \nwhich the community structure and func- \ntion will perform poorly regardless of the \nchemical contaminants present or not \npresent. \nThe optimal use of benthic macroinverte- \nbrates as sediment quality indicators is as \npart of an integrated sediment quality as- \nsessment approach using sediment \nchemistry, sediment toxicity, and benthic \ncommunity structure and function. \nEqually important assumptions apply to actual \nbenthic macroinvertebrate sampling strategy, a&c- \ntion, identification, data reduction, interpretation of \nresults, and report preparation. It is assumed that \nall U.S. EPA-supported studies have an adequate \n8-4 \n8-Freshwater Benthic Macroi.nvert&rate Community Structure and Function \nQuality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and that all \nbenthic macroinvertebrate community data are \nreproducrble and collected in a manner to minimize \ndata interpretation problems with natural variations; \nthe methods Ipust be consistent within each study. \nSpecific QA procedures that should be established \nearly in benthic macroinvertebrate community \nstudies include the following: \nRationale for sample location selection; \nSample collection methods, sorting, and \nstorage procedures; \nTaxonomic proficiency evaluations using \neither U.S. EPA check-samples from Cin- \ncinnati-ERL or state-developed check- \nsamples, in addition to voucher collec- \ntions from each study ares and a list of \nthe taxonomic references used, \nMultimetric data analysis techniques used \nto objectively assess the data, including \nthe structural and functional measures; \nand \nNonparametric or parametric (as appropri- \nate) statistical methods used to compare \nsite results. \nEach Regional U.S. EPA Quality Assurance \nOffice can provide the details of QAPP require- \nments. Further discussion of quality assurance \nmeasures can be found in Klemm et al. (1990), \nBode (1988) Ohio EPA (1989b), and Stribling \n(1991). \n8.2.1.2 Level of Eflort \nThe level of effort required lo conduct fresh- \nwater benthic macroinvertebrate community \nstudies is comparable with chemical/physical \nwater quality measurements and bioassays and has \nbeen thoroughly discussed in Plafkin et al. (1989) \nand Ohio EPA (1990a). However, rapid benthic \ncommunity assessment techniques can range from \n1 to 5 hours per site if laboratory identifications \nare not required (Plafkin et al., 1989). As expect- ed, the greatest time expenditure is in the travel to \nand from the site and in the sorting and identifica- \ntion of the organisms. \nSeparating the organisms from debris and \nsorting the organisms into taxonomic categories \ncan take up to 15 hours per sample, with an \nadditional 12 hours for identification, for very \nenriched sites with high numbers of individuals \namong several taxa. In such extreme situations, \nsubsampling may be preferred. More typically, \nthe time spent would be about 3 hours for sorting \n(more time for dredge and artificial substrate \nsamples and less time for dip-net samples), \n2 hours for preparing the samples (e.g., clearing \nand then mounting the chironomids on microscope \nslides), and 6 hours for identifying the organisms \nto the lowest possible taxonomic level. An exper- \nienced taxonomist with appropriate keys may \naverage only 2-4 hours per site. This typical time \nequates to about 11 hours per site after the sam- \nples have been collected. These estimates are \nonly a general guide to the time it may take to \nperform the identifications and are meant to help \nassess potential or actual project costs. \n8.2.1.2.1 Type of Sampling Required \nThe specific sampling methods to be used are \ndictated by the study needs. Debate will continue \nregarding the use of \u201cquantitative\u201d and \u201cqualita- \ntive\u201d sampling methods, but each method is \nacceptable contingent upon bow well it will satisfy \nstudy objectives, reproducibility of the data, and \nconsistency of collection. Typically, benthic \nmacroinvertebrate data are quantified by the \nsurface area of the sampler or sediment being \ncollected. However, benthic macroinvertebrates \ncan be quantified in other ways depending on the \nobjectives of the study. For example, if the \nobjective is to determine the number and types of \ntaxa in a study area, rather than the number of \nindividuals within each taxon, then using a dip-net \nin various habitats within the study area until no \nnew taxa are encountered could be considered \nquantitative with relation to the number of taxa \nand time expended. Examples of programs using \ndata quantified by methods other than surface area \nof the sampler or substrate include those described \n8-5 \nS&nent Cluss~icntM1 Methods Compendium \nby Pollard (1981), Hilsenhoff (1982, 1987,1988), \nCummins and Wilzbach (1985), Bode and Novak \n(1988), Cummins (1988), Hite (1988), Lenat \n(1988), Maret (19881, Penrose and Qverton \n(1988), Plafkin et al. (1989), and Sbakelford \n(1988). The success of each sampling effort \ndepends on a thorough understanding of the data \nquality objectives of that study and the implemen- \ntation of a quality assurance program. \n8.2.1.2.2 Methods \nEPA (Klemm et al., 1990) recently published \nMacroinvertebrate Field and Laboratory Methocis \nfor Evaluating the Biological Integrity of Swface \nWaters, which thoroughly addresses methodology. \nMost state environmental regulatory programs \nhave a Quality Assurance Project Plan describing \nthe field methods and standard operating proce- \ndures for collecting and evaluating benthic maao- \ninvertebrates (Bode, 1988; Illinois EPA, 1987; \nOhio EPA, 1989a, 1989b). This information \nshould be obtained to ensure acceptance and \ncomparability of study results with those obtained \nby the state agency. If this information is not \navailable, then field methods and standard operat- \ning procedures from other existing programs \nshould be used. Since several different collection \nand analysis methods are used throughout the \ncountry depending on water body type (lotic vs. \nlentic), habitat type, substrate type, and familiarity \nwitb specific methods, it is not practical to recom- \nmend any single sampling method. The general \nquality assurance requirements the use of any one \nparticular method is that the method produce data \nthat are reproducible, consistently used within the \nprogram, and applicable by different investigators \n(Klemm et al., 1990). \nMethods Summary-h soft freshwater sediments \nthe most common method used to collect benthos \nis with a grab sampler such as a Ponar (15 x 15 \ncm or 23 x 23 cm) or Ekman dredge (15 x 15 cm, \n23 x 23 .an, or 30 x 30 cm), each of which \nprovides a quantitative sample based on the \nsurface area of the sampler. The smaller of the \nsurface area sizes are most commonly used for freshwater studies because of their relative ease of \nmanipulation. Ihe Ekman dredge is not as effec- \ntive in areas of vegetative debris, but is much \nlighter than the Ponar and easier to use in softer \nsubstrates. Artificial substrates (Hester-Bendy \nusing several 3-inch plates and spacers attached by \nan eyebolt; or substrate/rock-filled baskets) pro- \nvide a consistent habitat for the benthos to colo- \nnize in both soft-bottomed and stony areas. \nArtificial substrates can be used in almost any \nwater body and have been successfully used to \nstandardize results despite habital differences \n(APHA et al., 1989; DePauw, 1986; Hester and \nDendy, 1962; Ohio EPA, 1989b; Rosenberg and \nResh, 1982, 1991), but the major drawback to \nusing the artificial substrates is the 4- to 8-week \nperiod for instream colonization. This would \nrequire at least two visits for each study site-one \nto place the samplers and one to remove them. \nA variety of methods for sampling hard- \nbottomed lotic systems are available. Colonization \nof substrates and comparisons of the artiticial and \nnatural substrate methods have been described \n(Beckett and Miller, 1982; Chadwick and Canton, \n1983; Crossman and Cairns, 1974; Lenat, 1988; \nOhio EPA, 1989b; Peckarsky, 1986; Plafkin et al., \n1989; Shepard, 1982). If quantification by sedi- \nment or sampler surface area is needed, a Surber- \ntype square-foot sampler (Surber, 1937, 1970) \nwith a #30-mesh (0589-mm openings) can be \nused. The traveling kick-net (or dip-net) method, \nalso using a #30-mesh net, can be used to quantify \nthe sample collected by the amount of time spent \nsampling and the approximate surface ares sam- \npled (Pollard, 1981; Pollard and Kinney, 1979). \nThe Surber-type and kick-net methods can each be \nused to provide consistent, reproducible samples, \nbut both are limited to wadable streams. The \nSurber sampler\u2019s optimal effectiveness is limited \nto riffIes, whereas kick- or dip-net sampling can \nbe used in all available habitats. Although dip-net \nsamplers have been effectively used to sample \nriffles and other relatively shallow habitats to \ndetermine taxa richness, presence of indicator \norganisms, relative abundances, similarity between \nsites, and other information, they do not provide \ndefinitive estimates of the number of individuals \nor biomass per surface area. \n8-6 \n8-Fmshwater Benthic Macroin&&rate Community Sfructure and Funcfion \nFor sediment evaluations of lotic systems, a \ncombination of artificial substrate (e.g., Hester- \nDendy) and natural substrate (dip-net) sampling is \nrecommended. \u2018TEis combination allows compari- \nson of the benthos communities independent of \nhabitat so that sediment/water quality effects can \nbe better assessed. \nSlmpling Strategy--Sampling strategies have \nbeen addressed by KIemm et al. (1990), Millard \nand Lettenmaier (1986), Plafkin et al. (1989), \nRosenberg and Resh (1991), Sheldon (1984), and \nUSEPA 199Ob, 199Oc). Special monitoring strate- \ngies have been prepared for EPA\u2019s Environmental \nMonitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP), \nwhich employs a probabilistic sample design \n(USEPA, 1991f); the intensive watershed surveys \nof the U.S. Geological Survey (Leahy et al., \n1990); and forestry activities in the Pacific North- \nwest (USEPA, 1991g). Regardless of the study \nobjectives for regulatory use, reference (least- \nimpacted) sites will be required for comparison \nwith the results from test (ambient) sites. Refer- \nence sites can be established on a site-specific or \nregional basis. It is preferable to use a regional- \nization approach because the level of confidence \nin the results is greater using an increased number \nof reference sites, which allows for a verification \nthat the sites truly are least-impacted reference \nsites. Regionalization (ecoregions, watersheds) \nhas been successfully used in a number of State \nprograms to support biological criteria deveiop- \nment for benthic macroinvertebrates (Gallant et \nal., 1989, Ohio EPA, 1990, Arkansas DPCE, \n1987, Hughs et al., 1990, USEPA, 1991c, 1991e). \nWhen using site-specific reference sites to \ndetect spatial differences in sediment/water quali- \nty, or to characterize sources of pollution, the best \nstrategy is to collect samples in similar habitats \nupstream and downstream of suspec!ed pollution \nsources or other areas of interest for ambient \nmonitoring such as high-quality or wild and scenic \nstreams (USEPA, 1992b). A minimum of two \nupstream sites and three downstream sites of the \nsuspected pollutant source(s) should be sampled, \nhowever, many programs are limited to only one \nupstream site and one or two downstream sites. If \nhabitats vary too widely, then artificial substrates should be placed at each site, with multihabitat \ndip-net sampling done when the substrates are \nplaced instream and retrieved, to complement the \nartificial substrate data. \nTo best detect temporal trends, a fued station \nnetwork should be established near the area of \ninterest and sampled consistently at least one \nseason each year. A reference location should \nalso be sampled at the same times to ensure that \ndifferences found in the results can be attributed \nto changes in water quality near the site. It is \nstrongly recommended that a set of reference sites \nbe developed withirl each ecoregion (or by other \nregional&&ion methods) and that those reference \nsites be sampled seasonally to better understand \nsite-specific seasonal variability. Sampling should \nbe done each year during similar flow conditions \nand should not be conducted for at least 1 or 2 \nweeks after a major rainfall because of the poten- \ntial for physical disturbances of the substrate \nresulting in potentially lower biological integrity \nratings. \nSeasonal distributions are always a conceru \nfor ensuring the collection of a representative \nsample. Therefore, routine sampling or monitor- \ning is optimal during the seasons indicated in \nPlatlcin et al. (1988), and long-term monitoring \nshould strive for consistent sampling seasons. The \nbenthic macroinvertebrate discussion group at the \n1987 National Workshop on Instream Biological \nMonitoring and Criteria agreed that the biological- \nly optimal time of year for sampling in iotic \nsystems was during the latter part of the season(s) \nthat demonstrate a stable base-flow (normal flow) \nand temperature regime (Davis and Simon 1988). \nSample R~plicatio~ample replication is a \ncomponent of a good Quality Assurance Program \nPlan. Recommendations and discussion regarding \nsample replication can be found in Plafkin et al. \n(1989), Klemm et al. (1990), and USEPA (1992b). \nStatistical derivation of the number of samples \nrequired to decrease the variability of the data \nhave been discussed by Green (19781, Merritt et \nal. (1984), Resh and Price (1984), and Klemm et \nal. (1990). These methods generally rely on a \nprior knowledge of the variability of the data. \nThis prior knowledge is often not available nor \n8-7 \nSediment CZass$cation Methods Compendium \npractical to obtain from a programmatic view \n(e.g., the cost of initial sampling to estimate \nvariability and required number of replicates may \nbe prohibitive). Another problem with statistically \ndetermining the number of samples needed is the \nassumption that the data follow a specific distribu- \ntion such as normal or lognormal, which is not \nnecessarily true for biological samples. Also, the \nvariability, as measured by the variance or \nstandard deviation, could be different for each \ndescriptive index analyzed (number of taxa versus \nnumber of individuals, etc.). \nField Methods-Field sampling methods have \nbeen adequately addressed by many manuals, \nincluding the new USEPA macroinvertebrate field \nand laboratory manual (Klemm et al., 1990), the \nASTM methods for sampling benthos (ASTM, \n1988), Ohio EPA\u2019s Field Methods Manual (Ohio \nEPA, 1989b), Standard Methods (APHA et al., \n1989), USEPA\u2019s Rapid Bioassessment Protocols \n(Plafkin et al., 1989), and USEPA\u2019s Superfund \nField Compendium (USEPA, 1987). The follow- \ning decisions will need to be made once the \nsample gear is chosen: \nm Whether samples will be picked from \ndebris and sorted in the field, \nn Which preservative should be used; \nn Whether a stain (rose bengal) will be \nadded to the sample to facilitate separat- \ning the organisms from debris; \nl Whether the samples need to be shipped \nand whether they require a chain-of-cus- \ntody form (as in Superfund samples); and \n8 The type of sample containers and label- \ning of tbe containers required. \nSorting--There are many discussions elsewhere \nof techniques for sample sorting and preparation \nof slides for identification. Klemm et al. (1990), \nMerritt el al. (1984), Pennack (1978) and APHA \nef al. (1989) offer excellent guidance for sample \nsorting. Hynes (1970, 1971) stated that the earlier stages of benthos are retained by a 0.2-mm \nmesh size (approximately the size of a W75 stan- \ndard sieve), and APHA et of. (1989) and Klemm \net 01. (1990) defined the benthos by a mesh size \nof 0.595 (standard sieve #30), which is now \nstandard practice. However, some types of chiro- \nnomidae and other small benthos pass through the \n#30-mesh sieve but are be retained by the #40- \nmesh sieve. It is therefore recommended that \nsamples be passed through a #30-mesh sieve and \nthat the materials washed through be passed \nthrough a &to-mesh sieve; the material retained in \nboth sieves should ihen be sorted (Ohio EPA, \n1989b). Once the material is washed through the \nsieves the organisms should be separated from the \nvegetation and other debris in a white enamel pan. \nAs the materials are separated, the organisms can \nbe placed in different vials for the major taxa. \nTaxonomy--The level to which the taxonomy \nshould be taken is dependent on the objectives of \nthe study. For a system reconnaissance or screen- \ning survey, it is generally not necessary to go \nbeyond the family level (Hilsenhoff, 1988; Illinois \nEPA, 1987; Plafkin et of., 198% Resh, 1988). For \nstudies attempting to identify designated use \nimpairment and/or evaluate impacts from a speci- \nfic source., the recommended minimum level of \ntaxonomic detail should follow the list by Ohio \nEPA (1989b). Ohio EPA has successfully imple- \nmented numeric biocriteria based on this taxonom- \nic detailing. \u2018Ihis strategy is to expend the effort \nto differentiate those taxa which are better water \nresource quality indicators and for which taxo- \nnomic keys and expertise are readily available. \nThe level of taxonomic detaifing must be consis- \ntent within the program and applied for each study \nsite. Species-level identifications for all organisms \nare not necessary for a successful program, and \nthey commonly depend on the availability of local \nkeys. General keys available for genus-level \nidentifications include Merritt and Cummins \n(1984) for insects, Peckarsky et al. (1990) for \ninsects and other invertebrates, Pennack (1978, \n1989) for all common invertebrates, Wiederholm \n(1983) for midges, and Klemm (1985) for annelids \n(oligochaetes and leeches). Klemm et al. (1990) \nprovide an excellent list of taxonomic references \n&-Freshwater Benfhic Macroinvertebrate Community Strudure and Function \nfor other general and specific uses. Regional U.S. \nEPA or state biologists should be contacted to \ndetermine which of the hundreds of other taxo- \nnomic keys are available for specific taxa, both \nnationally and regionally. \n8.2.1.2.3 Types of Data Required \nThe types of data analyses that are required to \nmeet program objectives directly affect the types \nof data required. A list of the families of taxa \npresent may be sufficient to meet some program \nobjectives. Under other circumstances, species- \nlevel taxonomy and enumerations may be re- \nquired. The necessary data required to conduct \ndifferent types of analyses can be obtained from \nthe following discussion of data analysis methods. \nOne of the most inconsistent and perplexing \naspects of a freshwater benthic macroinvertebrate \ncommunity assessment is the numeric representa- \ntion and analysis of the data collected. Structural \ncommunity measures such as richness values, \ndiversity and biotic indexes, and enumerations \nhave been used almost exclusively. Indicator \norganisms have been used to establish many of the \nbiotic indexes but also have the potential to \ndifferentiate among types of impacts. Recently, \nfunctional community measures based on feeding \ngroups such as shredder, collector, scraper, and \npredator (Cummins and Merritt, 1984) have \ngained wider application and acceptance due to \ntheir sensitivity in detecting system perturbation \non food resources. Sediment and water quality \nassessments based on the benthic macroinverte- \nbrate community should use a complementary mix \nof both structural and functional measures. It is \nstrongly recommended that a multimetric lech- \nnique be used (Plafkin et al., 1989; Ohio EPA, \n1990a) so any single index value or observation \nwill not substantially influence the results. Dis- \ncussions of various data analysis techniques can \nbe found in Hawkes (1979), Cairns (1981), \nKlemm et al. (1990), Washington (1984), and \nResh and Jackson (1990). \nComposite Iodexes&mposite or multimetric \nindexes combine selected structural or functional \nmeasures, or \u201cmetrics,\u201d in a cumulative scoring system, as was done with the Index of Biotic \nIntegrity (IBI) for the fish community (Karr et al., \n1986). These composite, or multimetric, indexes \nare highly recommended and are among the most \nused assessment techniques for development of \nbiological criteria for both benthic macroinverte- \nbrates and fish. \nKarr and Kerans (1992) provide an outstand- \ning discussion of the process of developing met- \nrics proposed for use in an invertebrate IBI. They \nevaluated 28 potential metrics for inclusion and \nhave eliminated 10 from further consideration. \nThe metrics fail into three categories: taxa rich- \nness and community composition, trophic and \nfunctional feeding group, and abundance. \nOhio EPA (1989b, 1990a) successfully devei- \noped a similar index for invertebrates using the \nfollowing 10 structural metrics, adjusted for \ndrainage area size with each ecoregion, to derive \na final Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) score: \n(1) Total number of taxa; \n(2) Total number of mayfly taxa; \n(3) Total number of caddisfly taxa; \n(4) Total number of dipteran taxa; \n(5) Percent mayflies; \n(6) Percent caddisflies; \n(7) Percent Tribe Tanytarsini midges; \n(8) Percent other dipterans and non-insects; \n(9) Percent tolerant organisms; and \n(10) Total number of qualitative EPT taxa. \nThe ICI score is part of Ohio EPA\u2019s numeric \nbiocriteria for designated use attainment, and it \nwas developed using artificial and natural sub- \nstrate data for 232 \u201cleast-impacted\u201d reference sites. \nA statistical validation of the ICI using a factor \nanalysis technique showed high correlations \nbetween the factor analysis scores and the ICI \n8-9 \nSe&rent ClassijiiXltion Methods Compendium \nscores and little redundancy between the metrics \n(Davis and Lubin, 1989). \nU.S. EPA (Plafkin er al., 1989) developed a \ncomposite in&x for rapid assessments in lotic \nsystems using the following two functional and six \nstructural metrics: \n(1) Taxa richness; \n(2) Modified Hilsenhoff biotic index; \n(3) Ratio of scrapers and filtering collectors \n(functional); \n(4) Ratio of EPT and Chironomidae abun- \ndances; \n(5) Percent contribution of dominant taxon; \n(6) EPT index; \n(7) Community similarity index; and \n(8) Ratio of shredders to total number of \norganisms (functional). \nThese Rapid Bioassessment Protocols (RBPs) \nrecommend conducting single-habitat (riffle) dip- \nnet sampling. The scores are based on a percent- \nage of the metric values found at a reference site, \nrather than comparison of the results based on \n\u201coptimal\u201d values for each metric. Modifications to \nthe RBPs can include use of multiple reference \nsites. The RBPs are flexible and can be modified \nfor different geographical locations, as evidenced \nby the use of different metrics in Arkansas (Shak- \nelford, 1988) and New York (Bode and Novak, \n1988). The success of the RBPs is in the use of \nthe composite index for rapid assessments that \nallows for three levels of taxonomic work (i.e., \norder, family, or genus/species levels). Order and \nfamily taxonomy do not require laboratory taxono- \nmy and may be done in the field. The RBPs \nnormally use single-habitat (riffle) sampling and a \nlOO-organism count in the field. However, they \ncan be adapted for most program uses; for exam- \nple, by employing multihabitat sampling and/or \nvarious count limitations. To be applicable to a state\u2019s program, the RBPs should undergo a \nrigorous validation effort within that state. \nDiver&y Indexes-When diversity indexes were \nintroduced, they were used widely because of their \nability to reduce the complex benthic community \nmeasurements into a single value that could be \nused by nonbiologist decision-makers. Diversity \nindexes are based on measuring the distribution of \nthe number of individuals among the different \ntaxa, and use methods that result in enumerations \nby surface area. The most common diversity \nindex used for water quality studies is the Shan- \nnon, or Shannon-Wiener fndex (Shannon and \nWeaver, 1949) as shown below: \nwhere: \nni = Total number of individuals in the \ni* taxon \nn= Total number of individuals \ns = Total number of taxa. \n(Washington (1984) provides a good explanation \nof how the index derived the name Shannon- \nWiener Index rather than Shannon-Weaver Index.) \ntheoretically, higher community diversity indi- \ncates better water quality (Wilhm, 1970). How- \never, low diversity may be caused by factors other \nthan water quality impacts, such as extremes in \nweather (floods or droughts), poor habitat, or \nseasonal fluctuations. Although diversity indexes \nsuch as the Shannon-Wiener Index still remain in \nwidespread use (Washington, 1984), their limita- \ntions in accurately addressing a variety of pertur- \nbations has decreased their reliability (Cooke, \n1976; Hilsenhoff, 1977; Hughs, 1978; Chadwick \nand Canton, 1984; Washington, 1984; Mason et \nal., 1985; Resh, 1988). Kaesler er al., (1978) \ndemonstrated that the popular Shannon\u2019s Index \nwas actuaIly not the preferred index for aquatic \necology studies and recommended the use of \nBrillouin\u2019s (1962) Index. Resh (1988) reported \nthat diversity indexes showed varied results in de- \n8-10 \n8-Freshwtater Benthi: M~t~~invertcbratc Community Structure and Function \nteding changes in water quality and that they are \nnot the optimal measures of water quality. How- \never, diversity indexes can provide additional \ninformation as to the community composition and \nshould be reported if the data are available. Reli- \nance on these indexes as the only, or predominant, \nmeasure on which water pollution control deci- \nsions are based is not valid. Washington (1984) \nprovides an outstanding review of the history and \nuses of diversity indexes. \nBiotic Indexes-Biotic indexes use pollution \ntolerance scores for each taxon, weighted by the \nnumber of individuals assigned to each tolerance \nvalue. If desired, relative abundance measures can \nbe used in biotic indexes. An example of a \nwidely used biotic index (Hilsenhoff, 1977, 1982) \nis as follows: \nwhere: \nn, = Number of individuals in taxon i \na, = Tolerance value assigned to taxon \ni \nn = Total number of individuals in the \nsample. \nTolerance values can be found in Hilsenhoff \n(1987) or can be generated by regional-specific \nknowledge of the organisms\u2019 tolerances. Typical \nranges of organism index values are O-5,0-10, or \nO-11, with the higher numbers indicating greater \ntolerance to pollutants. Community indexes are \ngenerally limited to lotic systems impacted by \norganic enrichment (Woodiwiss, 1964, Chandler, \n1970; Hilsenhoff, 1977; Murphy, 1978; DePauw \nel al., 1986) or other general perturbations \n(Hawkes, 1979). Biotic indexes based on a \nspecific population, rather than community, are \naddressed in the \u201cIndicator Organisms\u201d discussion \nbelow. Although the first widely appIied biotic \nindex in this country was developed by Beck \n(1955) for Florida streams, the Hilsenhoff Biotic \nIndex (Hilsenhoff, 1977, 1982) has gained great popularity and has been updated to revise the \nscoring system from a range of O-5 to O-11 (Hil- \nsenhoff, 1987) and to include a family-level biotic \nindex (Hilsenhoff, 1988). Because the biotic \nindexes rely heavily on known pollutiontoleranczs \nof the taxa, Washington (1984), Mason et ol. \n(1985), and Hawkes (1979) preferred the biotic \nindexes over the diversity indexes for water \nquality assessments. The success of the Hilstn- \nhoff Biotic Index prompted use of the index, or \nmodifications of it, in several state programs (e.g., \nWisconsin, lllinois, New York, North Carolina) \nand EPA (Plafkin dr al., 1989) programs. Unfor- \ntunately, tolerance values are not available for \nmany taxa because they tend not to exhibit water \nquality preferences, and the assessments are \ngenerally limited to organic enrichment. Wash- \nington (1984) provides an outstanding review of \nthe history and uses of these indexes. \nIndkator Organisms--Indicator organisms have \nplayed a key role in the development of biotic \nindexes for both lotic and lentic systems. One of \nthe first classifications based on indicator organ- \nisms was done in the lllinois River by Richardson \n(1928). Simpson and Bode (1980), Bode and \nSimpson (1982), and Rae (1989), among many \nothers, used Chironomidae as indicator organisms \nfor a variety of toxicants in stream systems. \nHawkes (1979) provides an excellent review of \nthe use of benthic macroinvertebrates for stream \nquality assessments, and Wiederholm (1980) does \nthe same for lake systems. Data analyses for \nbenthic macroinvertebrates in lentic systems have \nnot been as progressive as those in lotic systems \nwith regard to composite indexes and have relied \nextensively. on enumerations, diversity indexes, \nrichness values, and indicator organisms (Fitchko, \n1986). Howmiller and Scott (1977), Krieger \n(1984), and Lauritsen et al. (1985) used oligo- \nchaete communities to establish a Great Iakes \ntrophic index. Lafont (1984) also used oligo- \nchaetes to indicate fme sediment pollution. \nBriirkhurst et al. (1%8) and Winnell and White \n(1985) used chironomids to develop a similar \nindex for the Great Lakes, and Courtetnan& \n(1987) classified Maine lakes using chironanid \nlarvae similar to the studies of Saether (1979) and \n8-11 \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \nAagaard (1986) in European lakes. Hart and \nFuller (1974) presented pollution ecology data for \na number of freshwater benthic macroinverte- \nbrates, as did U.S. EPA\u2019s pollulion tolerance \ninformation series on Chironomidae (Beck, 1977), \nTrichoptera (caddisflies) (Harris and Lawrence, \n1978), Ephemeroptera (mayflies) (Hubbard and \nPeters, 1978), and Plecoptera (stoneflies) (Surdick \nand Gauh, 1978). Wasbington (1984) also \nreviewed population-based biotic indexes. \nRiaaess Measures-Richness measures are \nbased on the presence or absence of selected taxa. \nCommonly used measures include the total num- \nber of taxa, the number of EPT (Ephemeroptera, \nPlecoptera, and Trichoptera), and the number of \nfamilies. The higher the richness value is, the \nbetter the quality of the system. Richness mea- \nsures have been shown to have low variability and \nhigh accuracy in identifying impact (Resh, 1988) \nand should be applied in each study. \nEnumerations-Enumerations involve obtaining \na sample quantified by surface area to obtain \nspecific abundances of each taxon. Examples \ninclude the number of total individuals, number of \nEPT individuals, ratios of number of individuals \nwithin a taxon to the total number of individuals \n(Ohio EPA, 1989a; Resb, 1988), and ratios of the \nnumber of individuals within one taxonomic group \n(e.g., EPT) to the number of individuals within \nanother taxonomic group (e.g., Chironomidae) \n(Plafkin et ol., 1989; Resh, 1988). Interpretation \nof the enumeration ratios can be difficult without \nprior validaGon. Most possible enumerations \ncomparing individual taxa to the total number of \nindividuals are done for many studies, although \nthe results may not be presented. The percent \ncontribution of the individuals within a taxon at a \nsample site can be compared with the percent \ncontribution at the reference sites to detect a \nchange in community structure. Resh (1988) \nconcluded that the seven common enumerations he \ntested bad extremely high variability and unac- \nceptably low accuracy in detecting various im- \npacts, and he suggested that they are not as useful \nfor detecting environmental change as richness measures or the family biolic index. Although the \nmeasures Resh (1988) used may not be optimal \nfor widespread use, they may still provide insight \ninto changes in the community structure. Ohio \nEPA (1989a) has successfully used enumerations \nfor the percentage of mayflies, caddisflies, Tany- \niarsini midges, tolerant organisms, and \u201cother\u201d \ndipterans combined with non-insec! individuals as \na basis for their stale biocriteria. \nSimilarity Indexdrnmunity similarity index- \nes measure the similarity between benthic corn- \nmunities at a reference and a study site, with high \nsimilarity indicating little change, or impact, \nbetween the two sites. The use of similarity \nindexes has been reviewed by Brock (1977) and \nWashington (1984). The simplest indexes to \napply are ibose which use only the types of taxa \nfound, not the abundance of the organisms within \neach taxon. The Jaccard Index (1908) and Van \nHorn\u2019s Index (1950) are examples of the simpler \nindexes. Van Horn\u2019s Index, used by Ohio EPA \n(1989b), is as follows: \n2W \nwhere: \na = Number of taxa collected at one \nsite \nb = Number of taxa collected at the \nolher site \nw = Number of taxa common to both \nstations. \nA value over 6.5 or 7.0 indicates good similarity. \nPlafkin et al. (1989) use the Jaccard Index in the \nrapid bioassessment protocols (RBPs). Other \nindexes such as the percent similarity (Brock \n1977) and the Bray-Curtis (1957) use the abun- \ndance of organisms. \nFunctional Information-Community function \nmeasurements based on habitat, trophic structure, \nand other ecological measures were described by \nKaesler et al. (1978) and used by Rooke and \n8-12 \n9Freshwata Bent& Mt~~-~brvcrtebr~tc Commurity Structure and Function \nMackie (1982a) as the \u201cecological community \nanalysis\u201d (EGA). Rooke and Mackie (1982b) \nreported the EGA to provide more information on \nenvironmental quality than diversity or biotic \nindexes, but the EGA was very time-consuming \nand not practical for rapid assessments. However, \nCummins and Wilzbach (1985) and Cummins \n(1988) descrbe a rapid assessment method based \non sampling coarse particulate organic matter and \ndetermining the functional feeding groups de- \nscribed in Merritt and Cummins (1984). This \nmethod is recommended in EPA\u2019s RBPs (Plafkin \net al., 1989). Rabeni er al. <1985) also described \nthe usefulness of a functional feeding group \napproach to provide a \u201cmore ecologically sound \nclassification of water quality\u201d during their devel- \nopment of a biotic index for paper mill impacts. \nAnother useful measure of function is observations \nof the incidence of morphological deformities in \nbenthic macroinvertebrates, similar to the observa- \ntions made for Karr\u2019s Index of Biotic Integrity \n(IBI) for fish (Karr et al., 1986). Deformities \nhave been associated with exposure of metals and \norganic compounds to Chironomidae (Cushman, \n1984; Cushman and Goyert, 1984; Wiederholm, \n1984b; Warwick, 1985; Warwick et al., 1987) and \nTrichoptera (Simpson, 1980; Petersen and Peter- \nsen, 1983). Karr and Kerans (1992) are develop- \ning an invertebrate IBI and have evaluated 10 \ntrophic and functional feeding group metrics. \nThis promising work is continuing. \nStatistical Approaches-Various statistical \napproaches have been applied to determine wheth- \ner the benthic community at a study site varies \nfrom that at a reference or other site. An excel- \nlent discussion of this issue appears in Klemm et \n~1. (1990) and USEPA (1992b). Depending on \nthe chosen endpoints of the study, rigorous statis- \ntical analysis may not be necessary. For instance, \nif the endpoint is the number of taxa or richness \nmeasures, the variability is generally quite low and \naccuracy quite high. In this case, the differences \nbetween two communities would need to be \nevaluated based on study objectives. A \u201cstatisti- \ncal\u201d difference between two communities will not \nalways indicate whether more subtle changes in \ncommunity composition are occurring or whether mitigation may be warranted before a statistical \nchange occurs. Sometimes when that change \noccurs, it is too late to protect the community. \nUSEPA (1992b) has an outstanding discussion on \napplying uncertainty to decision-making. The \nsame data evaluation procedures apply to both the \nmarine and freshwater systems. The reader is \nreferred to the statistical discussion in Chapter 9 \n(marine bentbic community structure). \nBivariate and multivariate analysis are often \napplied in benthic studies to define relationships \nbetween and among variables. Examples of these \nanalyses include analysis of variance (ANOVA), \ncorrelations, regressions (including multiple \nregressions), and the two-sample t-test. A major \ndrawback to these methods is the assumption that \nthe data follow a statistical distribution such as a \nnormal or lognormal distribution. This assump \ntion is often invalid when dealing with biological \npopulations and communities. \nAlternatively, nonparametric analyses may be \nconducted. Such analyses are not based on as- \nsumptions about a specific distribution of the data. \nExamples of such tests include the chi-square test, \nbinomial tests, rank correlations, or tests compara- \nble to the t-test such as the Mann-Whitney test. \nWhichever statistical methods are employed, all \ndata assumptions must be clearly stated and \nobjectives known. \n8.2.1.2.4 Necessary Hardware and Ski& \nThe hardware needed for field collection \nincludes samplers (e.g., dredges, dip-nets), sieves, \nbenthic macroinvertebrate containers, forceps, \nwhite enamel pans, ethanol preservative, and \nappropriate personal gear (e.g., hip boots or chest- \nwaders, life vest if needed, and first aid kits). For \nthe laboratory, standard biological laboratory \nequipment should be available, such as micro- \nscopes (both dissecting and compound), forceps, \nmicroscope slides and cover slips, ethanol, potassi- \num hydroxide, mounting media, and sieves. A \npersonal computer (containing a 2O-MB or larger \nhard drive) is important for storing and analyzing \nthe data. \nTrained bentbic macroinvertebrate field biolo- \ngists and taxonomists are needed for benthic \n8-13 \nSahent Classijication Methods Compendium \ncommunity assessments. At least one should be \nproficient at identifications beyond the family \nlevel. That taxonomist should remain involved \nuntil the proficiency of the identifier in reaching \nfamily-level identifications is ensured. A mini- \nmum of a Master of Science degree in a related \ndiscipline is usually required for the taxonomist to \nhave learned the necessary skills. However, \nadequate training is commonly available through \ntaxonomy courses and workshops that can provide \nthe necessary proficiency without an advanced \ndegree. A demonstration of proficiency by accur- \nately identifying a check sample prepared by U.S. \nEPA or a state agency is important. A trained \nbenthic ecologist is necessary to compile and \ninterpret the data. Although it would be ideal if \nthe benthic ecologist had a rigorous statistical \nbackground, consultation with a statistician should \nbe adequate. \n8.2.1.3 Adiyacy of Documentation \nThere is ample documentation of both field \nmethods and analytical techniques. The Journul of \nthe North American 23enthoiogical Society is a prime \nw;rce of this information, as is technical exchange \nat professional meetings. Furthermore, there is a \nlarge volume of published and unpublished material \nthat documents use of this method (USEPA 1992d, \n199le, 199Og, 1989f, 1988a). \n8.22 Applicability of Method b Human \nHealth, Aquatic Life, or Wildufe \nR-&CtlOIl \nThis method is directly applicable to the protec- \ntion of aquatic life since it is based on direct mea- \nsurements of benthic macroinvertebrates. This \nmethod is directly applicable to the protection of \nthose aquatic organisms (e.g., fwh) and wildlife that \ndirectly feed on benthic macroinvertebrates (e.g., \nsmall mammals and wading shorebirds). It is \nindirectly appIicable to other wildlife that depend on \nbenthos at other levels in the food chain. This \nmethod is also indirectly applicable to the protection \nof human health since benthic mauoinverlebrates \ntin serve as indicators of toxicant impacts that may \naffect humans via bioaccumulation pathways 8.2.3 Abllity of Method to Generate \nNumerical Criteria for Spcclfk \nCbcmlcds \nThis method is used in conjunction with \nsediment toxicity and chemistry data to charac- \nterize toxicant impacts and assist with determin- \ning the appropriate levels at which the toxicants \nshould be controlled. By itself, however, this \nmethod would not be used to generate chemical- \nspecific criteria. \n8.3 USEFULNESS \n8.3.1 Environmental Applkabilfty \nBenthic macroinvertebrates have been rou- \ntinely used to assess environmental quality in a \nvariety of geographical areas and ecoregions, as \nwas discussed in Section 8.1. \n8.3.1.1 Suitability for Different Sediment Types \nAssessment of the freshwater benthic macro- \ninvertebrate community structure is well suited \nfor evaluating different sediment types since the \nbenthos inhabit all substrates (Merrit and Cum- \nmins, 1984). Comparisons should be made \namong benthic communities of similar substrate \nsince different types and numbers of organisms \nwill inhabit different types of substrates. \n8.3.1.2 Suitability far Diflerent Chemicals or \nClasses of Chemicals \nBenthic macroinvertebrate communities are \nroutinely used to assess potential impacts caused \nby many different chemicals or classes of chemi- \ncals. In addition to the uses described in Sec- \ntion 8.1.1.1 of this chapter, many benthic organ- \nisms are used to indicate stresses from specific \nchemicals or classes of chemicals (Brinkhurst et \nal., 1968; Hart and Fuller, 1974; Saether, 1979; \nSimpson and Bode, 1980; Wiederholm, 1980; \nBode and Simpson, unpublished; Winnell and \nWhite, 1985; Aagaard, 1986; and Fitchko, \n1986). \n8-14 \ng-Freshwater Bent?& Macr&wertebrak Community Structure and Function \n8.3.1.3 Suitability for Predicting Efiects on \nDiflerent Organisms \nThe use of benthic macroinvertebrates as \nindicator organisms has already been discussed. \nBenthic macroinvertebrates can be used to pre- \ndict the effects on other aquatic organisms be- \ncause if the benthic macroinvertebrate communi- \nty is impacted, then the impact is likely to be, or \nalready has been, detrimental to other organisms. \n8.3.1.4 Suitability for In-Place Pollutant Control \nBenthic macroinvertebrates will best indicate \nin-place pollutant control needs through a site- \nspecific knowledge of surface water quality, \nhabitat quality, and sediment chemistry and toxici- \nty. Alone, the benthic macroinvertebrates can be \nused to screen for potential sources of sediment \ncontamination based on spatial gradients in corn- \nmunity structure, but they should not be used \nalone to definitively determine sediment quality or \nto develop chemical-specific guidelines. The \nbenthic data must be integrated with other avail- \nable data to determine sediment quality using a \n\u201cweight-of-evidence\u201d approach. \n831.5 Suitability for Source Control \nBenthic macroinvertebrates have been exten- \nsively used for source characterization and control in \nmany of the state and U.S. EPA monitoring pro- \ngrams involving spatial surveys upstream and down- \nstream of suspected sources (Ohio EPA, 1987; Bode \nand Novak, 1988; Courtemanch and Davies, 1988; \nFiske, 1988; Maret, 1988; Penrose and Ovexton, \n1988; Shakelford, 1988; USEPA, 1991c, 1988a, \n198Sb; Fandrei, 1989). If a detrimental change is \ndetected in the bentbic macroinvertebrate community \nand that change can be attriiutable to a source, then \ncontrol measures can be implemented through the \nNPDES permit program. Many states aggressively \npursue this action. \n8.3.1.6 Sui&bifi& for Disposal Applications \nThe discussion presented in Section 9.3.1.6 of \nQapter 9 (marine benthic macroinvertebrate com- munity structure) is applicable to fresh water. \nRecenrly bent& community assessments have been \nrequired by U.S. EPA Region V, as stated in the \nDraft In&rim Guidance for the Design and Zhxu- \nbon of Sediment Sampling E~~oH.T Relating to Navi- \ngational Maintenance Dredging in Region V - Mhy \n1989 (USEPA, MM). In this guidance, be&tic \nlllX7OiIlVertebrate assessments are advised for areas \nthat are suitable for open-lake disposal or for sedi- \nments that are difficult to characterize. All benthic \ncommunity assessments will be made in concert with \nsediment chemistry and toxicity evaluations. \n83.2 Gcnerpl Advantages and Umttatbns \nThe advantage of using the benthic macroin- \nvertebrates community assessment approach to \ndetermining sediment quality is that it provides an \neconomical and accurate indication of the health of \nthe system under study, and it is based at dire& \nobsetvation rather than theoretically derived data. \nThe major limitation is the difficulty in relating the \nfindings to the presence of individual chemicak and \nspecific concentrations of those chemicals for numer- \nic in-place pollutant management. This method \nshould be integrated with sediment chemistry and \ntoxicity information. \n83.2.1 Ease of Use \nThe equipment requirements for benthic surveys \nis minimal aad inexpensive compared to those for \nchemical/physical analyses or even toxicity tests. \nThe organisms are easy to obtain, but difficult to sort \nand identity. All materials needed for benthic \nassessments are easily obtained through chemical and \nbiological supply a>mpanies and require no special \nmechanical setup or calibration. \n83.2.2 Relative Cost \nThe cost for benthic maaoinvertebrate assess- \nments is economical compared to that for chemis- \ntry or toxicological evaluations. Ohio EPA \n(1990a) provided a cost of about $700 to conduu \na benthic assessment at one sample site. Howev- \ner, this cost included overhead (e.g., rent, office \nequipment), all travel expenses, time spent in the \n8-M \nSaiiment Classifiuation M&ads Compendium \nfield, and report preparation. Ohio EPA conducts \nartificial substrate (composite of five substrates) \nsampling in addition to natural substrate (multi- \nhabitat) sampling at each site. Their cost of \n$1,099 ($824 for artificial substrates and $275 for \nqualitative samples) was quite economical com- \npared to chemical/physical testing ($1,653) or \nbioassay testing ($3,000 to $12,000) for each site. \nPlafkin et UL (1989) discussed staff requirements \nfor sample collection and analysis. \nThe most expensive items are the samplers \nand the microscopes to identify the organisms. \nHowever, most state programs and contractors \nhave this equipment available for other program \nneeds. The fieldwork can be conducted during the \ntime it takes to collect a sediment sample. \u2018Ihe \nmost time-consuming aspect is the laboratory \nsorting and identifications, which may average 11 \nhours per site. However, this process compares \nfavorably with the amount of time required to set \nup and run a toxicity test or to prepare and ana- \nlyze chemical variables. \n8.3.23 Tendency to Be Conservative \nThe benthic macroinvertebrate community \nassessment provides a conservative measure, since \nthe community is responding to both temporal and \nspatial perturbations. There are few chances, if any, \nof obtaining a result indicating a high-quality com- \nmunity when an impact occurs. Because of influ- \nences other than sedimentMater quality, it is more \ncommon to observe an impacted community when \nthere is no sediment/water quality impact. Although \nthe primary focus is on community-level infor- \nmation, changes in individual populations could also \nbe addressed. However, the ecological significance \nof population changes may not be evident until the \ncommunity is affected. \nIn a review of surface water chemistry and \nbenthic macroinvertebrate community assessments \nover t300 water body segment sites in Ohio, bioai- \nteria based on benthic macroinvertebrates were more \nsensitive (conservative) indicators of water quality \n(Ohio EPA, 199Ob). In 495 percent of the seg- \nments, the benthic and frsb assessment revealed \nimpacts not detected by chemical water quality \nstandards violations. In 47.4 percent of the sites, the chemical and biological assessment supporte4I one \nanother. Only 2.8 percent of the sites did not have \na biological impact when the chemistry indicated \nthat there would be one. \n8.3.2.4 Level of Acceptance \nBenthic macroinvertebrate community asseS- \nme&s of sediment,&vater quality have been used in \nfreshwater systems since the early 1900s \n(Richardson, 1928). Most of the methods employed \ntoday have been widely accepti for use, although \nthe use of function measurements is not as well \ndocumented. Perhaps the single most important \ndemonstration of the level of acceptance of benthic \nassessments is the growing regulatory use and estab- \nlishment of numerical biological criteria in state \nwater quality standards. \n8.3.2.5 Ability to Be tmplemented by L-aboratoties \nwith Qpical Equipment and Handhg \nF&li&kS \nThe only special pieces of equipment required \nare the samplers and sieves, which are easily ob- \ntained from biological supply warehouses. Most \nbiological laboratories will have disseding and \ncompound micro~~pes, chemical reagents, micro- \nscope slides and cover slips, forceps, and any other \nmaterials needed. The laboratory\u2019s capability to \nidentify benthic macroinvertebrates is less common. \nTaxonomy is not a widespread skill and is more \nlikely to be found in consulting fums than in analy- \ntical laboratories. \n8.3.2.6 Level of Eflort Required to Generate \nResulti \nDepending on the study objectives and level \nof effort needed, results can be generated in \nwritten form in as little as 1 day (Plafkin et al. \n1989) or in several months. For example, Ohio \nEPA processes over 500 individual benthic sam- \nples each year, identifies the organisms, and \nprepares reports for regulatory use in less than 1 \nyear, with fewer than three full-time employees in \ntheir benthic macroinvertebrate unit. The critical \nperiod is the turnaround time for the taxonomy. \n8-16 \nPFreshwater Benthic Macroinvertebrate Community Structure and Function \nWith artificial substrates, an additional 6-week \ncolonization period is required, unless a rapid \nassessment or moderate sized study is done, a \nwritten report including interpretation of results \nwill typically require between 6 months and 1 \nYear- \n8.3.2.7 Degree to Which Results Lend \nThemselves to Interpretatiun \nIt is never advisable to have an individual \nwithout training in benthic ecology interpret benthic \ndata. Once the benthic ecologist provides a repoxt \nwith recommendations, the results can be easily \nimplemented into a management strategy. Al- \nthough several numerical indexes that appear simple \nto use are available, data interpretation relies on all \nof the information generated for a study, including \nchemical, physical, and toxicological measurements, \nas well as indicator organisms and function mea- \nsures. \n8.3.2.8 Degree of Environmental Applicability \nBenthic macroinvertebrate community strudure \nand function is used extensively to evaluate sedi- \nment and water quality and characterize impacts in \nlotic and lentic freshwater ecosystems. \n8.3.2.9 Degree of Accuracy and Precision \nSince benthic macroinvertebrates are measured \ndirectly, this method is highly accurate for charac- \nterizing sediment&vater quality effects on aquatic \nlife. There is little chance, if any, that a high- \nquality community will be indicated when an \nimpact actually occurs (Type II error with a null \nhypothesis of no community change). Because of \ninfluences other than sedimentiater quality, it is \nmore common to observe an impacted community \nwhen there is no sediment/quality impact (Type I \nerror .with a null hypothesis of no community \nchange). For environmental pollution control, a \nType II error is much more serious than a Type I \nerror, which is conservative. To reduce the possi- \nbility of a Type II error, the data (including chem- \nistry and toxicity) must be interpreted by a trained \nbenthic ecologist. Resh (1988) and USEPA (1992b) reviewed the levels of accuracy and preci- \nsion for several of the data analysis techniques. \nTo ensure as much accuracy and precision in \nthe data as possible, a detailed Quality Assurance \nProgram Plan should be established and followed. \nCareful and consistent field and laboratory v \ncolsarenecessary. Itisalsomceswytosample \nduring optimal conditions, which can minimize the \neffects of natural variations in the data. However, \nthe natural variability, especially seasonal, is re- \nduced when using a community-level approa& \nrather than a population-level approach. \n8.4 STATUS \nSections 8.1.1 (Current Uses) and 8.3 (Useful- \nness) desaii the status of the discipline. \n8.4.1 Extent of Use \n?his method is widely used in both regulatory \nand nonregulatory sediment and water quality \nprograms. It has been used to assess impacts due \nto organic enrichment and a variety of chemical \nclasses in both lotic and lentic systems. Benthic \nmacroinvertebrate community assessments are the \nmost widely used instream biological measures in \nstate water quality programs. \n8.4.2 Extent to Which Approach Has been \nField-Validated \nSince it is an in siru study, field validation \noccurs when the approach can consistently and \naccurately assess environmental quality. Most \nbenthic studies employ reference stations and rely \non other environmental data to validate the method. \nThe documentation provided in this paper should \npresent adequate documentation of the method\u2019s \nvalidity. \n8.43 Reasons for Ilmited use \nBenthic macroinvertebrate community assess- \nments are very common in freshwater systems \nbecause of their relatively low cost and high infor- \nmation output. \n8-17 \nSediment Class$c&m Methods Comptndium \n8.4.4 Outlook for Future Use sad Amount \nof Jkvdopmeat Yet Needed \nThe outlook for the future use of benthic \nmacroinvertebrate community structure and func- \ntion in sediment quality assessment is very good \nbecause of the recognition that benthic macro- \ninvertebrates provide substantial information that \nthe chemistry and toxicity data alone cannot \nprovide. With the Clean Water Act mandate to \nmaintain and restore biological integrity, benthic \ncommunity assessments can help determine wheth- \ner sediment quality is impairing the designated \nuses and biotic integrity. With the increasing \nreliance on numerical biocriteria, additional sedi- \nment quality problems will be identified. The area \nwhere development is most needed is in combin- \ning benthic community assessments with chemical \nand toxicological data in an integrated approach \nfor assessing sediment quality. In addition, the \nfunctional measures, which also hold much prom- \nise for sediment assessments, need to be validated \nmore thoroughly. \n8.5 REFERENCES \nAagaard, K. 1986.

In most \nbenthic community structure assessments, primary \nemphasis is placed on determining the species that \nare present and the distribution of individuals \namong those species. These community attributes \nare emphasized largely for pragmatic reasons. \nAlthough it is relatively simple to collect, identify, \nand enumerate benthic organisms, it is very \ndifficult to determine first-hand the spatial distri- \nbutions of species and individuals within the \nbenthic habitat, or the functional interactions that \noccur among the resident organisms or between \nthe resident organisms and the abiotic habitat. \nHence, information on benthic community compo- \nsition and abundance is typically used in conjunc- \ntion with information in the scientific literature to \ninfer the distributions of species and individuals in \nthree-dimensional space and the functional attri- \nbutes of the community. Because ail of the major \nstructural and functional attributes of benthic \ncommunities are affected by sediment quality in \ngenerally predictable ways, benthic community \nstructure assessment is a valuable tool for evaluat- \ning sediment quality and its effects on a major \nbiological component of marine, estuarine, and \nfreshwater ecosystems. \nBenthic habitats may be broadly divided into \nhard-bottom habitats and soft-bottom habitats. \nMany types of each exist in marine, estuarine, and \nfreshwater ecosystems. Hard-bottom habitats \ninclude rocky shorelines and bottoms of lentic and \nlotic systems, rocky intertidal and subtidal habitats \nin marine and estuarine systems, and coral reefs. \nSoft-bottom habitats include mud and sand habi- \ntats in marine, estuarine, and freshwater systems; \nmarine, estuarine, and freshwater macrophyte \nbeds; freshwater wetlands; and estuarine salt marshes. Each of these habitats requires different \nsample collection methods and different survey \ndesign considerations. The emphasis of this \nchapter is on assessments of marine benthic \ncommunity structure in soft-bottom habitats as an \nindicator of sediment quality. Freshwater benthic \ninvertebrate community structure is discussed in \nChapter 8. \n9.1 SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS \nAssessment of benthic community structure is \nan in situ method that can be used alone, as part \nof other approaches [e.g., Sediment Quality Triad \n(see Chapter 10) and Apparent Effects Threshold \n(AET) (see Chapter 11)], or in combination with \nother sediment assessment techniques (e.g., sedi- \nment toxicity bioassays). It is commonly used in \nthree ways to assess impacts to benthic communi- \nties and sediment quality: \n\u2022 To compare test and reference stations, \nfor the purpose of determining the spatial \nextent and magnitude of such impacts; \n\u2022 To identify spatial gradients of impacts; \nand \n\u2022 To identify temporal trends at the same \nlocations through time. \nBy definition, benthic communities include all \norganisms living on or in the bottom substrate. \nFor practical reasons, assessments of benthic \ncommunity structure in soft sediments usually rely \non the macrofauna (i.e., organisms retained on a \nl.0- or 0.5-mm sieve) and to a lesser extent the \nmeiofauna (i.e., multicellular organisms that pass \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \nthrough a l.0- or 0.5-mm sieve). Reasons for the \nmore limited use of meiofauna are twofold: \n\u2022 Although they may be sampled quantita- \ntively, their small size makes working \nwith them difficult, and the taxonomy of \nmany of the groups (e.g., nematodes) is \nnot well known. \n\u2022 The functional attributes of the various \nmeiofaunal taxa are poorly known, and it \nis therefore difficult to interpret the im- \nportance of the presence or absence of the \nvarious taxa in relation to environmental \nquality. (For example, knowledge of \nmeiofaunal taxa that respond positively or \nnegatively to organic enrichment of the \nsediments is extremely limited.) \nDifficulties in quantitatively sampling other size \nclasses of benthic organisms such as the mega- \nfauna (i.e., large organisms that are typically \nmeasured in centimeters) and the microfauna (i.e., \nmicrobes) usually preclude them from consider- \nation in assessments of benthic community struc- \nture. Furthermore, although the functional impor- \ntance of sediment microbes has been studied, their \nstructural and functional characteristics have not \nbeen used as indicators of sediment quality. \n9.1.1 Current Use \nAssessments of benthic community structure \nhave been used to describe reference conditions, \nbaseline conditions, and the effects of natural and \nanthropogenic disturbances. Selected examples of \ncurrent uses of this approach are provided below. \nOrganic Enrichment-Pearson and Rosen- \nberg (1978) performed an extensive review of \nbenthic community succession in relation to \norganic enrichment of marine and estuarine sedi- \nments. Based on that review, they developed a \ngeneralized model of structural community chang- \nes (i.e., numbers of species, abundances, biomass) \nin relation to organic enrichment, and identified \nopportunistic and pollution-tolerant species that \nare indicative of organic enrichment. Concepts \ndeveloped by Pearson and Rosenberg (1978) have \nsubsequently been used by many investigators to assess the degree of organic enrichment that has \noccurred in a variety of soft-bottom habitats. For \nexample, Dauer and Conner (1980) assessed the \neffects of sewage inputs on benthic polychaete \npopulations in a Florida estuary by collecting \ninformation on the total number of individuals, \ntotal biomass, and average number of species. \nThey compared the sewage-affected site with a \nreference site and examined the response of \nindividual species to organic enrichment. In \nanother study in Florida, Grizzle (1984) identified \nindicator species based on life history responses to \norganic enrichment and other physicochemical \nchanges. The taxa identified as indicator species \nin enriched areas were generally characterized by \nopportunistic life history strategies. Vidakovic \n(1983) assessed the influence of domestic sewage \non the density and distribution of meiofauna in the \nNorthern Adriatic Sea. He concluded that raw \ndomestic sewage did not have a negative influence \non the density and distribution of meiofauna, but \nthe nematode/copepod ratio (Parker, 1975) indicat- \ned that these. stations were under stress. \nContamination Due to Toxic Metals and \nMetalloids-Rygg (1985a, 1986) assessed benthic \ncommunity structure in Norwegian fjords where \nthe disposal of mine tailings had resulted in metals \ncontamination of the sediment. His studies \nshowed an inverse relationship between concentra- \ntions of metals in the sediment and the species \nrichness and abundance of the benthic macro- \ninvertebrate fauna. Bryan et al. (1987) examined \npopulation distributions of the oyster Ostrea \nedulisy, the polychaete Nereis diversicolor, and \nthe cockle Cerastoderma edule in relation to \nwastes from metals mining in the Fal Estuary. \nThey concluded that the distribution of species is \ndependent on their ability to tolerate copper and \nzinc, and on the capabilities of a population to \ndevelop a resistance to metals and thereby main- \ntain their original distribution range. \nContamination Due to Toxic Organic Com- \npounds-Toxic organic compounds are frequently \nassociated with municipal discharges, industrial \neffluents, and storm drains. These discharges may \nalso result in organic enrichment and contamina- \ntion by metals or metalloids. The following \nbenthic studies provided evaluations of sediment \n9-2 \n94arinc Benthic Community Structure Assesmmt \nquality in areas primarily affected by toxic organic \ncompounds: \nn Czeosote contamination. Tagatz et ol. \n(1983) examined the benthic communities \nthat colonized uncontaminated sediments \nand sediments contaminated with three \ndifferent concentrations of creosote (177, \n844, and 4,428 pg/g) in field and labora- \ntory aquaria to assess the effects of \nmarine-grade creosote on community \nstructure. Numbers of individuals and \nnumbers of species in field-colonized \ncommunities were significantly lower in \nall three creosote-contaminated sediments \nthan in the controls. In the laboratory- \ncolonized communities only the two \nhigher creosote concentrations had re- \nduced numbers of individuals and species. \nDistribution of individuals within species \nwas similar for the laboratory and field \nassemblages of animals. \nn Oil contamination. Elmgren et of. (1983) \ndetermined that acute effects of the Tsesir \noil spill were noted after 16 days on both \nthe macrofauna and meiofauna. Initial \nrecovery was noted 2 yr after the spill. \nHowever, the authors predicted that com- \nplete recovery would require at least 5 yr. \nJackson et al. (1989) investigated the ef- \nfects of spilled oil on the Panamanian \ncoast and found that shallow subtidal reef \ncorals and the infauna of seagrass beds \nhad experienced extensive mortality. \nAfter 15 yr, only some of the organisms \nin areas exposed to the open sea had \nrecovered. Clifton et al. (1984) per- \nformed field experiments in Willapa Bay, \nWashington, and found that oil in the \nsediments modified the burrowing behav- \nior of infaunal benthos. \nDredging and Construction-Related Activi- \nties-Swartz et al. (1980) examined species \nrichness and species abundances just before \ndredging occurred in Yaquina Bay, Oregon, and \nfor 2 yr after dredging. Benthic community \nrecolonization was followed from the appearance of opportunistic taxa through their replacement by \nless tolerant taxa. Rhoads ef ol. (1978) examined \nthe influence of dredge-spoil disposal on be&tic \ninfaunal succession in Long Island Sound by \nclassifying species into groups based on their ap- \npear8nce in a disturbed area. They suggested that \nthe \u201cequilibrium community is less productive \nthan a pioneering stage\u201d and suggested that pro- \nductivity may be enhanced through managed \ndisturballcts. The abundance of polychaetes, \nmolluscs, and crustaceans is currently used to help \nassess potential biological effects of dredged \nmaterial disposal by the Puget Sound Dredged \nDisposal Analysis Program (SAIC, 1991; Striplin \net al., 1991). \nNatural Disturbances-Most stud&s of \nnatural disturbances have assessed the recovery of \nbenthic communities after the disturbance (e.g., \nlarge storms and associated wave activity, oxygen \ndepletion, salinity reductions, El Nifio). For \nexample, Dobbs and Vozarik (1983) sampled \nstations before and after Storm David and ob- \nserved that the number of species decreased after \nthe storm. They also documented changes in the \nrank order of the dominant taxa. Santos and \nSimon (1980) examined defaunation of benthic \ncommunities before, during, and after annual \nhypoxia in Biscayne Bay. They documented that \nrecolonization occurs fairly rapidly after the \ndefaunation period. Oscillations in macrobenthic \npopulations in the shallow waters of the Peruvian \ncoast were examined by Tarazona ef 41. (1988). \nFluctuations in density, biomass, species composi- \ntion, and diversity were attributed to the El Niiio \nof 1982-1983. \nAssessment of benthic community structure is \nalso used as a component of other sediment \nquality assessment tools. Along with sediment \nchemistry and sediment toxicity bioassays, it is \none of three components of the Sediment Quality \nTriad (see Chapter 10). It is also a component of \nthe Apparent Effects Threshold approach (see \nChapter 11). \n9.1.2 Potential Use \nTo date, benthic community assessments \nperformed to evaluate sediment quality have \n9-3 \nSediment Class~~tion Methods Compendium \nfocused on the relationships between community \nvariables (e.g., numbers of species, total abun- \ndance, biomass) and measures of sediment quality \n(e.g., organic content, concentrations of chemical \ncontaminants). Only for organic enrichment have \nindividual species been identified that are indica- \ntive of various degrees of sediment alteration [see \nfor example Pearson and Rosenberg (1978), Word \net al. (1977)J. Moreover, for only a very few \nspecies has the autecological relationship between \norganic enrichment of the sediments and an \nindividual species been explored. [For example, \nFabrikant (1984) explored the autecology of the \nbivalve mollusc Parvilucina tenuisculpta in rela- \ntion to organic enrichment of the sediments in the \nSouthern California Bight.] A tremendous poten- \ntial exists, however, for identifying species that \nare indicative (by their persistence, enhanced \nabundance, reduced abundance, or absence) of \nsediment contaminants at various concentrations. \nThe identification of such taxa will not be simple \nbecause of the complex ecological interactions that \noccur within benthic communities, and because \nsediments are frequently contaminated with a \nmixture of chemicals. A first step in this process \nmight be to attempt to identify species or suites of \nspecies that could be used to separate the effects \nof sediment organic enrichment from sediment \ncontamination by toxic substances. \nAnother potential use of benthic community \nassessments would be to predict recovery of \nbenthic habitats following the execution of reme- \ndial actions at contaminated sites. To date, it has \nnot been possible to use extant benthic community \nstructure to predict recovery because the only \nmodel that relates benthic community structure to \nsediment quality [i.e., the Pearson and Rosenberg \n(1978) model] is not quantitative. Quantification \nof this model and the development of quantitative \nmodels for other sediment contaminants will be \nrequired before benthic community assessments \ncan be used to predict sediment quality. A valu- \nable byproduct of such models would be the \nability to predict the capacity of the remediated \narea to support higher trophic level organisms that \nforage on benthic organisms, including commer- \ncially and recreationally harvested demersal fishes. 9.2 DESCRIPTION \n9.2.1 Deseriptioa of the Method \nAn assessment of benthic community structure \ntypically involves a field survey that includes \nreplicated sampling at each station; sorting and \nidentification of the organisms to species or lowest \npossible taxon; analyses of the numbers of taxa, \nnumbers of individuals, and sometimes biomass in \neach sample; and identification of the dominant \ntaxa. Results of the field survey are then inter- \npreted in conjunction with other sediment vari- \nables (e.g., sediment grain size, total organic \ncarbon) that were collected concurrently with the \nbenthic samples. \n9.2.1. I Objectives and Assumptions \nThe objective of the benthic community \nstructure approach is to identify degraded and \npotentially degraded sediments by examining the \ncommunities of organisms that inhabit those \nsediments. This empirical approach assumes the \nfollowing: \nn Because benthic infauna are generally \nsedentary, benthic community structure \nreflects the chemical and physical envi- \nronment at the sampling location. \nn Benthic community structure may be \naltered in a predictable manner over time \nand space by chemical or physical distur- \nbances. \nn The execution of proper data collection \nand analysis methods can reduce natural \nvariability of benthic infaunal data and \nenable the detection of trends in sediment \nquality. \n9.2.1.2 Level 0fEflor-t \nThe level of effort required to assess benthic \ncommunity structure is relatively high. Regardless \nof the analytical methods, a field survey is re- \nquired to collect the organisms. The sorting and \nidentification process is IaborGntensive and usu- \n94 \n9-Marine Ben thic Community Structure Assessment \nally expensive. Program objectives will determine \nwhether the data analyses are simple or complex. \n9.2.1.2.1 Type of Sampling Required \nThe type of sampling required to tolled benthic \norganisms is dependent on the objedives of the \nsampling program and on the area under study. \nUsually, the objective of a benthic sampling \nprogram is to study the characteristics of and the \nvariation in the benthic community that occupies \nspecific sampling stations. In this case, all organ- \nisms present in the sediment at that location are \nsampled together: those that normally reside in \nthe surface few centimeters of sediment and those \nthat normally reside deeper in the sediment (e.g., \nS-15 cm below the surface). In some instances, a \nsampling program may have a different objective. \nFor example, sampling for the Benthic Resources \nAnalysis Technique (BRAT) (Lunz and Kendall, \n1982) involves collecting box core samples and \ndetermining the biomass (and possibly the com- \nmunities) present in specific sediment strata (i.e., \nO-2 cm, 2-5 cm, 5-10 cm, and lo-15 cm below the \nsediment surface). In that technique, the benthic \ndata are compared with the benthic organisms \nconsumed by bottom-dwelling fish (as determined \nby gut content analyses of fish captured in the \nsame area) to determine the food value of the \nbenthos. \nCharacteristics of the area under study also \ninfluence the type of sampling. In intertidal or \nlittoral environments where sampling stations can \nbe occupied by walking to the site, samples are \nusually collected using a hand-held corer. If \nstations are located in subtidal areas, then remote \nsampling from a vessel is performed using a box \ncorer or grab sampler. Sediment grain size may \ninfluence final selection of the sampler. Some \nsamplers (i.e., many box corers) perform poorly in \nsandy sediments, whereas others (i.e., van Veen \ngrab, Smith-McIntyre grab) perform adequately in \na greater range of sediment types (i.e., tine to \nmedium sand, silt, silty clay). Methods and \nequipment for sampling infaunal communities are \nfurther described in several publications (Word, \n1976; Swartz, 1978; Eleftheriou and Holme, 1984; \nNalepa et al., 1988). Blomqvist (1991) provides an extensive review of quantitative sampling \nmethods, including a detailed bibliography of \npertinent papers. \nProgram objectives and knowledge of benthic \ncommunities in the study area will influence \nselection of the sieve size through which sediment \nsamples will be washed. It is important that the \nsieve mesh size-s be appropriate for the community \nunder study (e.g., 64 /an for meiofauna, 05 or 1.0 \nmm for maaofauna). Generally, the chances of \nretaining most macrofauna species and individuals \n(and therefore increasing sampling accuracy) are \nimproved by the use of a finer mesh (but, see \nBishop and Hartley, 1986). However, sieve size \nis an important determinant of the cost and level \nof effort necessary to obtain quantitative data. \nVery little difference in the field processing time \nexists between use of a 0.5~mm and a 1.0~mm \nsieve when sieving sediments finer than coarse \nsand, but laboratory analyses are much more time- \nconsuming when the smaller mesh is used because \nit retains more abiotic materials and many smaller \norganisms. \n9.2.1.2.2 Methods \nMethods for collecting data on benthic com- \nmunity structure are divided into three categories: \nprogram design, field methods, and laboratory \nmethods. Each of these categories is briefly \ndiscussed below. \nProgram design includes the selection of \nstation locations, level of replication, type of \nsampler, screen size, data analysis methods (dis- \ncussed later), and quality assurance/quality control \n(QA/Qc) procedures. The selection of station \nlocations will diredly influence the usefulness of \nthe resulting data. Stations that will be compared \nto one another (including reference stations) \nshould be situated in areas with similar hydro- \ngraphy, water depth, and grain size to minimize \nthe natural variability in benthic community \ncomposition that can be attributed to these factors. \nHowever, such station placement is not always \nattainable because of altered grain size distribu- \ntions that often result from contaminant sources. \nSelection of the number of replicates is an \nimportant component of program design because \n9-5 \nSediment Class;fic(lCiun Methods Compendium \nthe accuracy and precision with which benthic \ncommunity variables are estimated depend in part \non the size of the sample (including all replicates). \nFor example, the abundance of a single taxon is \ngenerally a less accurate descriptive variable than \nis the abundance of the total taxa because of the \ngreater variability typically associated with one \ntaxon in comparison with the sum of all taxa. \nThe total area sampled among the replicates at \neach station should be large enough to estimate a \ngiven variable within the limits of accuracy and \nprecision that are acceptable to meet study objec- \ntives. A single sample may be useful for general \ndistributional or trends analyses (Cuff and Cole- \nman, 1979), but the inherent patchiness of benthic \ncommunities makes collection of a sufficient \nnumber of replicate samples (a minimum of 3-5, \ndepending on study objectives and sampler area) \nnecessary to ensure statistical reliability (see \nElliott, 1977). Within a study area, adequate \nsample size may be determined by maximizing the \nnumber of species collected or by minimizing the \nerror associated with the mean for the variable in \nquestion (Gonor and Kemp, 1978). Additional \nresearch on replication is presently being conduct- \ned by EPA in Newport, Oregon, under the direc- \ntion of S. Ferraro (Swartz, R.C., 15 March 1989, \npersonal communication). \nPower analysis can assist in determining the \nappropriate number of replicates. A power analy- \nsis includes consideration of the minimum detect- \nable difference in selected biological variables \n(i.e., the minimum difference in mean values of a \nvariable at several stations that can be detected \nstatistically, given a certain level of variability \nabout those mean values) and the power of the \nstatistical test to be used. The power of the test is \nespecially important because it defines the proba- \nbility of correctly detecting experimental effects \n(e.g., differences in biological variables among \nsampling stations). For a specified variance \nassociated with a biological variable, the statistical \npower of a test and the minimum detectable \ndifference among sampling areas can be expressed \nas a function of sample size. The allocation of \nsampling resources (stations, replication, and \nfrequency) can then be determined with regard to \navailable resources, practicality of desigrr, and desired sensitivity of the subsequent analyses. \nDiscussions and examples of this approach are \nfound in Winer (1971), Saila et al. (1976), Cohen \n(1977), Moore and McLaughlin (1978); Bros and \n&well (1987), Ferraro et aI. (1989), Kronberg \n(1987), Tetra Tech (1987), Self and Mauri&en \n(1988), and Vezina (1988). \nA potential drawback to use of power analysis \nis that it requires aprbri knowledge of variability \nin the benthic communities that will be studied. \nIf such variability is not known and cannot be \nestimated, then the number of replicates will \nprobably reflect either funding limitations or \ngenerally approved sampling methods. For exam- \nple, Eleftheriou and Holme (1984) and Swartz \n(1978) recommend that an area of 0.5 m2 be \nsampled to assess species composition in coastal \nand estuarine regions. Most studies of benthic \ncommunity structure routinely involve five repli- \ncate 0.1-m* grab samples. A single 0.1-m* grab \nsample may be sufficient to obtain \u201cuseful descrip \ntive information\u201d for use in cluster analyses \n(Word, 1976). However, a single sample pre- \ncludes direct estimates of within-group variance \nfor statistical analyses. Because individuals are \ndistributed logarithmically among the species of a \nbenthic community (Preston, 1948; Sanders, 1968; \nGray and Mirza, 1979), species collected in the \nsecond and successive replicates that were not \ncollected in any of the previous replicates most \noften will be numerically \u201crare.\u201d Note that \u201crare\u201d \nis not synonymous with \u201cunimportant.\u201d Hence, a \nsingle 0.1-m\u2019 sample is generally not adequate to \ncharacterize benthic community structure and \nfunction. In general, five 0.1-m\u2019 grab samples are \nrecommended for determining benthic community \nstructure, unless evaluation of site-specific data \n(i.e., a power analysis) indicates that sufficient \nsensitivity can be obtained with fewer samples, or \nthat a greater number is required due to extreme \nspatial heterogeneity. (Note that at least three \nsamples are required for parametric statistical \nanalyses.) \nAnother aspect of program design is selection \nof the appropriate degree of navigational accuracy. \nFor baseline or distributional studies, repeatable \nstation location may not be a high priority, and \nmethods such as Loran C may be sufficient. \n9-6 \n9-Marine Benfhic Communify Stndure A-t \nHowever, for monitoring programs where reoccu- \npation of exact stations is important (e.g., disposal \nsite monitoring), a more accurate positioning \nmethod (e.g., an electronic distance-measuring \ndevice or Mini-Ranger) may be required. \nA quantitative sampling device and an appro- \npriate mesh size must be selected to ensure that \nsize classes of organisms appropriate for assessing \nsediment quality are collected. Selection of a \nsampler and sieve are discussed above, in Section \n9.2.1.2.1. \nField and laboratory methods must be con- \nducted according to rigorous QA/QC protocols. \nField methods include collecting, sieving, and \npreserving the samples. Samples are typically \npreserved in a solution of 10 percent buffered \nformalin for at least 24 h. Laboratory methods \ninclude rinsing the formalin solution from the \nsamples within 7-10 days, followed by storage in \n70 percent ethanol. Samples are sorted under a \ndissecting microscope during which all organisms \nare removed from the samples and placed in vials \nfor identification and enumeration of individual \ntaxa. \u2018Ihe time required to sort and identify a \nbenthic sample varies greatly depending on the \nsieve size, sample area, and sediment composition. \nSorting may take as little as 1 h for a 0.1-m* \nsample sieved through a l.O-mm screen, or as \nmuch as 12 h if wood chips or other debris are \npresent. The time needed to identify organisms in \na sample depends on the number of organisms \n(which is a function of sieve size, habitat, or \ndegree of contamination) and number of taxa \npresent. The number of hours needed to identify \norganisms in a sample may range from 1 to over \n10 b. \nIn addition to the collection of samples for \nanalysis of benthic community structure, separate \nsediment samples should be collected at all sta- \ntions for conventional sediment chemistry vari- \nables (e.g., sediment organic content, sediment \ngrain \u2018size distribution). Because organic carbon \ncontent and sediment grain size naturally affect \nthe composition of benthic communities, measure- \nment of these variables will assist in determining \nwhether benthic communities are affected by \nreduced sediment quality. 9.2.1.2.3 Types of Data Required \nThe two primary structural attributes of any \nbenthic community are the distribution of species \nand individuals in threedimensional space, and \nthe distribution of individuals among species and \nhigher taxa. Given an understanding of these two \nstructural attributes, it is possible to infer ftmdion- \nal.attributes of the benthic community, including \ntrophic relationships, primary and secondary \nproductivity, and interactions between the resident \nbioia and the abiotic habitat. l\u2019he data required \nfor analysis of the structural and functional at&ii \nutes include the number of taxa (identifications \nshould be to the lowest taxonomic level possible), \nthe abundance of each taxon, biomass (depending \non program objectives), and conventional sediment \nchemistry variables. However, collection of the \nappropriate data does not ensure proper evaluation \nof the structural and functional attributes. \u2018Ihe \nselection and implementation of data analyses are \nequally important, and are discussed in the re- \nmainder of this section. The data analyses pre- \nsented in this section address primarily structural \ncomponents of benthic communities. However, \nfunctional attributes can be inferred from many of \nthose structural attributes. \nVarious types of data analyses are used to \ndescribe benthic community structure, depending \non the objectives of the particular program \nHowever, several descriptive values are common \nto most program objectives. All organisms col- \nlected in each sample are enumerated (i.e., total \nabundance), and abundances of major taxonomic \ngroups are usually summarized. Depending on the \nlevel of identification, abundances of individual \ntaxa, numbers of taxa, and lists and abundances of \npollution-tolerant and pollution-sensitive taxa in \neach sample may be developed. Biomass of major \ntaxonomic groups and total biomass are sometimes \nreported. The composition of the numerically \ndominant taxa are analyzed when species level \nidentifications are performed. In addition, desaip- \ntive indexes such as diversity [the distribution of \nindividuals among species; see Washington (1984) \nfor additional definitions of diversity], eveuncgs \n(the evenness with which individuals are distribut- \ned among taxa), and dominance (the degree to \n9-7 St&rrerrt Classijicntion Methods Compendium \nwhich one or a few species dominate the commu- \nnity) are usually calculated. \nMost programs evaluate the temporal or \nspatial differences in benthic community structure. \nTypically, comparisons of one or more indexes are \nmade at the same station over time and compared \nto a baseline value, or comparisons are made \nbetween stations in a study area and stations in a \nreference area If an adequate number of samples \nis collected (i.e., three or more), statistical tests \nsuch as t-tests or Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) \n(or their nonparametric analogues) are often \nperformed to determine whether significant spatial \nor temporal differences exist among benthic \ncommunities. \nBesides univariate (i.e., single-variable) statis- \ntical analyses, multivariate (i.e., multiple-variable) \nanalyses are frequently performed (e.g., Boesch, \n1977; Green and Vascotto, 1978; Gauch, 1982; \nShin, 1982; Long and Lewis, 1987; lbanez and \nDauvin, 1988; Nemec and Brinkhurst, 1988a,b; \nStephenson and Ma&e, 1988). Multivariate \nanalyses include classification methods (i.e., \ngrouping similar stations into clusters) and ordina- \ntion methods [i.e., representing sample or species \nrelationships as faithfully as possible in a low- \ndimensional (two-four dimensions) space]. [See \nGauch (1982) for an overview of multivariate \nmethods. ] Multivariate techniques group data and \ndisplay them on a two-dimensional plot or dendro- \ngram so that stations exhibiting similar communi- \nties are located closer to one another than to \nstations with dissimilar communities. The numeri- \ncal and graphical results can then be compared \nwith physical and chemical data collected con- \ncurrently to determine whether those variables \ncorrelate with trends in benthic communities. A \ncommonly used classification technique involves \nfirst computing a matrix of similarity indexes that \nrepresent the degree of similarity in species com- \nposition between two stations. Commonly used \nsimilarity indexes include Bray-Curtis, Canberra \nmetric, and Euclidian distance indexes. The \nsimilarity matrix is then entered into a clustering \nalgorithm (e.g., pair-wise averaging, flexible \nsorting) to produce a dendrogram depicting simi- \nlarities among stations. Commonly used ordina- \ntion techniques include principal components analysis, detrended correspondence analysis, and \ndiscriminant function analysis. Bernstein and \nSmith (1986) developed an index of benthic \ncommunity change along pollution gradients that \nis derived from results of ordination analysis. The \nindex (called Index 5) is a measure of change \nfrom reference conditions. \nBenthic community surveys generate large \ndata matrices. These data matrices are often \nreduced by the elimination of certain species \n(Boesch, 1977) prior to performing multivariate \nanalyses. A variety of methods exist for reducing \ndata matrices (see Stephenson el of., 1970, 1972, \n1974; Day et al., 1971; Clifford and Stephenson, \n1975). \nBoth parametric statistical tests and multi- \nvariate analyses may involve data transformations. \nTransformations of the original data may be \nnecessary for one or more of tbe following rea- \nsons: \nn Benthic data sets are usually characterized \nby large abundances of a few species and \nsmall abundances of many species; \nn The distrrbution of individuals among \nspecies tends to be lognormal; and \nn Sampling effort may be inconsistent \n(Boesch, 1977). \nThe two basic types of transformations are strict \ntransformations and standardizations. S&id \ntransformations are alterations of the original \nvalues (e.g., species abundances) without reference \nto the range of values within the data. Commonly \nused transformations are square root, logarithmic, \nand arcsine (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981). Standardiza- \ntions are alterations that depend on some poperty \nof the data under consideration. A common stan- \ndardization is the conversion of values to percent- \nages. \nBenthic data are transformed to better meet \nthe assumptions of parametric tests (e.g., normali- \nty, homogeneity of variances). ln multivariate \nanalyses, data are often transformed using loga- \nrithms [e.g., log (x+1)] because of the presence of \nzero scores. This transformation is also applied \n9-8 \n9--Marine Benthic Community Structure Assessment \nwhen population variance estimates are positively \ncorrelated with mean values (Sokal and Rohlf, \n1981). Clifford and Stephenson (1975) discuss in \ndetail the effects of transformations on commonly \nused resemblance measures. \nBenthic community structure is usually com- \npared with chemical and physical data that are \ncollected concurrently. These comparisons may \ntake the form of simple linear correlations, corre- \nlations with cluster groups, or correlations using \nmultivariate techniques such as disaiminant \nanalyses. Multiple discriminant analysis attempts \nto isolate groups of similar stations so that viui- \nables responsible for the separation of groups can \nbe identified. Results may be used to determine \nwhether differences in community structure are \ndue to variations in sediment grain size, variations \nin other physical characteristics of the environ- \nment, or changes in sediment quality due to toxic \nsubstances or organic materials. \nThe use of different methods and analyses \nmay result in different interpretations of the same \ndata. For example, use of the same data with \ndifferent standardization methods in a classifica- \ntion analysis can yield very different results (Aus- \ntin and Grieg-Smith, 1968). Generally, the more \nanalyses that are conducted on the data, the higher \nthe probability of interpreting the data accurately. \n9.2.1.2.4 Necessary Hardware and Skills \nThe hardware needed to perform a benthic \ncommunity assessment is fairly common and \nshould be readily available. Equipment includes \nfield collection gear (e.g., sampling vessel, appro- \npriate sampler, sieves, sample storage containers, \nbuffered fixative) and standard biological laborato- \nry equipment (e.g., microscopes, sieves, hydrome- \nters or pipets, and a balance). More specialized \nequipment includes a muffle furnace for determin- \ning total volatile solids concentrations, a taxonom- \nic reference collection, and a taxonomic reference \nlibrary. Computer equipment and appropriate \nsoftware are required to make studies costeffec- \ntive. A microcomputer is sufficient for most \nanalyses, but some complicated multivariate \nanalyses may require the use of a minicomputer or \nmainframe computer. Trained benthic taxonomists are required to \nensure accurate identifications. Some computer \nprogramming and some level of data management \nare usually required. A trained benthic ecologist \nis required to synthesize and interpret the data. \nHowever, the amount of training depends on the \nrequired level of interpretation. For example, \ninterpretation of several multivariate methods \nwould require a higher level of training than inter- \npretation of descriptive indexes. \n9.2.1.3 A&quncy of Documentation \nMany different approaches and methods are \nused to analyze benthic data, some of which have \ntheir origins in classical terrestrial community \necology. Because analysis of benthic community \nstructure is a relatively old assessment tool, liter- \nally thousands of papers have been written about \nthe method. Several books and protocols have \nalso been developed to describe field and laborato- \nry techniques [e.g., Holme and McIntyre (1984), \nPuget Sound Protocols (Tetra Tech, 1986b), U.S. \nEPA 301(h) protocols (Tetra Tech, 1986a)]. \nHowever, a comprehensive document that de- \nscribes standardized procedures for analyzing and \ninterpreting benthic community data is lacking. \nThe most commonly used interpretive ap- \nproaches include measures of diversity and classi- \nfication. Sometimes a general consensus exists 011 \nthe best techniques to use within an approach \n(e.g., widespread use of Shannon-Wiener diversity \nindex, although there is debate as to whether this \nis a suitable index for environmental impad \nanalysis). Despite this consensus, studies do not \nnecessarily follow a specified format. Program \nobjectives tend to dictate the types of hypotheses \nposed and analyses used. Many relatively new and \nexciting approaches have been proposed for \nassessing benthic community structure. However, \nmost are relatively untested and are not widely \nused [e.g., benthic resource analysis technique \n(Latnz and Kendall, 1982), abundance-biomass \ncomparison (Warwick 1986; Warwick et 01, \n1987), infaunal trophic index (Word, 1978,1980), \naematode:copepod ratio (Amjad and Gray, 1983; \nLambshead, 1984; Shielis and Anderson, 1985; \nRaffaelli, 1987), lognormal distribution (Gray and \n9-9 \nSediment Classificdion Methods Compendium \nMirza, 1979), Index 5 (Bernstein and Smith, \n1986)]. Each of these methods has shown prom- \nise in some situations, but more testing and vali- \ndation are needed before any can gain universal \nacceptance. \nVery few assessments of the information \ngained from analyses of data at the species level \nvs. the major taxa level have been undertaken. \nWarwick (1988) evaluated the results of ordina- \ntions run on various hierarchical levels of taxo- \nnomic data for five data sets. Three of the data \nsets were of macrofauna (from Loch Linne, Clyde \nSea, and Bay of Morlaix); one was of nematodes \nfrom the Clyde Sea; and the last was of copepods \nfrom Oslofjord that were subjected to different \nlevels of particulate organic material. He reported \nthat in none of those five cases was there any \nsubstantial loss of information at the family level, \nand that in two cases the sample groupings related \nmore closely to the gradient of pollution at the \nphylum level than at the species level. Warwick \ntentatively suggested that \u201cantbropogenic effects \nmodify community composition at a higher taxo- \nnomic level than natural environmental variables, \nwhich influence the fauna more by species re- \nplacement.\u201d Warwick\u2019s paper appears to be the \nonly published work to support the use of higher \ntaxonomic groups for analysis purposes. In cases \nwhere only major taxa level data have been \ncollected (e.g., m and Tetra Tech, 1988), it has \nbeen difficult to determine differences in commu- \nnity structure between impacted areas and refer- \nence areas, and to establish causes of community \nalterations. Although it would be a cost-saving \napproach, use of higher taxonomic levels to assess \nbenthic communities is currently not an accepted \napproach in the United States. \n92.2 ApplicabiIity of Method to Human \nHealth, Aquatic Life, or Wildlife \nProtection \nThe assessment of benthic community struc- \nture is directly applicable to the protection of \naquatic life. Because benthic organisms are \naquatic, assessments of benthic community struc- \nture provide a direct measure of the condition of aquatic life. Furthermore, because bentbic organ- \nisms are consumed by other aquatic organisms \n(e.g., fish), assessing the condition of benthic \ncommunities provides information on other aquatic \norganisms. \nAssessment of benthic community structure is \nboth directly applicable to the protection of some \nwildlife (e.g., wading shorebirds that feed on the \nbenthic infauna) and indirectly applicable to the \nprotection of other wildlife (e.g., fisheating \nwildlife). A substantial decrease in abundance of \nbenthic organisms may result in the loss of food \nand a reduction in the value of certain habitat to \nwildlife. For example, distrtbutions of demersal \nfishes have been shown to be affected by changes \nin the composition of benthic infaunal communi- \nties (e.g., see Kleppel et al., 1980), as has the \ndistribution of the starfish Astiopecten vedi \n(Striplin, 1987). \nAssessment of benthic community structure \nmay be directly or indirectly applied to the protec- \ntion of human health. When changes in commu- \nnity structure are caused by the presence of toxic \ncontaminants, the bioaccumulation of those con- \ntaminants in more tolerant species may sometimes \nbe postulated. Those contaminated benthic in- \nfauna may directly affect human health if they are \ningested (e.g., shellfish contamination), or may \nindirectly affect human health if contaminants are \ntransferred through the food web to humans (e.g., \nconsumption of contaminated demersal ffih). \n9.2.3 Ability of Method to Generate \nNumerical Criteria for Specific \nChcmic8ls \nBenthic community structure as a stand- \nalone assessment method cannot presently \ngenerate numerical criteria for specific chemi- \ncals, nor is it likely that it will without extensive \nresearch. However, it is an integral component \nof other methods that generate numerical criteria \n(e.g., Apparent Effects Threshold, Sediment \nQuality Triad). ?he great number of factors \ninfluencing benthic community structure at a \ngiven site generally precludes isolation of chem- \nical-specific effects. \n9-IO \n9-4hine Benthic Community Structure Assessment \n93 USEFULNESS \nAssessment of benthic community structure \nhas become a valued tool for determining sedi- \nment quality. It is recognized as the only in sitar \nmeasure that provides information on changes in \necological relationships among species that inhabit \npotentially contaminated sediment. Its usefulness \nwill continue both as an assessment method on its \nown and as a component of other sediment quality \nassessment tools. \n93.1 Environmental Applicability \nThis method is applicable in a variety of \nenvironments. As a tool for assessing sediment \nquality, it has been used to asess the effects of \nknown or suspected contaminants (e.g., industrial \nor municipal discharges, oil spills). The results of \nsuch studies reveal the geographic extent of the \nproblem area and the type and severity of contam- \nination. \n9.3.1.1 S&ability for Different Sediment Tjpes \nBenthic community structure is well suited for \nassessing spatial and temporal effects of chemical \ncontamination and/or organic enrichment in a \nvariety of sediment types. However, to the extent \npossible, benthic communities occupying different \ntypes of sediment should not be compared. Con- \nsiderable research has shown that the structure of \nbenthic communities in coarse sediments differs \nfrom that in fine sediments (see Rhoads and \nYoung, 1970, Rhoads and Boyer, 1982). Briefly, \nspecies recruiting into soft, silty sediments must \nbe able to lolerate the deposition of fine particu- \nlate material. These environments tend to be \ninhabited by subsurface deposit-feeding organisms, \nwhereas sandy environments tend to be inhabited \nby both surface suspension-feeding species and \nsubsurface-dwelling species. Therefore, the \nexperimental design of a benthic survey must \nreflect that the functiona attributes of benthic \ncommunities in silty and sandy environments \nfundamentally differ. When reference stations are used as the basis \nfor determining differences in community stxudure \nbetween nonimpaded and potentially impacted \nstations, the reference and test stations should \nexhibit, to the extent possible, similar sediment \ncharacteristics (as well as similar water depths \nbecause benthic communities naturally vary by \ndepth). However, it is not always possible for the \nreference and test stations to have sediment that \nhas a similar composition; for example, dredged \nmaterial at a dump site may have different charac- \ntefistics than native sediment surrounding the \ndump site. If the experimental design is based on \nsampling the same stations through time to assess \ntemporal change, then presumably sediment grain \nsize would remain constant. If the objective is to \nsample along a potential gradient of chemical \ncontamination or organic enrichment, then all \nstations should have similar grain sizes and water \ndepths. However, this is not always possl%le \nbecause the source of contamination may alter the \nnatural grain size dist&ution of the sediments. \nBenthic community structure is also a suitable \ntechnique for assessing the presence of anaerobic \nsediments caused by poor flushing or excessive \norganic loading. The success of this approach will \nonce again hinge on comparing bentbic communi- \nty structure between stations with similar grain \nsizes and water depths. \n9.3.1.2 Suitability for Digerent Chemical or \nClasses of Chemicals \nAnalysis of benthic community structure is \nfrequently used to determine effects of chemicals \npresent in the sediment. However, it is not used \nas a method to quantify the relative concentrations \nof individual chemicals or classes of chemicals \npresent in sediment. Although individual species \nmay react to certain chemicals, these reactions are \nnot quantifiable at the community level. The \nApparent Effects Threshold approach (Chapter 10) \nincorporates changes in abundance of major taxa \nfor specific chemicals. \nBenthic communities respond predidably to \ngeneral categories of contamination. For example, \nmetals contamination of sediments results in \ndecreased species diversity (Rygg, 1985a, 198!%, \n9-11 \nSediment Chss$cation Methods Compendium \n1986). Organic enrichment, which leads to an \nincrease. in the food supply, generally results in \nincreased diversity and abundance at slight to \nmoderate levels of enrichment (Pearson and \nRosenberg, 1978; Rygg, 1986). However, beyond \nsome level of organic enrichment, diversity and \nabundance decrease with continued organic load- \ning (Pearson and Rosenberg, 1978). In an area \nreceiving both organic enrichment and toxic \ncontaminants, it may be difficult to distinguish the \neffects of these forms of pollution from each \nother. Additional research is greatly needed to \nhelp separate the effects of multiple sources of \ncontaminants. \n9.3.1.3 Suitability for Predicting Effects on \nDiflerent 0rganism.s \nChanges in benthic communities that result \nfrom the presence of organic enrichment or chemi- \ncal pollutants may be useful indicators of the \npotential effects of that pollution on predators of \nthe infauna (see Kleppel, 1982; Striplin, 1987). \nHowever, using benthic community structure to \npredict specific effects on potential predators (such \nas benthic-feeding fish or shorebirds) may be \ndifficult. Information on trophic relationships, \ncompetition, and predation is often not available. \nThe capability to predict the effects of altered prey \ncommunities on predators may improve with \nresearch on these topics. Factors such as food \nquality, distribution of food, interactions among \nspecies, and distribution of prey will all be impor- \ntant components of this research. \n9.3.1.4 Suitability for In-Place Pollutant \nControl \nBenthic community structure has not been \nused to set sediment quality goals or aiteria for \npolluted marine sediments. Benthic communities \nnaturally express sufficient spatial and temporal \nvariability to eliminate them from consideration as \na goal or criterion-setting variable. However, \nbenthic communities are an integral part of other \napproaches to assess sediment quality (see Chap- ters 10, and 11, and 12) in which benthic commu- \nnity stkcture k the only in situ biological \nsure. \n9.3.1.5 Suitabili~ for Source Control mea- \nBenthic community assessments can provide \nvaluable information for certain aspects of source \ncontrol. Benthic communities can assist the \nidentification of outfalls that discharge toxic \nchemicals or high organic loads. Depending on \nthe nature of tie material being discharged, ben- \nthic communilies may be diverse and abundant if \nthe material is organically enriched or may be \ndepauperate if the material has high levels of toxic \ncontaminants. Because benthic communities are \nnot currently useful for identifying specific chemi- \ncals or classes of chemicals present in the sedi- \nment, they are of limited value for identifying \nspecific sources of contaminants. \nFollowing the control of sources, benthic \ncommunity structure may be used to monitor long- \nterm recovery of the receiving environment (Tetra \nTech, 1988). It is not recommended as an indica- \ntor of the immediate effects of controlling sources \nbecause the sediment will remain contaminated \nuntil the sediment is actively remediated, or until \nbioturbation and natural deposition of uncon- \ntaminated particulates dilute the contaminated \nsediment. Furthermore, this assessment technique \nwould be useful only in areas where other uncon- \ntrolled sources would not obscure sediment recov- \ne-ry due to the controlled source. Where source \ncontrol has occurred, or is planned on a regional \nlevel, establishment of one or more stations for the \nanalysis of long-term trends in benthic community \nstructure is recommended as a method of monitor- \ning regional sediment recovery. The concentration \nand type of the contaminants and the hydrodynam- \nics of the study area will govern the length of \ntime over which recovery will occur (Pereg K, \n1 May 1989, personal communication). \n9.3.1.6 Suitability for Disposal Applications \nRegulations concerning biological testing of \nsediment that is dredged under sections 401 and \n9-12 \n9-h4arine Ben&c Communily Stnccture Assessment \n404 of the Clean Water Act do not include assess- \nments of benthic community structure. Benthic \ncommunities inhabit only the upper layers of \nsediment that will be dredged. Because sediment \nquality near the sediment surface may not reflect \nsediment quality throughout the depth of sediment \nto be dredged, benthic communities are unable to \nprovide information that is suitable for assessing \nthe entire volume of sediment that will be \ndredged. memica analyses, laboratory bioassays, \nand bioaccumulation studies can, however, be \nused to assess sediment quality throughout the \ndredging depth. Section 102 of the Marine Pro- \ntection Research and Sanctuary Act does call for \nmonitoring of benthic community structure in \nareas where dredged material is disposed. \nThe International Joint Commission (IJC) \nrecommends use of benthic communities to deter- \nmine whether areas of concern exist in sediments \nthat require dredging (IJC, 1988a, 1988b). How- \never, they do not discuss whether benthic commu- \nnity structure would be used to determine the suit- \nability of dredged material for open-water dis- \nposal. \nAnalysis of benthic community structure is \nappropriate for postdisposal monitoring of cun- \nfined and unconfined disposal sites and for moni- \ntoring recovery of areas that were dredged. As \npart of the Puget Sound Dredged Disposal Analy- \nsis (PSDDA) postdisposal monitoring program, \nbenthic community structure is used to monitor \nthe potential transport of disposed material away \nfrom the disposal site (SAIC, 1991; Striplin et al., \n1991). The purpose of this aspect of the monitor- \ning program is to determine whether benthic \ncommunities are altered near the disposal site and, \nif so, whether the changes are due to offsite \nmigration of the disposed material. Benthic \ncommunity structure was also incorporated into \nthe proposed monitoring program for confined \naquatic disposal sites to confirm recolonization of \nthe clean sediment cap and to monitor cap integ- \nrity at the Commencement Bay Near&ore/ \nTideflats Superfund site in Tacoma, Washington \n(Tetra Tech, 1988). As described earlier, Swartz \net al. (1980) documented recovery in Yaquina \nBay, Oregon, following dredging. Rhoads et al. (1978) suggested that periodic disturbance such as \ndredging and disposal may enhance benthic \nproductivity. \n93.2 General Advantages and Limitations \nGeneral advantages of using benthic commu- \nnity structure to determine sediment quality \ninclude its inberent capability to provide aa \necological basis for evaluation of sediment quality. \nIt is an empirical rather than a theorekal ap- \nproach. However, as with most assessm ent tech- \nniques involving field studies, the evaluation of \nbenthic communities is costly and time-consum- \ning. The information gained is often not suitable \nfor specific management decisions because of the \nlack of numerical management criteria and the \nmethod\u2019s inability to identify specific chemicals \nresponsible for an impact. However, the tech- \nnique has been incorporated into other predictive \ntechniques (see Chapters 10, 11, and 12) that \nprovide information more easily used by resource \nmanagers. \n9.3.2.1 Ease of Use \nAssessments of benthic community structure \nrequire field collections, extensive laboratory \nwork, and data analysis and interpretation by \ntrained benthic ecologists. It is difficult to argue \nthat the method is easy to use, especially in \ncomparison to other methods that rely on estab- \nlished criteria. However, the use of bent& \ncommunity structure as a sediment quality assess- \nment tool is widely accepted, and trained bent& \necologists are available throughout the country. \nBy using highly experienced individuals to am- \nduct the field, laboratory, and data analysis work, \npotential problems (such as generating \u201cnoisy\u201d \ndata that obscure real trends, or arriving at differ- \nent interpretations using the same data) should not \noccur. \n9.3.2.2 Reldive Cost \nThe relative cost of conducting an assessmat \nof benthic communities is less than the cost to \n9-13 \nSediment CIass+cafion Methods Compendium \ndevelop and implement other sediment quality \nassessment techniques such as the Apparent \nEffects Threshold and equilibrium partitioning \napproaches. However, once sediment quality \nvalues have been generated, the relative cost of \nconducting a benthic survey is greater than the \ncost of analyzing sediment for contaminant con- \ncentrations and comparing those data to the values \nto determine sediment quality. Sediment toxicity \nbioassays are generally less costly than analysis of \nreplicated benthic samples. Because the Triad \napproach requires synoptic analyses of sediment \nchemistry, sediment toxicity, and benthic commu- \nnities, it is more costly to implement than simply \nan analysis of benthic communities. It also \nprovides broader information from which to \ndetermine sediment quality. \nThe objectives of benthic community assess- \nment programs strongly influence cost by dictating \nthe number of stations and number of replicates \nper station. The cost per replicate is relatively \nhigh (i.e., S400-S 1 ,OOO), but varies greatly depend- \ning on the size of the area sampled, the screen \nsize, the level of the taxonomic identifications, \nand the environment sampled. \n9.3.2.3 Tendency to Be Conservative \nBenthic community strudure is a moderately \nconservative measure of sediment quality. Be- \ncause benthic community structure reflects the \ncollective response of all species, responses of \nindividual species that are susceptible to degrada- \ntion in sediment quality may not be obvious at the \ncommunity level because of the lack of response \nin olher species that are more tolerant of environ- \nmental degradation. Changes to numerous species \nor dominant species must occur before changes at \nthe community level are evident. If assessments \nof sediment quality were made using individual \nspecies instead of communities, they could be \neither conservative by relying on sensitive species \nor not conservative by relying on tolerant species. \n9.3.2.4 Level of Acceptance \nBenthic community assessments have been \nused as a sediment quality assessment tool for several decades in North America, Europe, and \nAustralia, as well as in South Africa, China, and \nJapan. The method has gained widespread accep- \ntance because of its inherent capability to assess \nsediment quality at the community level, thereby \ndocumenting ecological response to sediment \nperturbations. \nMany me&ds may be used to analyze ben- \nthic community data, as discussed above. Some \nof these methods have gained far wider acceptance \nthan have other, sometimes newer, approaches. \nThe most widely accepted types of analyses \ninclude measures of abundance, numbers of taxa, \ndiversity, similarity, community classification, and \nthe abundance of sensitive and tolerant species. \nOther analytical methods include the log-normal \ndistribution (Gray and Mizra, 1979), the use of \nmajor taxa instead of species-level data (Warwick, \n19@3), and the Infaunal Trophic Index (Word, \n1978, 1980). Each of these may be appropriate \nfor certain types of perturbations, but have yet to \ngain widespread acceptance. \n9.3.2.5 Ability to Be Implemented by \nLaboratories with l)pkal Equipment \nand Handling Facilities \nMany laboratories either have the essential \nequipment for conducting benthic community \nsurveys or can readily obtain this equipment. \nHowever, locating qualified taxonomists to over- \nsee the sorting and to identify the organisms may \nbe difficult. Taxonomists require several years of \ntraining and experience before they are considered \nexperts in their respective taxonomic fields. They \nalso require access to a reference museum of \nverified organisms to assist in their identifications. \nA thorough taxonomic library containing original \ndescriptions of species is also an integral compo- \nnent of taxonomic laboratories. \n93.2.6 Level of Efort Required to Generate \nRest& \nThe level of effort required to conduct a \nbenthic community survey is dependent on the \nobjectives of the program, which may affect the \nnumber of stations, number of replicates per sta- \n9-14 \n9-Mminc Benthic Community Stnrcture A-t \ntion, taxonomic level of the identifications, and \ndata analysis procedures. Regardless of those \nobjectives, a field effort is required; the samples \nmust be sorted, identified, and enumerated; and \nthe resulting data must be analyzed. This process \ntypically requires several months, but it is not \nunusual for it to require a full year for a very \nlarge sampling effort, or for a program in which \nthe samples require large sorting or identification \ntimes. For example, the sorting time for samples \ncollected from deep water silt and clay may be \nl-2 h, whereas that for samples from shallow \nsandy sites might be 4-6 h because shallow sandy \nareas typically contain more abiotic material. If \nwood chips are present in the sample, then the \nsorting time can easily exceed 12 h, depending on \nthe volume of wood chips. \n9.3.2.7 Degree to Wkh Results Lend \nThemselves to Interpretation \nThe interpretation of benthic community data \nrequires an expert who is familiar with the natural \nhistory of the fauna and the statistical techniques \nthat are routinely used to analyze the data. Inter- \npretation of the many data points generated by this \napproach may require many weeks before mean- \ningful trends are recognized. \u2018Ihe inherent vari- \nability of benthic communities has so far prevent- \ned the development of specific benthic criteria for \nuse in assessing pollutant-related trends in sedi- \nment quality. \n9.3.2.8 Degree of Environmental Applicability \nThe assessment of benthic community struc- \nture is a direct measure of the environmental \neffects of pollutants and, as such, is highly appli- \ncable as a method to assess sediment quality. Its \napplicability lies in its ability to provide inforrna- \ntion on the effects of pollutants on ecological \nprocesses within the sedimentary environment. \n9.3.2.9 Degree of Accuracy and Precision \nProvided that sufficient funding is available to \ncollect and process the necessary numbers of replicate samples, analysis of benthic community \nstructure is accurate {defined as how well the data \nrepresent true field conditions) and precise (de- \nfied as the consistency and reliability of the \nsamples). The resulting data are obtained directly. \nfrom the populations under study. Other sediment \nquality assessment methods descrtbed in this \ncompendium are not direct measures of field \nconditions and therefore are less likely to be as \naccurate and precise. \nMany factors in the design of a benthic com- \nmunity survey directly influence the degree of \naccuracy and precision of the resulting data. \nThese factors include station placement, number of \nreplicates, appropriateness of reference areas, \nsampler, sieve mesh size, sampling interval, \nquality of taxonomy, and the type and quality of \nthe data analysis. The best way to ensure high \ndegrees of accuracy and precision is to conduct a \npilot study in the ares of interest prior to design- \ning a major field survey. The pilot survey will \nprovide information on variability within benthic \ncommunities, which then directly affects the \nrequired number of replicates and station place- \nment. lhe analysis of data from a pilot study \nmay also help generate different hypotheses that \nmay alter the sampling and analysis plans to better \ndefine the communities. \n9.4 S\u2019l\u2019AlWS \nMany methods to assess sediment quality rely \non benthic community structure as a measure of \npotential ecological effects of pollutants. Benthic \ncommunity structure has been incorporated into \nprograms with vastly different objectives because \nthe resident biota are sensitive indicators of many \nkinds of environmental perturbations. Aspects of \nthe status of benthic community structure as a \nsediment quality assessment tool are discussed in \nthis section. \n9.d.l Extent of Use \nAssessment of benthic community structure \nhas been a valued tool in marine, estuarine, and \n9-15 \nSediment CZassz+x~tiun Methods Compendium \nfreshwater environments for several decades. \nMany of the early programs examined benthic \ncommunities from an academic viewpoint. Since \nthe 197Os, benthic community structure has been \nused as a measure of sediment quality. Since then \nthis method has been used to determine the effects \nof municipal effluents, industrial discharges, \neutrophication, organic enrichment, oil spills, and \nmine tailings disposal (see Section 9.1.1). It has \nalso been used to determine the suitability of \nsediments for dredged material disposal, to moni- \ntor dredged material disposal sites, and to monitor \nrecovery of impacted areas following the cessation \nof contaminant loading. \n9.4.2 Extent to Wbicb Approach Has Been \nField-Validated \nBecause benthic community structure is an in \nsitu sediment quality assessment tool, it does not \nrequire additional field validation. \n9.43 Reasons for Llmlted Use \nAlthough conducting studies of bentbic com- \nmunity structure is a common practice, the cost \nand amount of time required to generate usable \nresults may prevent the method from being imple- \nmented by all who could benefit from its use. In \nfact, the method has been deleted from some \nprograms due solely to cost (Bilyard, 1987). In \nsome situations, costs and time have been reduced \nby taking the identifications only to tbe major \ntaxonomic level. This reduction of taxonomic \ndetail frequently reduces the usefulness of the \ninformation (Warwick, 1988), wbicb exacerbates \na perception by some resource managers that the \ndata are too variable to be useful. Detecting \ntrends within benthic data is not a simple process. \nHowever, the proper design and implementation of \na field survey will radically increase the probabi- \nlity of producing valuable data and results. \n9.4.4 Outlook for Future Use and Amount of \nDevelopment Yet Needed \nThe outlook for the future use of benthic \ncommunity structure as a sediment quality assess- ment tool is particularly bright because of the \ncontinuing development of new data analysis \nmethods by researchers in North America and \nEurope. The objective of these methods is gener- \nally to reduce cost or variability within the data by \nrelating aspects of the distributions of organisms \nor organism biomass to specific kinds of environ- \nmental perturbations. Gray and Mirza (1979) \ndetermined that the lognormal distribution of \ntidividuals was altered in a predictable manner in \nthe presence of slight organic pollution. A more \nrecent method for detecting pollution effects on \nmarine bentbic communities is the species abun- \ndance/biomass comparison (ABC) method devel- \noped by Warwick (1986). This method proposes \nthat the relationship between the number of \nindividuals among species and the distribution of \nbiomass among species changes in a predictable \nmanner in the presence of organic pollution. \nBeukema (1988) evaluated the ABC method in an \nintertidal habitat in the Dutch Wadden Sea and \ndetermined that the method \u201ccannot be applied to \ntidal flat communities without reference to long- \nterm and spatial series of control samples.\u201d Yet \nanother benthic community assessment method \nthat remains under development is the Infaunal \nTrophic Index proposed by Word (1978, 1980). \nThat method is based on changes in the feeding \necology of benthic infauna in relation to organic \nenrichment. \u2018Ibe Benthic Resource Assessment \nTechnique, developed by Lunz and Kendall \n(1982), quantifies the effects of changes in benthic \ncommunities on fish resources. Although the \nBRAT technique is not a direct assessment of \nbenthic community stTUcture, it provides important \ninformation on the relationships among benthic \ncommunities and higher level predators, and \ndescribes how those relationships may &ange in \nthe presence of pollutants. \nA radically different approach to interpreting \nlong-term changes in benthic community structure \ninvolves use of a se&men1 profile camera. Rho- \nads and German0 (1986) developed the RE- \nMOT!% (remote ecological mapping of the sea- \nfloor) system. \u2018I%ey use a vessel-deployed sedi- \nment-profile camera to photograph vertical sec- \ntions of the sediment, Although REMOTSS \n9-16 \n9\u201dAurinc Benthic Community Structure Assessment \ncannot determine the species composition of the \nbenthic community, it can document relationships \nbetween organisms and sediment. Rhoads and \nGetmano (1986) characterized the successional \nstages of benthic communities and suggested that \nmapping these stages will permit the detection of \nchanges in benthic communities. When this \ninformation is collected as part of a preliminary \nsurvey, it can be used to assist in the design of a \ncost-efficient benthic community survey for \nobtaining geochemical and biological information. \nAdditional research is needed on some funda- \nmental aspects of benthic community assessment. \nThese include the development of guidelines for \nthe identification of reference sites or reference \nvalues and additional studies into the usefulness of \nidentifying infauna to various taxonomic levels. \nU.S. EPA is presently examining some aspects of \nthese questions through the Clean Water Act \nsection 301(h) program, including examination of \nthe degree of variability in benthic communities in \ncontaminated and reference areas, development of \na quantitative definition of \u201cbalanced indigenous \npopulations,\u201d and assessment of the effects of \noverlapping contaminant sources on benthic \ninfaunal communities. \nThe sediment profile camera has been used for \na variety of other purposes including assessing the \nrelationships between sediment quality and eutro- \nphication (Day ef al., 1987; Revelas ef al., 1987; \nRhoads, D.C., 1 May 1989, personal communica- \ntion), monitoring the perimeter of dredged materi- \nal disposal sites (Rhoads, D.C., 1 May 1989, \npersonal communication; Diaz, RJ., 1 May 1989, \npersonal communication), and evaluating the \noverwintering habitat of blue crabs in Chesapeake \nBay (Schaffner and Diaz, 1988). With further \nresearch, the sediment profile camera may be used \nfor other applications concerning aspects of \nbenthic community structure and sediment quality. \n9.5 REFERENCES \nAmjad, S., and J.S.

It typically incorporates measures of \nsediment chemistry, sediment toxicity, and benthic \ninfauna communities, although other variables can \nbe used. This combination method is both de- \nscriptive and numeric. It is most commonly used \nto describe sediment qualitatively, but has also \nbeen used to generate chemical-specific sediment \nquality criteria (Chapman, 1986, 1989; Long, \n1989). One application of the Triad approach, the \nApparent Effects Threshold (AET), is described in \ndetail in the following chapter (Chapter 11). \n10.1 SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS \n10.1.1 Current Use \nThe Triad approach can be used to determine \nthe extent of pollution-induced degradation of \nsediments in a non-numerical, multiple-chemical \nmode (e.g. Chapman et al., 1986, 1987a, 1991a; \nChapman and Power, 1990; Chapman, 1990). It \ncan also be used to determine numerical sediment \nquality criteria directly (e.g. Chapman, 1986, \n1989) and, through manipulations, to determine \nAET values (see Chapter 11). \nThe AET is only one possible method of \nevaluating triad data and is directed solely at \ndetermining numeric sediment quality values \n(Chapman et al., 1991b, 1991c). The triad ap- \nproach has been used in marine coastal waters on \nthe west coast of North America (e.g., Puget \nSound, San Francisco Bay, and Vancouver Harbor, \nCanada), in the Gulf of Mexico, in freshwater \nenvironments including the Great Lakes, and in \nthe North Sea (Long and Chapman, 1985; chap- \nman, in press; Chapman et al., 1986, 1987a, in \npress; Chapman and Power, 1990, Cross et al., \n1991, in review). Current uses of the Triad approach are summarized in Table 10-1 and \ndiscussed in Section 10.3.1, Environmental \nApplicability. \n10.1.2 Potential use \nThe Sediment Quality Triad approach can also \nbe used to meet the following objectives: \n\u2022 To identify problem areas of sediment \ncontamination where pollution-induced \ndegradation is occurring; \n\u2022 To prioritize and rank degraded areas and \ntheir environmental significance; and \n\u2022 To predict where such degradation will \noccur based on levels of contamination \nand toxicity. \nThe Triad approach can be used in any num- \nber of situations and is not restricted to aquatic \nsediments. For example, it can be used in water \ncolumn work with phytoplankton and in terrestrial \nhazardous waste dump studies with other organ- \nisms of concern. Other uses are described in \nSection 10.3.1. A complete description of the \nTriad in the context of integrated assessments is \nprovided in Chapman et al., 1991b. \n10.2 DESCRIPTION \n10.2.1 Description of Method \nThe Triad approach consists of three com- \nportents (Figure 10-1): \n\u2022 Sediment chemistry--to measure chemical \ncontamination; Sediment Classification Methods Compendium \nTable 10-1. Current Uses of the Sediment Quality Triad Approach. \nPS = Puget Sound, various locations (Long and Chapman, 1985). \nGM= Gulf of Mexico, oil platform (Chapman et al., 1991a; Chapman and Power, 1990). \nSF = San Francisco Bay, various locations (Chapman et al., l986, l987a). \nVH = Vancouver Harbor. Canada, various locations (Chapman et al., 1989; Cross et al, 1991; Cross et al; in \nreview). \nFW = Various freshwater environments (Malueg et al., 1984; Chapman unpublished data; Rogers. North Texas \nState, unpublished data; Wiederholm et al., 1987). \nNS = North Sea (Chapman, In press; Chapman et al, in press). \n\u2022 Sediment bioassays-to measure toxicity; \n\u2022 In situ biological variables - to measure \nin situ alteration (e.g., a change in benthic \ncommunity structure). \nThe three components provide complementary \ndata. No single component of the Triad approach \ncan be used to predict the measurements of the \nother components. For instance, sediment chemis- \ntry provides information on contamination but not \non biological effects. Sediment bioassays provide \ndirect evidence of sediment toxicity. However, \nthe laboratory conditions under which bioassays \nare conducted may not accurately reflect field \nconditions of exposure to toxic chemicals. In situ \nalteration of resident biota measured by infauna \ncommunity analyses provides direct evidence of \ncontaminant-related effects in the environment, but \nonly if confounding effects not related to pollution \n(e.g., competition, predation, recruitment cycles, \nsediment type, salinity, temperature, recent dredg- ing) can be excluded. In particular, because the \ntoxicity of a chemical substance in sediments may \nvary with its concentration and with the conditions \nwithin a specific sediment, the importance of any \nparticular concentration of a chemical or suite of \nchemicals in sediments cannot be determined \nsolely from chemical measurements. Sediment \nconditions include grain size, organic content, pH, \nEh, chemical form, and presence of other \nchemicals. \nThe three components of the Triad approach \nintegrate chemical and biological response data. \nThey also provide the strongest evidence for \nidentifying pollution-induced degradation. For \ninstance, if there are high levels of sediment \ncontamination, toxicity, and biological alteration, \nthe burden of evidence indicates degradation. \nConversely, low levels of sediment contamination, \ntoxicity, and biological alteration indicate non- \ndegraded conditions. Conclusions that can be \ndrawn from intermediate responses are listed in \nTable 10-2. \n10-2 \nI&Triad Approach \nSEDIMENT CHEMISTRY \nFigure 10-l. Conceptual Model of the Sediment Quality Triad. \nThe Triad combines data from chemistry, toxicity bioassays, and in situ studies. Chemistry and \nbioassay estimates are based on laboratory measurements with field-wkcted sediments. In situ \nstudies generally include, but are not limited to, measures of benthic community structure. Areas \nwhere the three facets of the Triad show the greatest overlap (in terms of either positive 01 \nnegative results) provide the strongest \u2018data for determining sediment quality criteria. \n10.2.1.1 Objectives and Assrunprions \nThe objectives of tie Triad approach are to \nindependently measure sediment contamination, \nsediment toxicity, and biological alteration, and \nthen use the burden of evidence to assess sediment \nquality based on all three sets of measurements. \nThe following assumptions apply: \nn The approach allows for (1) the interac- \ntions between contaminants in complex \nsediment mixtures (e.g., additivity, antag- \nonism, synergism); (2) the adions of \nunidentified toxic chemicals; and (3) the effect of environmental faders that influ- \nence biological responses (including toxi- \ncant concentrations). \nm Selected chemical contaminant concentra- \ntions are appropriate indicators of overall \nchemical contamination. \nH Bioassay test results and values of select- \ned benthic community structure variables \nare appropriate indicators of biological \neffects. \nTbe.se components are presently often treated \nin an additive manner, with each having equal \n103 \nSediment Clnssfktion Methuds Compendium \nTable l&2.

Sediments for analysis \nof toxicity should come from the same cornposited \nhomogenate, as originally detailed by Chapman \n(1988), ideally from field ralher than solely labor- \natory test replicates. Benthic infauna samples \nshould be collected- at the same sampling loca- \ntions. Chemistry and bioassay sediments are \ncollected (usually by remote grab), transferred to \na solvent-rinsed glass or stainless steel bowl, and \nthoroughly homogenized by stirring with a glass \nor stainless steel spatula until textural and color \nhomogeneity are achieved. The homogenized \nsediments are then placed in appropriate sampling \ncontainer% In generat, chemistry and bioassay \nsamples should include field rather than laboratory \nreplication. Benthic infaunal samples are collected \nat the same location. In the absence of initial sampling to determine the optimum level of \nreplication at a site, five field replicate benthic \nsamples are recommended per station (see aapter \n8, Methods). Coincident rather than synoptic \nsampling is possrble (e.g., Long and Chapman, \n1985); however, spatial heterogeneity ln sediment \ncontamination and toxicity make such data diffr- \ncult to interpret (Swark d al., 1982). \nAdequate quality QA/QC measures must be \nfollowed in all aspects of the study, from field \nsampling through laboratory analyses and data \nentry. Detailed QA/QC procedures are available \nthrough international (e.g., Keith cf al., 1983) and \nregional publications (e.g., Terra Tech, 1986a). \nThe first component of the Triad invoIves \nidentification and quantification of inorganic and \norganic contaminants present in the sediments. \naiemical analytes measured are generally re- \nstricted by quipmeat, technology, and the avail- \nability of funds and facilities. IALA concerns and \nexisting data also affect target analytes measured. \nCost, if a factor, must be balanced against the \nneed for an analytical database sufficiently large \n104 \nlo-Triad Approach \nTable 10-3.

For logistical reasons, a small number \nof bioassays is conducted to cover as wide a range \nas possible of organism type, life cycle, exposure \nroute, and feeding type. The number of tests \nundertaken is affected by the same constraints as \nthose mentioned for sediment chemistry analyses. \nPossible static sediment bioassays that provide \na reasonable characterization of the degree of \ntoxicity are shown in Table 10-4. Obvious omis- sions from this list include full life-cycle chronic \ntests, and genotoxic or cytotoxic response tests. \nSuch tests merit consideration for inclusion when \nproven accepted methods become available (e.g., \nUng and Buchman, 1989). \nThe final Triad component involves the \nevaluation of in sihr biological alteration. Gener- \nally, this component is provided by benthic in- \nfauna community data because benthic organisms \nare relatively sessile and location-specific. Hist+ \npathology of bottom fish has also been used for \nthis Triad component (Chapman, 1986), but for \nareawide rather than site-specific studies, because \nthese fish are relatively mobile. Several variables \nin combination are effective in characterizing \nbenthic community structure for the Triad \napproach: numbers of taxa, numerical dominance, \nIO-6 \nlo-Triad Appmch \ntotal abundance, and percentage composition of \nmajor taxonomic groups. In the marine environ- \nment, this last category includes any or all of \npolychaetes, amphipods, molluscs, and echino- \nderms. In the freshwater environment, oligo- \ncbaetes, chironomids, and other major insect \ngroups would fit into the last category. \nSediment chemistry, toxicity, and benthic \ninfauna data are combined in the Triad approach \nto asses the degree of degradation of each station \nand of each site (see Figure 10-l). All data are \ncompared on a quantitative basis and can be \nnormalized to reference site values by converting \nthem to ratio-to-reference (RTR) values as de- \nscribed by Chapman et al. (1986, 1987a) and \nChapman (1990). The reference site chosen \n(either u priori or a posteriori) is generally the \nleast contaminated site of those sampled, and \nideally its sediment and other characteristics (e.g., \nwater depth) would be similar to those of the \nother sites. To determine RTR values, the values \nof specific variables (e.g., normalized concentra- \ntion of a particular metal, percent mortality in a \nparticular bioassay, number of taxa) are divided by \nthe corresponding reference values. This process \nnormalizes the data so that they can be compared \neven when, for instance, there are large differences \nin the units of measurement. The reference site \nmay be a single station (whose RTR value is 1.0 \nby definition) or an area containing several sta- \ntions for which data are averaged. \nThe RTR criterion is based but does not \ndepend on the assumption that the reference site \nconcentrations are indicative of reference or \nbackground conditions. The degree to which \nchemical concentrations are elevated above the \nmean reference concentrations at a selected site is \nused as the criterion for selecting chemicals most \nlikely to be anthropogenically enriched and of \nconcern. An index of contamination can be \ncalculated for each station by separately determin- \ning RTR values for groups of similar chemicals \n(e.g., metals, PAH, chlorinated organ&) and then, \nassuming additivity, combining these values as a \nsingle mean chemistry RTR value. Similarly, an \nindex of toxicity can be calculated by combining \nbioassay RTR values as a single mean value. \nFinally, an index of biological alteration can be calculated in the same manner as is toxicity, using \nbenthic community structure data. The indexes of \ncontamination can be used to rank stations. These \nsummary ranks can also be compared with the \nranks generated using the sediment bioassay and \ninfaunal data. \nThe composite RTR values for each Triad \ncomponent can also provide useful visual indexes. \nThese values can be plotted on scales with a \ncommon origin and placed at 120 degrees from \neach other such that each of the three values \nbecomes the vertex of a triangle. The relative \ndegree of degradation is derived by calculating \nand comparing the areas of the triangles for each \nstation or site. Examples of such triaxial plots are \nshown in Figure 10-2, for the eight possible situa- \ntions shown in Table 10-2. These plots also \nprovide a visual guide to the characteristics of \nbackground or reference stations. Because refer- \nence data usually involve a site containing more \nthan one reference station, RTR comparisons \nshould also be made against individual reference \nstations. Alden (1992) provides a method for \ndetermining confidence limits for such triaxial \nplots. Non-RTR methods of Triad data anabsis \nare outlined in Section 10.2.1.2.3, Types of Data \nRequired. \n10.2.1.2.1 Type of Sampling Required \nAs described, synoptic sampling is preferred \nfor all three Triad components. Any reasonable \nsampling procedure can be used if it provides \nsuitable sediment samples for quantifying sedi- \nment contamination, toxicity, and biological \nalteration. To date, studies have used remote \nsamplers such as a 0.1-m\u2019 Van Veen grab operated \nfrom a vessel. \n10.2.1.2.2 Methods \nTypical variables included in the chemical \nanalyses and sediment bioassays are listed in \nTables 10-3 and 10-4, respectively.

These \nmeasurements can then be combined, as described \nabove. Detailed data calculations and analyses are \nas folIows: \nData Calculations - Benthic Data \nn Calculate/determine endpoints \nl taxa richness \nl total abundance \nl numerical dominance \nl species diversity \nl mean abundances of all species of ma- \njor taxa (e.g. polychaetes, amphipods, \nchironomids, oligochaetes) \nn Cluster Analysis \nl e.g., using mean numbers of individuals \nper taxa present at each station tested. \nData Calcuiatbns - Chemistry \nn Bulk concentration normalized to dry \nweight \nn Organic carbon normalized concentration \nof organic compounds \nn Normalize to percent fines, sand, silt, and \nclay \nw AVS normalized concentration of metals \n(DiToro et al., 1990; Dewitt et al., 1990) \nm Summarize means, standard deviations, \nranges for each parameter at each site. \nData Calculations - Bioassay \nI Between station differences in mean re- \nsponse, ANOVA, multiple comparison \nkStS. l Paired comparison with control response. \nn Comparison of mean response with lower \nprediction limit (LPL) (Dewitt et al., \n1988); this comparison addresses possible \ngrain-size effects on amphipods. \nNon-RTR Methoa!s of Triad Data Analysis \nThe traditional reduction technique of calculat- \ning RTRs (by translating m&ant measures to \nproportions of comparable values obtained for the \nreference site) has the following problems (Cross \net al., 1991; Cross et al., in review): \nn Substantial loss of information during the \nconversion of multivariate data into single \nproportional indexes; \nn Loss of any spatial relational information; \nn Inability to statically assess significance \nof spatial impacts; and \nl Requirement of an appropriate reference \nstation. \nXn addition, Triad results could be strongly \ninfluenced by the presence of unmeasured toxic \ncontaminants that may or may not covary with \nmeasured chemicals (Chapman, 1990). The RTR \napproach is useful in specific situations and with \ndefined limitations; however, the following op- \ntions are useful for reducing or removing the \nproblems identified. \nRanking-In addition to RTRs, rankings can also \nbe assigned to biological, chemical, and toxicolog- \nical data for statistical comparisons of the data. \nUsing the chemistry data as an example, the \nsample with the lowest level of a chemical is \nscored as 1 and the highest is scored with a \nnumber that is equal to the number of time peri- \nods or samples that are to be ranked. Tied data \nshould be scored by calculating an average of the \ntied ranks. Each site will have a rank for each \nbiological, chemical, and toxicological parameter. \nAn overall mean rank for each site can be cah- \nlo-9 \nSt&men t Classijicn tion Methods Compendium \nlated using each of the parameters. This effective- \nly determines how each site compares to each of \nthe other sites. \nAverage ranks for biological, chemical, and \ntoxicological data can also be calculated and can \nbe compared using Kendall\u2019s coefficient of con- \ncordance (Zar, 1984). High concordance will \nindicate that biological, chemical, and toxicologi- \ncal parameters are changing in the same direction \n(improving or degrading). Low concordance will \nindicate that biological, chemical, toxicological \ndata are changing independently of each other. \nMultivariate Analysis-Multivariate analysis \ncomprises data matrix preparation, analysis inde- \npendent of the Triad components, analysis concur- \nrent with the Triad components, and Mantel\u2019s test. \nEach of these is briefly described here. \nData Matrix Preparation \nFor each Triad component, data are standard- \nized to common units where possible and incorpo- \nrated into separate matrices for analysis and \ninterpretation. \nBen thos: Data are abundance of each taxon \nper grab sample; transformed to log \n(x+1). \nChemistry: Values less than the detection limit \nare omitted to maintain the integrity \nof the matrix. Remaining data are \nlog-transformed. \nBioassay: Because of the number of indepen- \ndent bioassays and differing end- \npoints (e.g., mortality, avoidance, \nreburial, etc.), these data cannot be \nstandardized to common internal \nunits. Various transformations \n(arsine square root, log, etc.) may \nbe used as required. \nIndependent AM~J.JS~S of the Triad Components \nEach matrix is analyzed separately to deter- \nmine environmental impact as provided by each independent approach. Community classification \nanalysis may be performed for each data matrix \nusing cluster analysis. \u201cBoot-strapping\u201d tech- \nniques developed by Nemec and Brinkhurst \n(1988a, 1988b) can be used to test whether clus- \nters of samples differ significantly from each \nother. \nConcurrent A~lysis of the Triad Corqwments \nThe ecological ordination technique, principal \ncomponents analysis (PCA), can be used to exam- \nine relationships between benthos community \nstructure, toxicology, and the physical-chemical \nattributes of the bottom sediments, (Cross et al., \n1991, in review). PCA is used to reduce the \nmultidimensionality of the benthos data, creating \ntwo variables (principal component or PC) from \nthe original matrix of many variables (taxon \nabundances). These PCS can then be correlated \nwith PQ derived from physicalchemical data a \nbioassay results, or with individual physical or \nchemical parameters. High correlations among \nPCs from the three Triad components indic@e \nagreement or concordance of impact assessments. \nCorrelations of PCs from benthic data (or \nbioassay data) with individual chemical parameters \ncan be used to assess or develop sediment quaIity \naiteria. The impacts associated with existing \naiteria can be expressed as a PC score for benthic \ndata, calculated from a regression of these scores \non chemical concentrations. Sediment quality \ncriteria could also be developed by predicting the \nchemical concentration associated with a signifi- \ncant impact on the benthic community, provided \nthat \u201csignificant impact\u201d could be unequivocally \nassociated with a particular PC score or range of \nscores. \nMantel\u2019s Test \nAnother method that can be used to determine \nwhether different components of the Triad are \nrelated is Mantel\u2019s test (Mantel, 1967; Legentire \nand Fortin, 1989). Mantel\u2019s test uses a random- \nization procedure that akuiates the probability \nthat two distance matrices are more similar than \nwould be expected by chance alone. Multivariate \nlo-10 \nlO-Triad Approach \n(or univariatc) distance between each of the sites \n(observations) can be calculated using data from \neach component of the Triad. For example, to \ndevelop a distance matrix based on toxicity test \nresults, each of the toxicology variables would be \nused to develop the distance. Similar matrices \nwould be calculated for benthos and chemistry \ndata. \nThe randomization procedure ensures that the \nrelationships between two distance matrices are \nreal and not spurious. The distance between two \nstations (A and 8) is always partially related to \nthe distance between these two and other stations \n(e.g., A and C, B and C). Mantel\u2019s test avoids the \npossibility of spurious correlations by calculating \ncorrelations between the two matrices based on \nrandom samples, and comparing the actual correla- \ntion with the distribution based on the random \nsamples. \n10.2.1.2.4 Necessary Hardware and Skills \nAppropriate sampling equipment and trained \nfield and laboratory personnel are required for \nchemical analyses, toxicity testing, and benthic \ninfaunal analyses. Although the equipment re- \nquired can be both costly and sophisticated, it is \ncommonly necessary for sediment contamination \ninvestigations. The necessary equipment, facili- \nties, and expertise are generally available through \na wide variety of government, university, cornmer- \ncial, and private facilities. \n10.2.1.3 Adequacy of Documenfdon \nDocumentation for use of this method is \nprovided by Long and Chapman (1985), Chapman \n(1986, 1989, 1990), and Chapman el al. (1986, \n1987a, 1991a, 1991b). Other investigators have \nalso successfully applied this method (cf. Chap- \nman et al., 1991c). \n10.2.2 Applicability of Method to Human \nHealth, Aquatic Life, or Wildlife \nProtection \nThis approach is directly applicable to the \nprotection of aquatic life. To date, only benthic invertebrates and fish have been used to assess in \nsi.2~ biological effeds and sediment toxicity. \nProtection of aquatic life may indirectly proted \nwildlife (e.g., wading birds feeding on benthos) \nand humans (e.g., via consumption of aquatic life). \nThe approach can be directly applicable to human \nhealth and wildIife protection if the Triad comPo- \nnents are redirected towards issues such as \nbacteria1 contamination and toxic contaminant bio- \naccumulation. For instance, Triad could be used \nin three ways to address bacterial problems: \n(1) measure bacterial contamination in water or \nsediment, (2) measure bacterial diseases or con- \ncentrations in tissues, and (3) perform laboratory \ntests to quantify relationships between sedi- \nment/water concentrations and effects. Toxic \ncontaminant bioaccumulation could be addressed \nby these uses of the Triad approach: (1) measure \ntoxic contaminant concentrations in water or \nsediment, (2) measure bioconcentration/biomag- \nnification in lissues, and (3) perform laboratory \ntests to determine effects related to bioconcen- \ntration and biomagnification. \n10.23 Ability of Method to Generate \nNumerical Criteria for Specific \nChemicals \nThe Triad approach has been used to generate \ncriteria for three contaminants: lead, PAH, and \nPCBs (Chapman, 1986). These criteria were \ndeveloped in Puget Sound by examining large data \nsets to identify contaminant areas and concen- \ntrations that were associated with no or minima1 \nbiological effects. The criteria fall within a factor \nof 2 to 10 of values generated for the-se contami- \nnants by the screening-level concentration (see \nChapter 11, Section ll.l.l.), the AET approach \n(see Chapter ll), and laboratory toxicity methods \n(Chapman el ol., 1987b). As detailed by Chap- \nman (1989), the AET application of the Triad \nconcept provides criteria for benthic infauna and \neach bioassay conducted, whereas the latter corn- \nbines all bioassay and in sihc biological effects \ndata to provide a single value, interpretation, or \nanalysis. However, there has been little work \nsince Chapman (1986) on development of the \nSediment Class$cation Methods Compendium \nTriad approach for the production of numerical \nsediment quality criteria separate from AET. \n10.3 USEFULNESS \n103.1 Environmental Applicability \nAlthough the Triad approach is both labor- \nintensive and expensive, its strengths render it \nextremely cost-effective for the level of infor- \nmation provided. First, it provides empirical \nevidence of sediment quality (based on observa- \ntion, not theory). Second, it allows ecological \ninterpretation of physical, chemical, and biological \nproperties (i.e., interpretation of how these relate \nto the real environment). Third, it uses a prepon- \nderance-ofevidence approach rather than relying \non single measurements (i.e., all the data are \nconsidered). Because of the comprehensive nature \nof Triad studies, additional follow-up studies are \nusually not necessary. Finally, the data generated \nby the Triad approach can be used to generate \neffects-based classification indexes. \nThe Triad approach enables investigators to \nestimate the size of degraded and nondegraded \nareas. It also provides a test of the quality of \nreference areas (i.e., do contamination or biologi- \ncal effects occur?). Standards in the form of \nsediment quality criteria (Chapman, 1986, 1989; \nITI, 1988a, 1988b) can be set from the contami- \nnant concentrations that are always associated with \neffects, using the AET application of the Triad. \nThe Triad approach also provides the information \nnecessary to describe the ecological relationships \nbetween sediment properties and biota at risk from \nsediment contamination. \nThe Triad approach has been used in dredging \nstudies to support dredged material disposal siting \nand disposal decisions (aapman, unpublished). \nIn multiplying the relative degree of degradation \nat a site by the volume of sediment to be dredged, \ninvestigators can compare different sites, provided \nthat the same reference area is used. This com- \nparison helps investigators determine whether \ndredging will affect useful habitat or result in \nmaterial unacceptable for ocean disposal. Similar- ly, potential disposal sites can be compared with \neach other and with the material to be dredged, \nand then compared to acceptability criteria for \nvarious uses and options. This application of the \nTriad approach replaces similar but less useful \ncomparisons based solely on the total mass of \nchemical contaminants to be dredged. \nIn areas where benthic communities have been \neliminated or drastically changed because of a \nnatural event (e.g., storms, oxygen depletion) or \nphysical anthropogenic impact (e.g., recent dredg- \ning, boat scour), the other two Triad components \n(sediment chemistry and toxicity) provide informa- \ntion when conventional univariate approaches \nwould prove deficient. Such cases emphasize the \nneed to use knowledge of an area in making any \ntype of environmental assessment, including the \nSediment Quality Triad. \nThe Triad approach can be used to discern \nand ultimately to monitor regional trends in \nsediment quality. Such information is necessary \nto delineate areas that are excessively contami- \nnated with toxic chemicals affecting the biota and, \ntherefore, most in need of remedial action. Pilot \nstudies of this nature have been conducted in \nPuget Sound and San Francisco Bay (Long and \nChapman, 1985; Chapman, 1986; Chapman cl al., \n1986, 1987a) and in Europe (e.g., Chapman, in \npress; Chapman et (II.; in press). \n3.1.1 Suitability for Ditrerent Sediment \nVP= \nThe Triad approach can be used with all \nsediment lypes, including sands, muds, aerobic \nsediments, and anaerobic sediments. It includes \nsediment characterization with physical parameters \n[e.g., ,gtain size, acid volatile sulfides (AVS), and \ntotal organic carbon (TOC)] that may be important \nin interpreting the Triad compounds. For exam- \nple, caution must be used in interpreting the \nresults of toxicity tests in sediments that remain \nanaerobic in the laboratory despite aeration. \nSpecifically, organisms will die from lack of \noxygen, making it difficult to distinguish that \nmortality loom toxicity due to high concentrations \nof contaminants. \n10-12 \n10.3.1.2 Suirability for Different Chemicals or \nClasses of Chemicals \nThe Triad approach can be used with all \nchemicals or classes of chemicals, provided that \nbioassay organisms and tests are appropriate for \nall chemicals. For this reason, a battery of bioas- \nsay tests 1s recommended. Caution must be used \nwhen testing sediment extracts that may be specif- \nic to certain chemical classes. Interpretation of \nthe results must be restricted to only those \nchemicals. \n10.3.1.3 Suitability for Predicting Eflects on \nDiflerent Organisms \nApplication of the Triad approach can be \nlimited by the organisms in the environment if the \nin situ effects are determined primarily by the \nsame species used in the bioassay tests. In other \nwords, all biological effects data are based on a \nsingle species. ln such cases, independence of the \ninfaunal community analyses and bioassay test \nresults cannot be assumed. Hence, more than one \nbioassay test is recommended. Ideally, the tests \nwould include a wide variety of organisms, life \nstages, feeding types, and exposure routes. \n10.3.1.4 Suitability for in-Place Pollutant Control \nThe Triad approach provides a comprehensive \napproach to in-place pollutant control because it \nallows for assessment of all potential interactions \nbetween chemical mixtures and the environment. \nThis method is comprehensive because it includes \nthe measurements of multiple chemicals as well as \nthe potential toxic effects of both measured and \nunmeasured chemicals. \n10.3.1.5 Suitability for Source Control \nThe Triad approach is as suitable for sour- \ncontrol as it is for in-place pollutant control. It \ncan be an environmental complement to toxicity \nreduction evaluation (TRE) programs that involve \nchemical and toxicity investigations of sediments, \nand effluents and other discharges. 10.3.1.6 Suitability for Disposal Applicatians \nThe Triad approach has been used for disposal \napplications, including Navy Homeporting work in \nSan Francisco Bay. in that study, the Triad \napproach clearly separated potential dredge sites \nfrom one another in terms of the relative level of \npollution. Although the Triad was not used in the \nfinal decision because of other considerations, \ndecision-makers were able to use information \nprovided by the Triad to compare the suitability of \ndredging and disposal options. \n103.2 General Advantages and Limitations \nThe following are the major advantages of the \nTriad approach: \nCombines three separate components to \nprovide a preponderance-of-evidence \napproach; \nDoes not require a priori assumptions \nconcerning the specific mechanisms of \ninteraction between organisms and toxic \ncontaminants; \nCan be used to develop sediment quality \nvalues (including criteria) for any mea- \nsured contaminant or a combination of \ncontaminants, including both acute and \nchronic effects; \nProvides empirical evidence of sediment \nquality; \nCan be used for any sediment type; \nAllows ef3logical interpretation of both \nphysical-chemical and biological proper- \nties; and \nDoes not usually required follow-up when \na complete study is conducted. \nThe following are the major limitations to the \nTriad approach: \nlo-13 \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \nn Statistical criteria have not been fully \ndeveloped for use with the Triad approach \n(but see Section 10.2.1.2.3, Types of Data \nRequired); \nn Rigorous criteria for calculating single \nindexes from each of the sediment chem- \nistry, bioassay, and in situ biological \neffects data sets have not been developed \n(but may not be required); \nn A large database is required; \nn If the approach is used to determine sin- \ngle-chemical criteria, results could be \nstrongly influenced by the presence of \nunmeasured toxic contaminants that may \nor may not covary with measured \nchemicals; \nn Methods for sediment bioassay testing \nneed to be standardized; \nl Sample collection, analysis, and inter- \npretation are labor-intensive and expen- \nsive; and \nn The choice of a reference site is often \nmade without adequate information on \nhow degraded the site may be. \n10.3.2.1 Ease of Use \nThe Triad approach is relatively easy to use \nand understand. The concept is straightforward. \nA high level of chemical and biological expertise \nis required to obtain the data for the three separate \nTriad componenls. However, many laboratories or \ngroups of laboratories possess the required \nexpertise. \n10.3.2.2 Relative Cost \nRelative cost can be evaluated in either dollars \nor environmental damage. The Triad approach \nmay not prevent environmental damage, but it can \nbe used to identify contaminated areas for future \nremediation. In terms of dollars, the Triad ap- proach requires substantial resources to be imple- \nmented properly, although step-wise, tiered use of \nTriad components is possible. Measured against \nthe potential environmental damage due to toxic \ncontamination and the costs of remediation, the \nTriad approach can be extremely cost-effedive. \n10.3.2.3 Tendency to Be Conservative \nThe Triad approach provides objedive data \nwith which to determine and sometimes to predict \nenvironmental damage. Its predictive ability \nallows for, but does not require, conservatism on \nthe part of the decision-makers. \n10.3.2.4 Level of Acceptance \nThe Triad approach is gaining a high level of \nacceptance in various parts of North America and \nin Europe (Forstner et al., 1987; Chapman, in \npress). In addition, Canada has conducted Triad \nstudies in Vancouver to determine the suitability \nof this approach for implementation of the new \nCanadian Environmental Protedion Ad (Cross et \nal., 1991; Cross et al., in review). \n10.3.2.5 AbiIity to Be Implemented by \nL&oratories with Typical Equipment \nand Handling Facilities \nAll aspects of the Triad approach (i.e., benthic \ninfaunal studies, sediment chemistry analyses, \nsediment toxicity bioassays) can be conducted by \nany competent, specialist laboratory that is reason- \nably well equipped. The major requirements are \nadequate QNQC procedures for chemical mea- \nsurements; appropriate detection limits; and, for \nbiological analyses, taxonomic experts and a \ntaxonomic reference library or museum. \n10.3.2.6 Level of Efort Required to Generate \nResults \nDifferent levels of effort will generate differ- \nent levels of results. For instance, results can be \ngenerated by simply measuring one or two chcmi- \ncals, determining the number of infauna present, \nand conduding a single sediment toxicity bioas- \n10-14 \nIO-Triad Approach \nsay. However, the applicability of these results \nmay be severely limited. Consequently, multiple \nchemicals including inorganic and organic com- \npounds should be measured, and in situ biological \nalteration and sediment toxicity should be mea- \nsured multiple times. Although it is possible to \nuse previously collected nonsynoptic data to \nderive results in a \u201cpaper\u201d study (Long and fiap- \nman, 1985), fieldwork dnd synoptic sampling \ngenerate the most useful results. \n10.3.2.7 Degree to Which Results Lend \nThemselves to Interpretation \nBeyond the general conclusions noted in Table \n10-2, expert judgment is required to implement \nand interpret the Triad approach. In particular, the \ndefinition of \u201cminimal\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d biological \neffects is required to establish chemical-specific \ncriteria. The Triad approach reflects the complex- \nity of the issues that must be addressed to assess \nenvironmental quality. \n10.3.2.8 Degree of Environmental Applicability \nAs discussed, the Triad approach has an \nextremely high degree of environmental applim- \nbility (see Section 10.3.1). \n10.3.2.9 Degree of Accuracy and Precision \nThe accuracy and precision of the Triad \napproach have not been quantitatively determined. \nIt is expected to have a high degree of accuracy \nand precision, although these parameters will vary \nwith those of the constituent components. \n10.4 STATUS \n10.4.1 Extent of Use \n,Development of the formalized Triad concept \nhas occurred relatively recently (ktg and Chap- \nman, 1985; Utapman, 1986, 1990; Chapman et \nal., 1986, 1987a, 1988, 1991a). The Triad ap- \nproach has been used directly to establish sedi- \nment quality criteria (Chapman, 1986) and, through data manipulations, to determine AFT \nvalues for sediment quality uiteria (Tetra Tech, \n1986a; PTI, 1988a, 1988b). \nThe Triad has been used to identify spatial \nand temporal trends of pollution-induced degrada- \ntion. indexes developed using the Triad approach \ncan be numeric (as described in Chapter 11 for the \nAFT application of the Triad concept) or primarily \ndescriptive (see Figure 2, Chapman ef al., 1987a). \nIn either case, the Triad approach provides an \nobjective identification of sites where contami- \nnation is causing discernible harm (cf. Power et \nal., 1991). \n10.4.2 Extent to Which Approach Has Been \nField-Validated \nBecause the Triad approach measures in situ \nbiological alteration in the field, field validation is \nan integral part of each complete Triad \ninvestigation. \n10.43 Reasons for Limited Use \nAs previously described, the Triad approach is \nbeing used in the United States, Canada, and \nEurope for marine, estuarine, and freshwater areas. \nIt is not being used in small projects because of \nthe cost and expertise required for full \nimplementation. \n10.4.4 Outlook for Future Use and Amount \nof Development Yet Needed \nThe following areas of the Triad approach \nrequire development: \nn Determining tire appropriateness of the \nvarious endpoints of different bioassays, \nsekted chemical contaminants, selected \nmeasures of benthic community structure, \nand other potential measures of in siru \nbiological alteration; \nm Determining the appropriateness of an \nadditive treatment of the data (e.g., sum- \nming bioassay responses to provide a \nsingle index for toxicity); \nlo-15 \nSdimcnt Cfass~tidn lAdha& Gqxndium \nB Further development of statisticai criteria; \nn Development of rigorous criteria for de- \ntermining, where and if appropriate, com- \nposite indexes for each of the three Triad \ncomponents; and \nn Continued standardization of methods for \nsediment toxicity bioassays. \nEven without development of these areas, the \nTriad approach provides valuable information. \nThe argument has been made (Chapman er al., \n1986, 1987a) that the Triad approach provides \nobjective information on which to judge the extent \nof pollution-induced degradation. For this reason \nthe Triad approach will likely be used much more \nwidely in future. \n10.5 REFERENCES \nAlden, R. W. II. 1992. Uncertainty and sediment \nquality assessments: I.

Following the development of ART values for \na particular geographic area, they can be used to \npredict whether statistically significant biological \neffects are expected at a station with known \nconcentrations of toxic chemicals. \n11.1 SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS \n11.1.1 Current Use \nAt present, the AET approach is being used \nby several programs as guidelines for the protec- \ntion of aquatic life in Puget Sound. These guide- \nlines are the culmination of cooperative planning \nand scientific investigations that were initiated by \nseveral federal and state agencies in the early and \nmid-1980s. \nThree programs and applications of the AET \napproach are highlighted below. Notably, all \nthese programs involve an element of direct \nbiological testing in conjunction with the use of \nAET values, in recognition of the fact that no \napproach to chemical sediment quality values is \n100 percent reliable in predicting adverse biologi- \ncal effects- An underlying strategy in many of \nthese programs was to develop two sets of sedi- \nment quality values based primarily on AET \nvalues: \n\u2022 One set of values identifies low chemical \nconcentrations below which biological \neffects are improbable. \n\u2022 A second set of values identifies higher \nchemical concentrations above which \nmultiple biological effects are expected. The programs incorporate direct biological testing \nin concentration ranges between these two ex- \ntremes to serve as a \u201csafety net\u201d (i.e., to account \nfor the uncertainty of chemical predictions) for \npotential adverse effects or anomalous situations \nat \u201cmoderate\u201d chemical concentrations. \nCommencement Bay Nearshore/Tideflats \nSuperfund Investigation \nCommencement Bay is a heavily industrial- \nized harbor in Tacoma, WA. Recent surveys have \nindicated over 281 industrial activities in the \nnearshore/tideflats area. Comprehensive shoreline \nsurveys have identified more than 400 point and \nnonpoint source discharges in the study area, \nconsisting primarily of seeps, storm drains, and \nopen channels. A remedial investigation (RI) \nunder Superfund, started in 1983, revealed 25 \nmajor sources contributing to sediment contamina- \ntion, including major chemical manufacturing, \npulp mills, shipbuilding and repair, and smelter \noperations. Adverse biological effects were found \nin sediments adjacent to these sources. \nThe AET approach was developed during the \ncourse of the RI to assess sediment quality using \nchemical and biological effects data [i.e., depres- \nsions in the number of individual benthic taxa, \npresence of tumors and other abnormalities in \nbottom fish, and several laboratory toxicity tests \n(amphipod mortality, oyster larvae abnormality, \nbacterial bioluminescence)]. AET values were \nalso used in the subsequent feasibility study (FS) \nto identify cleanup goals and define volumes of \ncontaminated sediment for remediation. The AET \nvalues used in the FS were generated from a \nreduced set of biological effects indicators, which \ncomprised depressions in total benthic abundance, \namphipod mortality, oyster larvae abnormality, \nand bacterial luminescence.. \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \nPuget Sound Dredged Disposal Analysis Program \nIn 1985, the Puget Sound Dredged Disposal \nAnalysis (PSDDA) program was initiated to \ndevelop environmentally safe and publicly accept- \nable options for unconfined, open-water disposal \nof dredged material. PSDDA is a cooperative \nprogram conducted under the direction of the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers (Corps) Seattle District, \nUS. EPA Region X, the Washington Department \nof Ecology (Ecology), and the Washington De- \npartment of Natural Resources (WDNR). AET \nvalues were used to develop chemical-specific \nguidelines to determine whether biological testing \non contaminated dredged material is needed. \nResults of the biological testing help determine \nsuitable disposal alternatives. \nAbove a specified chemical concentration (i.e., \nthe screening-level concentration or SLC) biologi- \ncal testing is required to determine the suitability \nof dredged material for unconfined, open-water \ndisposal. Based primarily on AET values for \nmultiple biological indicators, a higher \u201cmaximum \nlevel concentration\u201d was also identified. Above \nthis latter concentration, failure of biological tests \nis considered to be predictable. However, an \noptional series of biological tests can be conducted \nunder PSDDA to demonstrate the suitability of \nsuch contaminated material for unconfined, open- \nwater disposal (Phillips et al., 1988). \nUrban Bay Toxics Action Program \nThe Urban Bay Toxics Action Program is a \nmultiphase program to control pollution of urban \nbays in Puget Sound. The program includes steps \nto identify areas where contaminated sediments \nare associated with adverse biological effects, \nspecify potential pollution sources, develop an \naction plan for source control, and form an action \nteam for plan implementation. Initiated in 1984 \nby Ecology and U.S. EPA Region X\u2019s Office of \nPuget Sound, the program is a major component \nof the Puget Sound Estuary Program (PSEP). \nSubstantial participation has also been provided by \nthe Puget Sound Water Quality Authority (Author- \nity) and other state agencies and local govern- \nments. Major funding and overall guidance for the program is provided by U.S. EPA Office of \nWetlands, Oceans and Watersheds. \nIn the PSEP urban bay program, AET values \nare used in conjunction with site-specific biologi- \ncal tests during the assessment of sediment con- \ntamination to define and rank problem areas. \nSource control actions are well under way, but \nsediment remediation has not yet begun at any of \nthe sites (PTI, 1988). \n11.1.2 Potential use \nThe AET approach to determining sediment \nquality can also be used as follows: \n\u2022 To determine the spatial extent and rela- \ntive priority of areas of contaminated \nsediment; \n\u2022 To identify potential problem chemicals in \nimpacted sediments and, as a result, to \nfocus cleanup activities on potential \nsources of problem contaminants; \n\u2022 To define and prioritize laboratory studies \nfor determining cause-effect relationships; \nand \n\u2022 With appropriate safety factors or other \nmodifications, to screen sediments in \nregulatory programs that involve extensive \nbiological testing. \nProposed regulations for sediment contamination \nare currently under review in Puget Sound. These \nregulations may include use of AET values to \ndevelop statewide sediment quality standards. \nEcology is currently developing a suite of sedi- \nment management standards, as mandated by the \nPuget Sound Water Quality Authority (1988) in its \n1989 Management Plan. The proposed standards \nare based in part on AET values. Development of \nthese standards (Becker et al., 1989) relies heavily \non the past and ongoing efforts described in \nSection 11.1.1 and involves active participation by \nEcology, U.S. EPA, the Authority, WDNR, the \nCorps (Seattle District), and various public interest \ngroups. The draft regulation currently under \n11-2 \nII-AET Appwch \ndevelopment affects only sediments in Puget \nSound. As additional data become available from \nother locations, the adopted regulation will eventu- \nally be broadened and modified to include the \nentire state. \n11.2 DESCRIPTION \n11.2.1 Description of Method \nAET values are derived using a straightfor- \nward algorithm that relates biological and chemi- \ncal data from field-collected samples. For a given \ndata set, the AET for a given chemical is the \nsediment concentration above which a particular \nadverse biological effect (e.g., depressions in the \ntotal abundance of indigenous benthic infauna) is \nalways statistically significant (PsO.05) relative to \nappropriate reference conditions. The calcutalion \nof an AET for each chemical and biological \nindicator is conducted as follows: \n(1) Collect \u201cmatched\u201d chemical and biological \neffects data-Conduct chemical and bio- \nlogical effects testing on subsamples of \nthe same field sample. (To avoid unac- \ncountable losses of benthic organisms, \nbenthic infaunal and chemical analyses \nare conducted on separate samples collect- \ned concurrently at the same location.) \n(2) Identify \u201cimpacted\u201d and \u201cnonimpacted\u201d \nstations-Statistically test the significance \nof adverse biological effects relative to \nsuitable reference conditions for each \nsediment sample. Suitable reference \nconditions are established by sediments \nexhibiting very low or undetectable con- \ncentrations of any toxic chemicals, an ab- \nsence of other adverse effects, and physi- \ncal characteristics that are directly compa- \nrable with those of the test sediments. \n(3) Identify AET using only \u201cnonimpacted\u201d \nstations-For each chemical, the AET can \nbe identified for a given biological indica- \ntor as the highest detected concentration among sediment samples that do not \nexhibit statistically significant effects. (If \nthe chemical is undetected in all non- \nimpacted samples, then no AET can be \nestablished for that chemical and biolog- \nical indicator.) \n(4) Check for preliminary m-Verify that \nstatistically significant biological effects \nare observed at a chemical concentration \nhigher than the AET, otherwise, the AET \nshould be regarded only as a preliminary \nminimum estimate. \n(5) Repeat Steps (l)-(4) for each biological \nindicator. \nThe AET approach for a group of field-col- \nlected sediment samples is shown in Figure 11-l. \nThe samples were collected at various locations \nand were analyzed for (1) toxicity in a laboratory \nbioassay and (2) the concentrations of a suite of \nchemicals, including lead and 4-methylphenol. \nBased on the results of bioassays conducted on the \nsediments from each station, two subpopulations \nof all sediments are represented by bars in the \nfigure: \nn Sediments that did not exhibit statistically \nsignificant (P~0.05) toxicity relative to \nreference conditions (\u201cnonimpact& sta- \ntions) and \nn Sediments that exhibited statistically \nsignificant (P&05) toxicity in bioassays \nrelative to reference conditions (\u201cimpact- \ned\u201d stations). \nOver the observed range of concentrations for \nthese sediment samples (horizontal axis in Figure \n11-l), the sediments fall into two groups for each \nchemical: \n8 At low to moderate concentrations, signif- \nicant sediment toxicity occurred in some \nsamples, but not in others. \nn At concentrations above an apparent \nthreshold value, significant sediment \ntoxicity occurre~J in all samples. \nSediment C&ssfbtion h4ethods Compendium \nLead \nSP-14 \n4 660 ppm M-16 \niMPACTED 4 \nI otzzmmmmmm a 0 G I \nNONIMPACTED \nAET \nI , I111111, I I I1 ,,,I, I 111,111, 1 I I ItIll, I , !

Above this AET value, significant sediment \ntoxicity was always observed in the data set \nexamined. Data are treated in this manner to \nreduce the weight given to samples in which \nfactors other than the contaminant examined (e.g., \nother contaminants, environmental variables) may \nbe responsible for the biological effect. \nFor each chemical, additional AET values \ncould be defined for other biological indicators \nthat were tested (e.g., other bioassay responses or \ndepressions in the abundances of certain indige- \nnous benthic infauna). \n11.2.1.1 Objectives and Assutnprions \nThe objective of the ART approach is to \nidentify concentrations of contaminants that are \nassociated exclusively with sediments exhibiting \nstatistically significant biological effects relative to \nreference sediments. AET value generation is a \nconceptually simple process and incorporates the \ncomplexity of biological-chemical interrelation- \nships in the environment without relying on CI \npriori assumptions about the mechanisms of these \ninterrelationships. Although the ART approach \ndoes not require specific assumptions about \nmechanisms of the uptake and toxic action of \nchemicals, it does rely on more general assump- \ntions regarding the interpretation of matched \nbiological and chemical data for field-collected \nsamples, as described below: \nn For a given chemical, concentrations can \nbe as high as the AET value and not be \nassociated witb statistically significant \nbiological effects (for the indicator on \nwhich the AET was based). \nn When biological impacts are observed at \nconcentrations below an ART value for a \ngiven chemical, it is assumed that the \nimpacts may be related to another chemi- \ncal, chemical interactive effects, or other \nenvironmental factors (e.g., sediment \nanoxia). n The ART concept is consistent with a \nrelationship between increasing concen- \ntrations of toxic chemicals and increasing \nbiological effects (as observed in laborato- \nry exposure studies). \nThe assumptions in interpreting environmental \ndata are demonstrated below with actual field data. \nUsing Figure 1 l-l as an example, sediment from \nStation SP-14 exhibited severe toxicity, potentially \nrelated to a greatly elevated concentrations of 4- \nmethylphenol (7,400 times reference levels). The \nsame sediment from Station SP-14 contained a \nrelatively low concentration of lead that was well \nbelow the AET for lead (Figure 11-l). Despite \nthe toxic effects associated with the sample, \nsediments from many other stations with higher \nlead concentrations than Station SP-14 exhibited \nno statistically significant biological effects. \nThese results were interpreted to suggest that the \neffects at Station SP-14 were potentially associat- \ned with 4-methylphenol (or a substance with a \nsimilar environmental distribution) but were less \nlikely to be associated with lead. A converse \nargument can be made for lead and 4-methyl- \nphenol in sediments from Station RS-18. \nApplied in this manner, the ART approach \nhelps to identify measured chemicals that are \npotentially associated with observed effects at \neach biologically impacted site and eliminates \nfrom consideration chemicals that are far less \nlikely to be associated with effects (i.e., the latter \nchemicals have been observed at higher concentra- \ntions at other sites witbout associated biological \neffects). Based on the results for lead and \n4-methylphenol, bioassay toxicity at five of the \nimpacted sites shown in the figure may be associ- \nated with elevated concentrations of 4-methyl- \nphenol, and toxicity at eight other sites may be \nassociated with elevated concentrations of lead (or \nsimilarly distributed contaminants). \nAs illustrated by these results, the occurrence \nof biologically impacted stations at concentrations \nbelow the AET of a single chemical does not \nimply that ART values in general are not protec- \ntive against biological effects, only that single \nchemicals may not account for all stations with \nbiologica effect& By developing ARTS for \nsediment C&ss@Aon Methods Compendium \nmultiple chemicals, a high percentage of all \nstations with biological effects are accounted for \nwith the AET approach (see Section 11.3.2.9 and \nUSEPA, 1988). \nAETs can be expected to be more predictive \nwhen developed from a large, diverse database \nwith wide ranges of chemical concentrations and \na wide diversity of measured chemicals. Data sets \nthat have large concentration gaps between sta- \ntions and/or do not cover a wide range of ooncen- \ntrations must be scrutinized carefully (e.g., to \ndiscern whether chemical concentrations in the \ndata set exceed reference concentrations) to deter- \nmine whether AET generation is appropriate. \n11.2.1.2 Level of Eflort \n11.2.1.2.1 Type of SampIing Required \nCollection of field data for initial generation \nof AETs is a labor-intensive and capital-intensive \nprocess. The exact level of sampling effort \nrequired depends on the amount and variety of \ndata collected (e.g., the number of samples collect- \ned, the diversity of biological indicators that are \ntested, and the range of chemicals measured). \nOne means of minimizing these costs is to com- \npile existing data that meet appropriate quality \nassurance criteria. There are no definitive require- \nments for the size and variety of the database, \nalthough a study of the predictive abilities of the \nAET approach with Puget Sound data (Barrick et \nal., 1988) resulted in the following recommend- \nations for data collection: \nn Collect or compile chemical and biologi- \ncal effects data from 50 stations or more \n(and from suitable reference areas). \nn Bias the positioning of stations to ensure \nsampling of various contaminant sources \n(e.g., urban environments with a range of \ncontaminant sources and, preferably, with \nbroad geographic distribution) over a \nrange of contaminant concentrations (pref- \nerably over at least l-2 orders of magni- \ntude). \nn Conduct chemical tests for a wide range \nof chemical classes (e.g., metals, nonionic organic compounds, ionizable organic \ncompounds). To generate AETs on an \norganic &on-normalized basis, total \norganic carbon (TOC) measurements are \nrequired in all sediments. \nm Ensure that detection limits of <lOO ppb \n(lower if possible) are attained for organic \ncompounds. High detection limits (i.e., \ninsensitive analyses) can obscure the \noccurrence of chemicals at low to mod- \nerate concentrations; as noted previously, \nonly detect@ data are used in AET calcu- \nlations. Metals are naturally occurring \nsubstances, and most metals concentra- \ntions typically exceed routine de-ion \nlimits. \nThe only strict requirement for field sampling \nof data for AET generation is the collection of \n\u201cmatched\u201d chemical and biological data (as dc \nsaibed at the beginning of Section 11.2.1). \nMatched data sets should be used to reduce the \npossibility that uneven (spatially variable) sedi- \nment amtamination could result in associating \nbiological and chemical data that are based on \ndissimilar sediment samples. Because the toxic \nresponses of stationary organisms (e.g., bioassay \norganisms confined to a test sediment, or infaunal \norganisms largely confined to a small area) are \nassumed to be affected by direct association with \ncontaminants in the surrounding environment, it is \nconsidered essential that chemical and biological \ndata be collected from nearly identical subsamples \nfrom a given station. \n1X2.1.2.2 Methods \nMethodological details for the generation of \nAET values are d+bed at the beginning of \nSe&ion 11.2.1. \n11.2.1.23 \u2018I)pes of Data Required \nrIJw0 fundamental kinds of data analysis are \nrequired for AET generation: \nn Statistical analysis of the significance of \nbiological effects relative to reference II-AET Approach \nconditions (i.e., classification of stations \nas impacted or nonimpacted for each \nbiological indicator) and \nn Generation of an AET value for each \nchemical and biological indicator (essen- \ntially a process of ranking stations based \non chemical concentration). \nAdditional kinds of data analysis needed for \nAET generation are quality assurance/quality \ncontrol (QA/QC) review of biological and chemi- \ncal data, and evaluation of the appropriateness of \nreference area stations. These topics have been \ndescribed elsewhere {e.g., Belier et al., 1986; \nBarrick et al., 1988). \nThe AET method does not intrinsicaIly require \na specific method of statistical analysis for deter- \nmination of significance of biological effects \nrelative to reference conditions. Existing Puget \nSound AETs have relied largely on pairwise \nt-tests; details of statistical analyses performed for \nthe generation of Puget Sound AET have been de- \nscribed elsewhere (USEPA, 1988; Banick ef al., \n1988; Beller et al., 1986). For example, the \nfollowing steps were used to determine tbe statisti- \ncal significance of amphipod mortality bioassay \nresults (Swartz et al., 1985) in field-collected \nsediments: \nAll replicates from all stations in the \nreference area used for each study were \npooled, and a mean bioassay response and \nstandard deviation were calculated. \nResults from each potentially impacted \nsite were then compared statistically with \nthe reference conditions using painvise \nanalysis. \nThe F,, test (Sokal and Rohlf, 1%9) was \nused to test for homogeneity of variances \nbetween each pair of mean values. \nIf variances were homogenous, then a \nt-test was used to compare the two means. \nIf variances were not homogenous, then an \napproximate t-test (Sokal and Rohlf, 1969) \nwas used to compare the two means. n Statistical significance was tested with a \npairwise error rate of 0.05 to ensure con- \nsistency among studies of differing sam- \nple sizes. \nData analyses that have been applied to other \nbiological indicators are described elsewhere \n(Beller et al., 1986; Barrick et al., 1988). Nota- \nbly, comparisons to reference conditions were \nsomewhat more complicated for benthic infaunal \nabundances than for sediment bioassays. For \nbenthic infaunal comparisons, reference data for \neach potentially impacted site were categorized so \nthat comparisons were made with samples collect- \ned during the same season, at a similar depth, and \nwhenever possible, in sediments with similar \nparticle size characteristics (i.e., percentage of \nparticles ~64 pm) as those of the potentially im- \npacted site. In this manner, statistical comparisons \nwere normalized to account for the influence of \nthree of the major natural variables known to \ninfluence the abundance and distribution of bcn- \nthic macroinvertebrates. All benthic data were \nalso log-transformed so that data distributions \nconformed to the assumptions of the parametric \nstatistical tests that were applied. Additional data \ntreatment methods presented elsewhere (Barrick et \nal., 1988) are not discussed further herein, because \nthey are not considered intrinsic to the AET ap- \npreach, but rather are options to address poteu- \ntially unusual matrices or biological conditions. \n11.2.1.2.4 Necessary Hardware and Skills \nThe primary skills required for AET genera- \ntion are related to the development of the biologi- \ncal/chemical database. Expertise in environmental \nchemistry is required to evaluate chemical data \nquality, and the need for normalization of chemi- \ncal data and related factors. Biological and \nstatistical expertise are required for the determina- \ntion of statistical significance. For benthic data in \nparticular, evaluation of appropriate reference \nconditions and knowledge of benthic taxonomy \nand ecology are necessary. \nComputers are recommended for the efficient \ngeneration of AET values. A menudriven data- \nbase (SEDQUAL) has been developed for U.S. \n11-7 \nSediment Class~icution Methods Compendium \nEPA Region X that is capable of a number of data \nmanipulation tasks, including the following: \n(1) storing chemical and biological data, (2) calcu- \nlating AET values, (3) comparing a specified set \nof AET to stored sediment chemistry data to \nidentify stations at which adverse biological \neffects are or are not predicted, and (4) based on \nsuch comparisons, calculating the rate of correct \nprediction of biological impacts. The SEDQUAL \nsystem, which requires an IBM-AT compatible \ncomputer with a bard disk, has been documented \nin detail in a user\u2019s manual (Nielsen, 1988). The \nSEDQUAL database currently includes stored data \nfrom Puget Sound (over 1,000 samples, not all of \nwhich have biological and chemical data). \n1X.2.1.3 Adequacy of Documentation \nVarious aspects of the AET approach have \nbeen extensively documented in reports prepared \nfor U.S. EPA and other regulatory agencies, as \nlisted below and in the reference list: \nn \nl \nn \nn \n11.2.2 Generation of Puget Sound AET values \nand evaluation of tbeir predictive ability \n(Beller et al., 1986; Banick et al., 1988); \nData used to generate Puget Sound AET \nvalues (appendices of Beller et al., 1986 \nand field surveys cited in Beller et al., \n1986 and Barrick et al., 1988); \nBriefing report to the U.S. EPA Science \nAdvisory Board (USEPA, 1988); and \nPolicy implications of effects-based ma- \nrine sediment criteria (PTI, 1987). \nApplicability of Method to Human \nHealtb, Aquatic Life, or Wildlife \nProtectA \nThe AET approach has been designed for use \nin evaluating potential adverse impacts to aquatic \nlife associated with chemical contamination of \nsediments. By empirically determining the associ- \nation between chemical contamination and adverse \nbiotogical effects, predictions can be made regard- \ning the levels of contamination that are always \nassociated with adverse effects (i.e., the AET values). These critical levels of contamination can \nthen be used to develop guidelines for protezthg \naquatic life (e.g., sediment quality values). AETs \ncan be developed for any kind of aquatic organism \nfor which biological responses to chemical toxicity \ncan be measured. The protectiveness of the AET \ncan therefore be ensured by evaluating organisms \nand biological responses with different degrees of \nsensitivity to chemical toxicity. For example, \nevaluations of metabolic changes (i.e., usually a \nvery sensitive biological response) in a pollution- \nsensitive species would likely result in AET \nvalues that are lower and more protective than \nevaluations of mortality (i.e., generally a less \nsensitive response) in a more pollution-tolerant \nspecies. The protectiveness of AETs am also be \nensured through the application of \u201csafety factors.\u201d \nFor example, to be protective of chronic biological \nresponses, a factor based on an acute-chronic ratio \ncould be applied to AETs developed on the basis \nof acute biological responses. \n11.23 Ability of Method to Generate \nNumerical Critcrla for Speclfk \nCbemicds \nThe AI3 approach is not intrinsically limited irt \napplication to specific chemicals or chemical groups. \nIn general, the approach can be used for dremicals \nfor which data are available. However, when using \na specific data set to generate AETs, it is preferable \nthat AT3 generation be limited to chemicals with \nwide concentration ranges (e.g., ranging from \nreference concentrations to concentrationsnear direct \nsources) and/or with appropriate detection frequen- \ntits (e.g., greater than 10 detections). A partial list \nof chemicals for which AETs have been developed \nis presented in Table 11-l. \n113 USEFULNESS \n113.1 Env&onmcatal AppUcabUity \n113.1.1 S&w for Di$erent Sediment 7)pes \n\u2018Ilte AET approach can be applied to any \nsediment type in saltwater or freshwater environ- \nments for which biological tests can be conducted. \nII-AET Approach \nTable 11-l.

In practice, identification of unique or \natypical sediment matrices is important in deter- \nmining the general applicability of ALIT values \ngenerated from a specific set of data. \nDifferences in physical characteristics (e.g., \ngrain size, habitat exposure) are one major factor \nthat may amount for stations not meeting predic- \ntions based on existing AET values. In Puget \nSound studies, for example, fine-grainedsediments dominated stations that bad significant amphipod \nmortality that had not been predicted, and coarse- \ngrained sediments dominated stations that had \nsignificant depressions in benthic infauna that had \nnot been predicted by benthic AETs (Barrick et \nal., 1988). \n11.3.1.2 Suitability for Different Chnica1.s or \nClasses of Chemicals \nThere are no constraints on the types of \nchemicals for which AETs can be developed. An \nAET can be developed for any measured cfremicai \n11-9 \nSediment CZass+i&m Methods Compendium \n(organic or inorganic) that spans a wide-concentra- \ntion range in the data set used to generate ARTS. \nThe availability of a wide diversity of chemical \ndata increases the probability that toxic agents (or \nchemicals that covary in the environment with \ntoxic agents) can be included in interpreting \nobserved biological impacts. \nTo date, ARTS have been developed for over \n60 chemicals frquently detected in the environ- \nment, including 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocar- \nbons (PA%); several alkylated PAHs and related \nnitrogen-, sulfur-, and oxygen-containing hetero- \ncycles; polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (reported \nas total PCBs); 5 chlorinated benzenes; 6 phthalate \nesters; 3 chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides; \nphenol and 4 alkyl-substituted and chlorinated \nphenols; 10 metals and metalloids, 3 volatile \norganic compounds; and 5 misce.llaneous extract- \nable substances. Data for other miscellaneous \nchemicals that were less frequently detected or \nanalyzed for in the Puget Sound area were also \nevaluated for their potential use in developing \nARTS (e.g., resin acids and chlorinated phenols in \nselected sediments from areas influenced by pulp \nand paper mill activity). \nARTS have been developed for chemical \nconcentrations normalized to sediment dry weight \nand sediment organic carbon content (expressed as \npercent of dry weight sediment). Using a 188- \nsample data set from Puget Sound, ARTS were \nalso developed for data normalized to fine-grained \nparticle content (expressed as the percent of silt \nand clay, or <63-urn particulate material, in dry \nweight of sediment). These latter ART values did \nnot appear to offer advantages in predictive reli- \nability over the more commonly used dry weight \nand TOC normalizations (Beller ef al., 1986). \n11.3.1.3 Suitability for Predicting Eficts on \nDifferent Organisms \nThe AET approach can be used to predict \neffects on any life stage of any marine or aquatic \norganism for which a biological response to \nchemical toxicity can be determined. Because the \napproach is empirical, relying on direct measure- \nment of the chemical concentrations associated \nwith samples exhibiting adverse effects, the results are directly applicable to predicting effeds on the \norganisms used to generate the AET. \u2018Ihe results \ncan also be used to predict effects on nontarget \norganisms by ensuring that the organisms used to \ngenerate an ART are either representative of the \nnontarget organisms or are more sensitive to \nchemical toxicity than those organisms. For \nexample, ARTS generated for a species of sensi- \ntive amphipod might be considered as protective \nof the chemical concentrations associated with \nadverse effects in other species of equally or less \nsensitive amphipods. At the same time, these \nART might be considered protective of most other \nbenthic macroinvertebrate taxa because they are \nbased on a member of a benthic taxon (i.e., \nAmphipoda) that is considered to be sensitive to \nchemical toxicity (Bellan-Santini, 1980). By \ncontrast, AETs generated for a pollution-tolerant \nspecies such as the polychaete Capitella capitata \n(cf. Pearson and Rosenberg, 1978) might be \nconsidered representative for other pollution- \ntolerant species, but not protective for most other \nkinds of benthic macroinvertebrates. \n1 l-3.1.4 Suitability for In-Place Pollutant Control \nIn remedial action programs, assessment tools \nsuch as the ART approach can be used to address \nthe following specific regulatory needs: \nProvide a preponderance of evidence for \nnarrowing a list of problem chemicals \nmeasured at a site; \nProvide a predictive tool for cases in \nwbicb site-specific biological testing \nresults are not available; \nEnable designation of problem areas \nwithin the site; \nRovide a consistent basis on whi& to \nevaluate sediment contamination and to \nseparate acceptable from unacceptabk \nCOditiOflS; \nProvide an environmental basis for trig- \ngering sediment remedial action; and \nII-10 \nII-AET Approach \n8 Provide a reference point for establishing \na cleanup goal. \nBecause AET va!ues are derived from sediments \nwith multiple contaminants, they incorporate the \ninfluence of interactive effects in environmental \nsamples. The ability to incorporate the influences \nof chemical mixtures, either by design or default, \nis an advantage for the assessment of in-place \npOllUtantS. \n11.3.1.5 Suitability for Source Control \nThe AET approach is well suited for identify- \ning problem areas. Because specific cause-effect \nrelationships are not proven for specific chemicals \nand biological effects, remedial actions should not \nbe designed exclusively for a specific chemical. \n(This caution applies to all approaches because of \nthe complex mixture of contaminants in environ- \nmental samples.) The link between problem areas \nand potential sources of contamination is estab- \nlished by analysis of concentration gradients of \ncontaminants in these problem areas and the \npresence and composition of contaminants in \nsediments and source materials. The AET ap- \nproach provides a means of narrowing the list of \nmeasured chemicals that should be considered for \nsource control and provides supportive evidence. \nfor eliminating chemicals from consideralion that \nappear to be present at a concentration too low to \nbe associated with adverse biological effects. \nReduction of the overall contaminant load to a \nproblem area such that all measured chemicals are \nbelow their respective AETs is predicted to result \nin mitigation of the adverse biological effects. It \nis possible that such source controls may be \neffective because of the concomitant removal of \nan unmeasured contaminant. \nI I.3. I.6 Suitability for Disposal Applications \nThe evaluation of potential biological impacts \nassociated with the disposal of dredged material is \nan important component in the designation of \ndisposal sites and review of disposal permits for \ndredged material. AET values provide a prepon- \ndcrance of evidence in determining a \u201creason to believe\u201d that sediment contamination could result \nin adverse biological effects. Hence, the AET \napproach is a useful tool for assessing the need for \nbiological testing during the evaluation of disposal \nalternatives. It is assumed that ABI values \ngenerated for in-place sediments provide a useful \nprediction of whether adverse biological effects \nwill occur in dredged material after disposal at \naquatic sites. \n113.2 General Advantages and Umitations \n11.3.2.X Ease of Use \nIn this section, \u201cuse\u201d is treated as both genera- \ntion and application. The ease of generating AET \nvalues depends on the status of the data to be used \nfor AET generation (i.e., whether field data have \nbeen collected and whether statistical significance \nhas been determined for biological indicators). It \nis recommended that a search for existing data be \nconducted as part of determining the need for \ncollecting new samples. The existing database of \nmatched biological and chemical data from Puget \nSound comprises over 300 samples. Collection of \nnew field data (e.g., for application outside of \nPuget Sound) would require a considerable expen- \nditure of effort, as would the statistical analysis of \na large number of samples. However, if data are \navailable and statistical analyses have been per- \nformed, the generation of APT values is very easy \nwith the SEDQUAL database (described in Sec- \ntion 11.2.1.2.4). The menu-driven system allows \nfor a considerable amount of flexibility in choos- \ning stations and biological indicators to be includ- \ned in AET generation. Application of AET (i.e., \ncomparison of ABT values to chemical concentra- \ntions in field samples) is also very easy when \nusing SEDQUAL, provided that the field data \nhave been computerized. Application of AEI\u2019 \nvalues to chemical data presented in existing \nliterature is also straightfonvard. \n11.3.2.2 Relative Cost \nThe cost of developing ABT values can span \na wide range, depending on the stage of database \nSediment CZassif;urtion Methods Compendium \ndevelopment and the numbers and kinds of chemi- \ncals and biological indicators used. The least \ncostly means of developing the values is to use \nexisting chemical and biological information, thus \nminimizing the expenses associated with field \nsampling and laboratory analyses. (Selective \nsampling to confirm whether existing AFT vahtes \nare applicabie would still be useful.) The histori- \ncal database could be based on the pooled results \nfrom various studies conducted in a region, pro- \nviding that each study passed QAfQC performance \ncriteria and satisfied the prerequisites of the AET \napproach (e.g., matched chemical and biological \nmeasurements and the ability to discriminate \nadverse biological effects). \nIf the historical database is judged inadequate \nto generate AETs for a region, then the costs of \nfield measurements of chemical concentrations in \nsediments and associated biological effects must \nbe incurred to develop the database. These costs \ncan vary substantially, depending on the chemicals \nand biological indicators evaluated. Costs would \nbe minimized if evaluations were based on a \nlimited range of chemicals and a single, inexpen- \nsive biological test. It is recommended that the \napproach be based on a relatively wide range of \nchemicals, and if possible, several kinds of biolog- \nical indicators. \nThe existing database for the Puget Sound \nregion is based on a wide range of chemicals (i.e., \nU.S. EPA priority pollutants and other selected \nchemicals) and four kinds of biological indicators. \nThe costs for deveIoping AETs varied consider- \nably among the four indicators. For example, \nlaboratory costs for the least expensive indicator \n(Microtox bioassay) were approximately $200 per \nstation, whereas costs for the most expensive \nindicator (abundances of benthic macroinverte- \nbrates) were as high as $1,800 per station. Tbere- \nfore, within the existing database, the range of \ncosts for biological testing spanned almost 1 order \nof magnitude. \nOnce AET values have been generated, use of \nthese values to predict the occurreact of biological \neffects is relatively inexpensive. Chemicat data \nmay be compared to AFT values by using the \nSEDQUAL database or through manual data \nmanipulations. 1X.3.2.3 Tendbuy to Be Conservative \nThe empirical, field-based nature of &he AFZ \napproach precludes defmitive a priori predictions \nof its tendency to be either over- or underprotec- \ntive of the environment. The occurrence of \nbiologically impacted stations at concentrations \nbelow the AET of a given chemical (see Figure \n11-1) may appear to be underprotective. Howev- \ner, the occurreo& of impacfed stations at concert- \ntrations below the AFT of a single chemical does \nnot imply that AETs in general are not potective \nagainst biological effects, only that single chemi- \ncals may not account for all stations with biologi- \ncal effects. If AETs are developed for multiple \nchemicals, the approach can account for a high \npercentage of stations with adverse biological \neffects. \nTo date, AlXs have been developed for acute \nsediment bioassays of mortality in adult am- \nphipocls, developmental abnormality in larval \nbivalves, and metabolic alterations in bacteria. All \nof these organism/endpoint combinations are \nconsidered to be sensitive to chemical toxicity. \nAETs have also been generated for in sir~ reduc- \ntions in the abundances of benthic maao- \ninvertebrates. Because these reductions incapo- \nrate chronic (i.e., long-term) exposure to contami- \nnants, they can also be considered as sensitive \nmeasures of the effects of chemical toxicity. \nHowever, a more protective approach would be to \nuse tbe lowest of the four kinds of AFT for each \nchemical as the concentration on which predic- \ntions are made. Alternatively, the protectiveness \nof any kind of AFT could be modified by devel- \noping sediment quality values based on \u201csafety \nfactors\u201d applied to existing AETs. \n11.3.2.4 Lewd of Acceptance \nThe AFT approach has been accepted by \nseveral federal and state agencies in the Puget \nSound region as one tool in providing guidelines \nfor regulatory decisions. U.S. EPA has used AEI\u2019 \nvalues to develop sediment quality values with \nwhich to evaluate the potential toxicity of amtam- \nmated sediments in urban bays. PSDDA has used \nAET values as n tc& to develop chemical guide- \n1 I-AET Approach \nlines for determining whether biological testing is \nnecessary for dredged sediments proposed for \nunconfined, open-water disposal. Ecology has \nused AET to develop sediment management \nstandards. These standards were promulgated by \nthe State of Washington and approved by EPA \nRegion X in 1991. The standards are being used \nby a number of water quality programs (e.g., \nsource control, remediation). \nSeveral major characteristics influence the \nacceptability of the AET approach. The most \nattractive characteristic of the approach is ptoba- \nbly the reliance on empirical information based on \nfield-collected sediments or indigenous organisms, \nand exposure of laboratory test organisms to \nenvironmental samples. A second attractive \nfeature of the approach is the setting of an AET at \nthe chemical concentration in the data set above \nwhich adverse biological effects are always ob- \nserved. This characteristic provides consistency \nthat, with a representative database used to gener- \nate AETs, enhances the preponderance of evidence \nof adverse effects in the environment. The AET \nvalues can be updated as new information is \ncollected The AET approach can also be applied \nto an existing database in new regions, providing \ncertain prerequisites are met by the database (e.g., \nsynoptic measurement of chemical and biological \ndata, and QA/QC guidelines). \nA limitation of the AET approach is that \nfield-based approaches do not directly assess \ncause-effect relationships. Because sediments in \nthe environment are often contaminated with a \ncomplex mixture of chemicals, it is difficult when \nusing field-collected sediment for any approach to \nrelate observed biological effects to a single \nchemical. The approach also requires selection of \nappropriate normalized chemical data to address \nthe bioavailability of contaminants to organisms. \nOrganic carbon notmalization may be most appro- \npriate for nonpolar organic contaminants based on \ntheoretical considerations. In addition, nonprotec- \ntive AETs could be generated if unusual matrices \n(e.g., slag) that anomalously restrict bioavailability \nare included in the database used to generate the \nAETs, or if biological test results are incorrectly \nclassified. Recommended data treatment guide- \nlines for chemical and biological data are dis- cussed by Barrick et al. (1988). The AET ap \npreach was reviewed by the U.S. EPA Science \nAdvisory Board (SAB, 1989), which noted the \nmethod had \u201cmajor strengths in its ability to \ndetermine biological effects and assess interactive \nchemical effects.\u201d \n11.3.2.5 Ability to Be Implemented by \nLaboratories with 7\u2019ypical EquipmeW \nand Handling Facilities \nIf applicable data do not already exist, the \ndevelopment of AET values requires a relatively \nextensive amount of field sampling and laboratory \nanalysis. The chemical analyses required for \ndevelopment of AET represent standard analytical \nprocedures. A laboratory with appropriately \ntrained staff should be able to conduct the neces- \nsary benthic community analyses and sediment \nbioassays. Specific methods for performing the \nchemical and biological tests that were used to \ndevelop Puget Sound ABT are detailed in the \nPuget Sound Protocols (Tetra Tech, 1986). These \nefforts can be minimized by using historical data \nwhenever posstble. Once AETs are developed, \ntheir routine implementation is relatively easy. In \naddition, they can be easily updated as additional \ndata become available. \n11.3.2.6 Level of Effort Required to Generate \nReWh \nAs noted in Section 11.3.2.1, the SEDQUAL \ndatabase facilitates AET generation and applica- \ntion. After field data have been collected, the \nmost time-consuming task is data entry and \nverification. Entry of chemical and biological data \nfor 50 samples requires roughly 16 person-hours \n(assuming 75 chemicals have been measured and \nbiological effects are being coded simply as \n\u201cimpacted\u201d ot \u201cnonimpaded\u201d). Generating a set \nof AET values for a given biological indicator, 75 \nchemicals, and 50 stations takes approximately \n0.751 h of computer time on SEDQUAL (and \nabout 5 min of labor to set up the analysis). To \ncompare a set of AET (for 75 chemicals) to a SO- \nsample set of field data takes approximately 0.5 \n0.75 h of computer time on SEDQUAL (and \n21-13 \nSedimmt Ciassi&&on Methods Compendium \nroughly 5 mia of labor to set up the analysis). \nSEDQUAL is capable of comparing any kind of \nchemical sediment aiteria to field data, but re- \nquires that the numerical criteria be entered in the \ndatabase. \n11.3.2.7 Degree to which Results Lend \nThemselves to Interpretation \nThe manner in which the AET approach can \nbe used to interpret matched biological and chemi- \ncal data from field-collected sediments is de- \nscribed in Section 112.1. As noted previously, \nthe use of AET can help investigators eliminate \nchemicals from further consideration (as the cause \nof an observed effect); however, the approach \ncannot identify specific cause-effect relationships. \nBecause the AET approach is empirical, it is not \nwell suited to identifying specitic toxic agents or \nelucidating mechanisms of biological uptake and \nmetabolism. However, certain general relalion- \nships could be examined on an a posteriori basis \nwith the AET approach (e.g., testing the relative \nimportance of different ways of normalizing \nchemical concentration data in predicting adverse \nbiological effects). \nA number of environmental factors may \ncomplicate the interpretation of the data. Al- \nthough the AET concept is simple, the generation \nof AET values based on environmental data \nincorporates many complex biological-chemical \ninterrelationships. For example, the AET ap- \nproach incorporates the net effects of the follow- \ning factors that may be important in fieldcollected \nsediments: \nn Interactive effects of chemicals (e.g., \nsynergism, antagonism, and additivity); \nn Unmeasured chemicals and other unmea- \nsured, potentially adverse variables; and \nw Matrix effects and bioavailability (i.e., \nphase associations between contaminants \nand sediments that affect bioavailability of \nthe contaminants, such as the incorpora- \ntion of PAH in soot particles). \n\u2018fbe AET approach cannot quantify the indi- \nvidual contributions of interactive effects, unmea- sured chemicals, or matrix effects in environmen- \ntal samples, but AET values may be influenced by \nthese factors. AET values are expected to be \nreliable predictors of adverse effects that could \nresult from the influence of these environmental \nfactors if the samples used to generate AETs are \nrepresentative of samples for which AET predic- \ntions are made. Alternatively, isolated occurrenc- \nes of such environmental factors in a data set used \nto generate AETs may limit the predictive reliabil- \nity of those AET values. If confounding environ- \nmental factors render the AET approach unreli- \nable, then this should be evident from validation \ntests in which biological effects are predicted in \nadual environmental samples. \nA more detailed discussion of the interpreta- \ntion of AETs and the confounding effects of \nenvironmental factors is presented in U.S. EPA \n(1988). \n11.3.2.8 Degree of Environmental Applicability \nThe AEIT approach has a high degree of \nenvironmental applicability based on its reliance \non chemical and biological measurements made \ndirectly on environmental samples. Such infor- \nmation provides tangible evidence that various \nchemical conceatralions either are or are not \nassociated with adverse biological effects in \ntypically complex environmental settings. \nThe environmental applicability of the AET \napproach has been quantified for the four kinds of \nAET developed for Puget Sound by evaluating the \nreliability with which each kind of AET predicted \nthe presence or absence of adverse biological \neffects in field samples collected from Puget \nSound (USEPA, 1988). The overall reliabiiity of \nthe four tests ranged from 85 to 96 percent, \nindicating that all four kinds of AITs were rela- \ntively accurate at predicting the prez3ence or \nabsence of effects for samples from the existing \ndatabase. This high level of reliability suggests \nthat AETs have a relatively high degree of envi- \nronmental applicability in Puget Sound, and it has \nbeen a primary factor in the use of the AET\u2019 \napproach by agencies in the Puget Sound ~&OIL \nAET values generated for Puget Sound have also \nbeen used as examples of effects-based sediment \n11-74 \nII-AET Appach \ncriteria to provide an initial estimate of the magni- \ntude of potential problem areas in coastal regions \nof the United States for the U.S. EPA Office of \nPolicy Analysis (PTI, 1987). \n11.3.2.9 Degree of Accuracy and Precision \nIn this section, accuracy is considered to be \nthe ability of AET to predict biological effects and \nprecision represents the expected variability \n(uncertainty range) for a given AET value for a \ngiven data set. \nIn previous evaluations of the AET approach \nand other sediment quality values using field- \ncollected data, the accuracy of the approach was \ndefined by two qualities: \nl Sensitivity in detecting environmental \nproblems (i.e., are all biologically impact- \ned sediments identified by the predictions \nof the chemical sediment criteria?) \nl Efficiency in screening environmental \nproblems (i.e., are only biologically im- \npacted sediments identified by the predic- \ntions of the chemical sediment criteria?). \nSensitivity is defined as the proportion of all \nstations exhibiting adverse biological effects that \nare correctly predicted using sediment criteria. \nEfficiency is defined as the proportion of all \nstations predicted to have adverse biological \neffects that actually are impacted. Ideally, a \nsediment criteria approach should be efftcient as \nwell as sensitive. For example, a sediment criteria \napproach that sets values for a wide range of \nchemicals near their analytical detection limits will \nlikely be conservative (i.e., sensitive) but ineffi- \ncient. That is, it will predict a large percentage of \nsediments with biological effects. It will also \npredict impacts at many stations where there are \nno biological effects, but chemical concentrations \nare slightly elevated. The concepts of sensitivity \nand efficiency are illustrated in Figure 11-2. \nThe overall reliability of any sediment criteria \napproach addresses both sensitivity and efficiency. \nThis measure is defined as the proportion of all \nstations for which correct predictions were made for either the presence or absence of adverse \nbiological effects: \nHigh reliability results from correct prediction of \na large percentage of the impacted stations (i.e., \nhigh sensitivity, few false negatives) and correct \nprediction of a large percentage of the non- \nimpacted stalions (i.e., high efficiency, few false \npositives). An assessment of AET reliability was \nrecently conducted using a large database compris- \ning samples from 13 Fuget Sound embayments \n(Barrick et al., 1988). These evaluations suggest \nthat the AET approach is relatively sensitive for \nthe biological indicators tested and also relatively \nefficient. For example, 68-83 percent sensitivity \nand 55-75 percent efficiency were observed when \nAETs generated from a 188-sample data set were \nevaluated with an independent 146-sample data \nset. The ranges of sensitivity and efficiency cited \nabove represent the ability of benthic infaunal \nAET values to predict statistically significant \ndepressions in the abundances of benthic infauna \nin field-collected samples and the ability of am- \nphipod mortality bioassay AET values to predict \nstatistically significant mortality in bioassays \nconducted on field-collected sediment. \nPrecision of the AET approach has not been \nas intensively investigated as accuracy. AET \nvalues are the result of parametric statistical \nprocedures (i.e., determination of the significance \nof biological effects relative to reference condi- \ntions) and nonparametric methods (e.g., ranking of \nstations by concentration), and thus are not amena- \nble to the routine definition of confidence inter- \nvals. However, the degree of AET precision is \nconsidered to depend on the following factors: \nn \u2018Ibe concentration range between the AEl\u201d \n(determined by a nonimpacted station) \nand the next highest concentration that is \nassociated with a statistically significant \neffed; \nI aassification error associated with the \nstatistical significance of biological indi- \n21-15 \nS&nent Chassftition Methods Compendium \nIMPACTED \nCORREClLY PREDICTED PREDICTED \nSENSITIVITY = C/B x 100 = 5/8 x 100 = 63% \nEFFICIENCY = C/A x 100 = 5/7 x 100 = 71% \nFOR A GIVEN BIOLOGICAL INDIMTOR: \nA AK STATIONS PREDICTED TO BE IMPACTED \nB ALL STATIONS KNOWN TO BE IMPACTED \nC AU STATIONS CORRECTLY PREDICTED TO BE IMPACTED \nFigure 1 l-2. Measures of reliability (sensitivity and efhlency). \ncator results (i.e., whether a station is \nproperly classified as impacted or non- \nimpacted, as related to Type I and Type II \nstatistical error); \nm The weight of evidence or number of \nobservations supporting a given AET \nvalue; and \nl Tke analytical error associated with quan- \ntification of chemical results. \nDetailed discussion of these factors is provided in \nBeller et al. (1986). One approach used in Puget Sound to estimate \nthe uncertainty range around the AET value was \nto define the lower limit as the concentration at \nthe nonimpacted station immediately below the \nAT3 and to define the upper limit as the concen- \ntration at the impacted station immediately above \nthe AET. These limits are based largely on \nprobabilities of statistical classification error. For \ndata sets with large concentration gaps between \nstations, such uncertainty ranges will be wider and \nprecision will be poorer than for data sets titb \nmore continuous distributions. \u2018Ike number of \n1 I-AET Approach \nstations used to establish an AET would be ex- \npected to have a marked effect on AET uncertain- \nty because small data sets would tend to have less \ncoalinuous distributions of chemical concentra- \ntions than large data sets. Based on analyses \nconducted with Puget Sound data, the magnitude \nof the AET uncertainty for 10 chemicals or chemi- \ncal groups that are commonty detected is typically \nless than one-third to one-half of the value of the \nAET itself (considering botb amphipod mortality \nbioassay and benthic infaunal AET data). Based \non quality assurance information for these data, \nanalytical error is probably a minor component of \noverall precision, particularly for metals. \n11.4 flA?X'Us \n11.4.1 Extent of Use \nThe AET approach is used by several agencies \nand sediment management programs in the Pacific \nNorthwest to provide guideline values for regula- \ntory decisions. The State of Washington has \ndeveloped sediment management standards primar- \nily using the AET approach but also including \nequilibrium ptiitioning values. These standards \nwere promulgated by the State and approved by \nEPA, Region X, in 1991 and are currently being \nimplemented in a variety of programs. The \nstandards are the culmination of cooperative \nplanning and scientific investigations by several \nfederal and stale agencies throughout the 1980\u2019s, \nincluding: \nm Superfund investigations at Commence- \nment Bay and Eagle Harbor; \nm Puget Sound Dredged Disposal Analysis \n(PSDDA); \nl Urban Bay Toxics Action Program; and \nm Puget Sound Water Quality Authority \nManagement Plan. \nA key result of these efforts has been the rewgni- \ntion by regulators of two separate levels of sedi- ment contamination and has led to tie deuelop- \nment of two sets of sediment quality values. This \nseparation in management use of sediment values \narose from the sensitivity and efficiency concepts \nof reliability previously discussed. This manage- \nment decision was made because it was deter- \nmined that none of the available approaches for \ndeveloping sediment quality values would result in \n100 percent sensitive and 100 percent efficient \nvalues. Different strategies have been used by \ndifferent programs for use of AET-generated \nvalues. In general, the lowest AET (termed \nLAET) for any of the biological tests is used to \nestablish the lower level where there is little \nconcern of se&men1 contamination (e.g., Ibe goal \nfor remedial actions). The AET approach has \ndeveloped higher chemical levels (termed m, \nabove which adverse effects are predicted for all \nthe biological tests. In most regulatory programs, \ndirect biological testing is allowed to resolve the \ndifferences in predictions of t&e two sets of \nsediment quality values (Le., prediction of adverse \nbiological effect by highly sensitive sediment \nquality values, which at lower chemical concentra- \ntions are not predicted by highly efficient sedi- \nment quality values). To date, such sediment \nquality values developed were for and used in \nmarine and estuarine environments. The State of \nWashington and EPA, Region X, are gathering \nchemical and biological data to potentially develop \ncompanion values for freshwater sediments. \nOther efforts are under way outside Puget \nSound and the Pacific Northwest to develop sedi- \nment quality values using the AET approach. mese \ninclude California and the Great Lakes region ia tbe \nUnited States, and the countries of Canada, New \nZealand, and Australia internationally. \n11.4.2 Extent to W&b Approach Has Been \nField-VJidnted \nAs described in U.S. EPA (1988), the reliabili- \nty of AETs generated from Puget Sound data WBS \nevaluated with tests of sensjtivily aad efficieacy \n(defined ia Section 11.329). Tests of tie seusi- \ntivity and efficiency of the AET appsoa& were \ncarried out in several steps, as deskbed below: \nSediment Classficution Methods Contpmdium \nl The chemic8I database was subdivided \ninto groups of stations that were tested for \nthe Same biologic81 effects indicators. \nSpecifically, ali chemistry stations with \nassociated amphipod bioassay data were \ngrouped together (287 stations), all chem- \nistry stations with associated benthic \ninfaunal data were grouped together (201 \nstations), all chemistry stations with asso- \nciated oyster larvae bioassay data were \ngrouped together (56 stations), and all \nchemistry stations with associated Micro \ntox bioassay data were grouped together \n(50 stations). Stations with more than \none biologic81 indicator were included in \neach appropriate group. \nn The stations in each group were classified \n8s impacted or nonimpacted based on the \nappropriate statistical criteria (i.e., F, \nand t-tests at alpha = 0.05). \nn Several tests of reliability were conducted \nat this point: \nl Test 1: AET values (dry weight) \nwere generated with the entire \nl+tget Sound database available in \n1988, and sensitivity and efficiency \ntests were performed against the \nsame database for each biological \nindicator. \nl Test 2: The test described above \nWaS repeated in hV0 park: (8) Using \nT0C-IlO~81iZd liJ?f V81UfZ.S for \nnonionic organic compounds and \ndry weight-normalized AET values \nfor all other compounds (i.e., ioniz- \nable organic compounds, metals, \nand metalloids), and (b) using \nmC-norm8bzed data for 811 chemi- \ncals. Test 2 allowed for oposterio- \nri evaluation of the relative success \nof dry weight and TOC normaiiza- \ntion for nonionic organic chemicals. \nl Test 3: Because the efficiency of \ntie AET based on the entire Puget \nSound database is 100 percent by constraint (as in Tests 1 and 2), \npredictive efficiency was e8timated \nby the following procedure. For \neach biological indicator, a single \nstation WBS sequentially deleted \nfrom the total database, AETs were \nrecalculated for the reumining data \nset, and biologic81 effects were \npredicted for the single deleted \nstation. \u2018Zbe predictive efficiency \nwas the cumulative result for the \nsequential deletions of single sta- \ntions. For example, the 287~sample \ndatabase for amphipod bioassay \nresults cztn be used to provide a \n286~sample independent database \nfor predicting (in sequence) effects \non 811 287 samples. \nl Test 4: In this test, independent \ndata sets were used to generate and \ntest AETs to confirm the sensitivity \nand efficiency me8suremenk in \nTests 1 and 3. AETs (dry weight) \ngenerated with 188 stations from \ndiverse geographic regions in Puget \nSound were tested with a comple \ntely independent set of 146 Fuget \nSound stations. \nIn addition, the influence of geographic \nlocation and other factors on AET predictive \nability were examined (Banick et ol., 1988). \nFurther testing of Pttget Sound AET v8hes using \nmatched biological/chemical data from other \ngeographic areas is desirable before recommend- \ning dire& application of the FItget Sound values in \nother geographic regions. \n11.43 Reasons for Limited Utw \nThe AET approach is being inue8singly used \noutside of Puget Sound and the Pacific Northwest \nto evaluate and compare different classes of \nsediments and to develop bay-, site-, or region- \nspecific sediment quality values for a variety of \nregulatory uses. Because the approach is based on \nempirical data, direct application of values from \nII-AET Approach \nPuget Sound or another area to a specific bay, \nsite, or region usually encounters some conflicting \nor confounding data. Because regional reference \nareaS are used to determine the significance of \nadverse biological effeck in the AET approach, \nthe AET developed for one region may be over- \nprotective or underprotective of the resources in \nthe other area. Additionally, the mix of chemicals \nin one region\u2019s sediments may not be the same in \nanother region. The use of the AFZT approach \nand use of specific AET values should not be con- \nfused. \nDevelopment of site-specific AETs for other \ngeographic areas may require additional sampling. \nBecause many past studies were not multidiscipli- \nnary, measurements were often made only for \nchemistry or biology rather than for both kinds of \ninformation. In such cases, there will be 8 limited \namount of appropriate historical data that can be \nused to develop AETs. The integration or com- \nparison of AET data sets among different regions \ncan also be restricted because appropriate biologi- \ncal indicators for generating AETs may vary \namong regions. \n11.4.4 Outlook for Future Use 8nd Amount of \nDevelopment Yet Needed \nThe following two approaches to AET devel- \nopment could be particularly beneficial in expand- \ning the use of this approach: \nn Use of laboratory cause-effect (spiking) \nstudies to evaluate AET predictions on a \nchemical-specific basis and \nn Use of a large set of matched biological/ \nchemical data from different geographic \nareas to teat the predictive ability of AET \nand to test the \u201cprecision\u201d of AET values \nbased on data sets from different areas. \nThe AET approach was presented to (USEPA, \n1988) and reviewed by tbe U.S. EPA Science \nAdvisory Board (SAB, 1989). The SAB noted \nmajor strengths and limitations of tie method and \nprovided recommendations that would improve the \nvalidity of the AET values. The method was considered to contain sufficient merit for use in \ndeveloping location-specific sediment quality \nvalues. Because of the specificity of the method, \ni.e., the empirical applications at specific locali- \nties, under specific environmental conditions, the \napproach seemed less useful for development of \ngeneral, broadly applicable (i.e., national) sedi- \nment quality criteria. \n11.5 REFERENCES \nBarrick, R.C., S.

An overview of the IJC strategy for \nassessing contaminated sediments is provided in \nthis chapter. However, because it would be \ninappropriate to reproduce all, or substantially all, \nof the document in this chapter, the interested \nreader is referred to the IJC (1988a) document \nitself for an explanation of details that are not \nprovided herein. \n12.1 SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS \n12.1.1 Current Use \nThe IJC (1988a) document is intended as \nguidance for the assessment of contaminated \nsediments in the Great Lakes. Its first application \nis in a work plan for sediment investigations at \nGreat Lakes areas of concern (AOCs, as identified \nby the IJC). Section 118(c)(3) of the Water \nQuality Act of 1987 calls for U.S. EPA\u2019s Great \nLakes National Program Office to survey at least \nfive AOCs as part of a 5-yr study and demon- \nstration program called ARCS (Assessment and \nRemediation of Contaminated Sediments). The \nstrategy recommended by IJC (1988a) will be \napplied through a series of activities involving \nphysical mapping and characterization, sampling, \nchemical analyses, toxicity testing, and in situ \ncommunity analysis. The assessment began in \n1989 and was completed in 1991. The ARCS \nprogram also seeks to improve upon the IJC (1988a) approach by comparing various test \nmethods and by evaluating cost-effective recon- \nnaissance and screening methods. \n12.1.2 Potential Use \nOther AOCs will eventually be evaluated in \nthe process of developing remedial action plans. \nIt is possible that other Great Lakes harbors, \nrivers, and estuaries will be added to the list of \nAOCs, in which case remedial action plans would \nhave to be developed there. In addition, the \nguidance document could potentially be used to \nassess suspected sediment contamination outside \nthe Great Lakes basin. \n12.2 DESCRIPTION \n12.2.1 Description of Method \n12.2.1.1 Objectives and Assumptions \nIn response to the need for a common \napproach to the assessment of contaminated \nsediments, the IJC\u2019s Sediment Subcommittee has \ndeveloped a strategy based on protocols that \nemphasize biological monitoring. The approach \nis intended for use in comprehensive assess- \nments of areas (e.g., bays, harbors, rivers, other \ndepositional zones) where sediment contamina- \ntion and the need for remedial action are sus- \npected. While the suggested strategy attempts to \nminimize the cost and expertise, the assessments \nare relatively large undertakings appropriate to \nsituations where large-scale remedial actions \nmight be contemplated. In such cases, the cost \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \nof conducting accurate assessments would be \njustified if the subsequent remedial options \ncould cost far more than the assessments. It was \nnot the primary intent of the subcommittee to \nprovide guidance for small-scale decision-mak- \ning activities, such as sample-by-sample disposal \nof dredged material from navigation channels. \nNevertheless, some of the component methods \ndescribed could be useful and cost-effective in \nthis regard. The first major assumption, there- \nfore, is that the scope of the study in question is \nsufficient to warrant a large-scale integrated \ninvestigation. \nAnother fundamental assumption is that the \nultimate concern of a problem assessment focus- \nes on whether sediment contaminants are exert- \ning biological stress or are being bioaccumu- \nlated. Accepting this assumption, it follows that \nadequate assessments of sediment quality should \ninvolve components of chemistry, toxicity, and \ninfaunal community structure (Chapman and \nLong 1983), a concept frequently referred to as \nthe Sediment Quality Triad approach (see Chap- \nter 9). The proposed strategy has the following \nobjectives: \nTo provide accurate assessments of spe- \ncific problems by using a modified \n\u2018triad\u201d approach, which integrates chem- \nical, physical, and biological informa- \ntion; \nTo perform tasks in a sequence \nthe results from each technique \nused to reduce subsequent \nling requirements and costs; \nTo provide adequate proof of \nbetween the contamination and \nserved biological impact; \nTo quantify problem severity, so that \ncan be \nsamp- \nlinkage \nthe ob- \nthereby \nenabling intercomparisons between and \nwithin areas of investigation (thus allow- \ning development of a priority list for \nremedial actions and the objective selec- \ntion of appropriate remedial options); \u2022 To consider the effects on different species \nand different trophic levels, since biological \nimpairment may occur in the water column \nand the sediments if resuspension occurs \nand since there is no such thing as the \nuniversal \u201cmost-sensitive species\u201d (Cairns, \n1986). \nThe IJC approach is an integrated strategy that \nprovides the necessary data to identify sediment- \nassociated contamination as the problem source, \nspecify effects, rank problem severity, and assist in \nthe selection of remedial options. While the assess- \nment portion of the document identifies a set of the \nbest currently available assessment tools (see Section \nl2.2.1.2.2), it is assumed that decisions will be made \nbased at the circumstances unique to each AOC \nThere is no substitute for experience (expert judg- \nment), and it is also assumed that appropriate \nexpertise will be assembled before the assessment \nstudy plan is formulated. \n12.2.1.2 Level of Effort \n12.2.1.2.1 Type of Sampling Required \nThe IJC (1988a) approach involves two stages. \nStage I, the initial assessment, is used for areas \nwhere an inadequate or outdated database exists, In \nthe IJC document Stage I is not subdivided, while \nStage II is broken into Phases I, II, III, and IV. \nStage I uses only in situ assessment techniques and \ncriteria: a limited physical description of the area \n(e.g., basin size and shape, bathymetry) and the \nsediments, bulk chemical analyses, resident benthic \ncommunity organization (e.g., family-level identifi- \ncations), fish contaminant body burdens (one impor- \ntant species, selected by expert judgment), and \nexternal abnormalities on collected specimens. Any \none of the following criteria provides sufficient \njustification for proceeding to Stage II: \n\u2022 Concentrations of metals above background \nlevels in sediments; \n\u2022 Concentrations of hazardous persistent \norganic compounds above best available \ndetection levels in sediments; \n12-2 Concentrations of hazardous persistent \norganic compounds above detection levels \nin ftsh or benthos; \nThe absence of a healthy benthic commu- \nnity (e.g., absence of clean water organisms \nsuch as amphipods or mayflies, presence of \na community dominated by oligochaetes, \nthe complete absence of invertebrates); and \nPresence of extental abnormalities in f&h. \nThese conditions must be supported by evidence \nthat the observed situation is not due to a major \nsediment perturbation, such as dredging or substrate \nmodilication. \nAvailable data may preclude the need for a \nStage I assessment. The cost and effort that Stage I \nentails should be avoided if there is already strong \nevidence of a contamination problem. \nWhen a probable sediment contamination \nproblem is identified, either through the initial \nassessment or from the examination of existing data, \nthen Stage 11, the detailed assessment, should be \nundertaken. llbe detailed assessment consists of \nfour phases, which together define the sediment \nproblem in the most costeffective manner. The \nphases are not inflexible protocols, but rather logical \ngroupings of work units. The expert invesligator \nshould be responsible for the final study design. \nln Phase I of Stage Il, extensive information on \nthe physical composition of the sediments is collect- \ned. These data are used to define areas or zones of \nhomogeneity within a study area. Knowledge of \nthese zones allows sampling requirements for \nPhase II to be estimated. \nIn Phase II of Stage II, the benthic community \nstructure is examined to the lowest possible taxo- \nnomic level (e.g., species or variety), along with the \nsurlicial sediment chemistry (e.g., pH, total organic \ncarbon, redox potential, metals, extractable organic \ncompounds). Phase Il results can be combined with \nPhase 1 data to reduce the sampling effort in the \nnext phase. \nIn Phase Ill of Stage II, a battery of laboratory \nbioassays (e.g., Miuotox, algal, daphnid, benthic \ninvertebrate, fii, Ames test) are performed on a smaller number of sediment samples than those in \nthe Phase Ii sample set. Since fresh sediment must \nbe collected for this phase, precision position-f-g \nequipment is required to relocate previously sampled \nsites. Phase III costs can be reduced by performing \nacute lethality bioassays on a sediment sample \nbefore proceeding to tests that measure chronic or \nsublethal effects. Also in Phase III, sediment cores \nare wlleded, dated, and sectioned for stratified \nchemical analyses and bioassays. Finally, adult fish \nare examined histopathologically for internal (e.g., \nliver) tumors. In relatively confined geographical \nareas, Phases Ii and III may be combined becam \nfurther sampling may be more ccstly than condud- \ning additional bioassays and relocating Phase Il sets \nfor Phase III sampling may be difficult. In this \ncase, phase II sampling will include extra material \nfor Phase m. \nIn the fourth and fmal phase of Stage II sedi- \nment dynamics (e.g., accumulation, resuspension, \nmovement) and factors affecting them are quanti- \nlied. All of the foregoing information is necessary \nfor the selection of appropriate remedial options \nFor example, depositional history, as revealed by \nsampling sediment cores, and sediment dynamicsare \ncritical pieces of information in the selection and \ncost evaluation of remedial options. \nOitexia that clearly indicate when some form of \nremedial action must be considered (based on the \nresults of Stage II) am essential. Because of the \nabsence of definitive sediment action criteria at time \nof writing, the criteria proposed by the UC (19&3a) \nare highly conservative, following the language of \nthe 1978 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement as \ntevised in 1987 (especially Annexes 1 and 12), in \norder to promote maximum protection and effective \nrestoration of the Great Lakes ecosystem. The UC \n(1988a) urges that these criteria be reviewed regu- \nlady to ensure that they continue to fulfill their \nintendedputpose. \n12212.2 Methods \nDuring Stage & the minimum amount of infor- \nmation necessary to amess potential problem sedi- \nments is collected. A variety of physical, chemical, \nand biological measurements are recommended, as \noutlined below \n12-3 \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \nn A geographical description of the area and \nits bathymetry is required. \nSediment grain size - Size analysis tecb- \nniques based on settling velocity (Ameri- \ncan Society for Testing and Materials, \n1964; Duncan and IaHaie, 1979) are re- \ncommended. The sand fraction is re- \nmoved by a 62-,um sieve and analyzed \nseparately from the fine-grained material. \nSediment water content - The water content \ncan be determined during sample prepara- \ntion for grain size and other analyses by \ncomparison of sample weights before and \nafter either freeze-drying or oven-drying \n(Adams et al., 1980). \nRedox potential (Eh) and pH should be \nmeasured [specific methods are not rec- \nommended by IJC (1988a)J. \nOrganic carbon - It is recommended that \ntotal sediment organic carbon be measured \nas descrii by Plumb (1981). \nphosphorus - tie measurements are sug- \ngested: total phosphorus, as extracted from \nsediment by sodium carbonate fusion or by \nperchloric acid digestion, and bioavailable \nphosphorus, as estimated by NaOH extract- \nable phosphorus (Williams et al., 1980). \nTen metals (lead, nickel, copper, zinc, \ncadmium, chromium, iron, manganese, \nmercury, and arsenic) are recommended for \nroutine analysis at Great Iakes AOCs. \nAdditional metal analyses are left to the \njudgment of the investigator. &I extraction \nprocedure using a mix of hydrochloric and \nnitric acids (1: 1) is suggested (Plumb, \n198 1). \nPersistent organic compounds - The reader \nis referred to the U.S. EPA (1984) proto- \ncols for broad scans and analyses of indi- \nvidual compounds. When the strategy was \nwritten, no standardized chemical protocols for estimating bioavailability of trace organ- \nic compounds were identified. \nl External abnormalities in ftih - \u2018Ihe pres- \nence of one or more external abnormalities \nis often indicative of anthropogenically \ninduced stress or damage. In the case of \nthe brown bullhead, Ictakcrus nebukwus, \nphenomena such as stubbed barbels, skin \ndiscoloration (melanoma), and skin tumors \nare highly correlated with liver cancer \nincidence (Smith et oi., 1988). It is recom- \nmended that locally occuning Gall (par- \nticularly I. nebukxw) be examined for \ntumors, melanoma, blindneq and barbel \nabnormalities during a Stage I assessment. \nn Contaminant body burdens - The bent& \ninfauna are in continuous contact with the \nsediments, providing a direct measure of \nthe specific relationship between local&d \nsediment contaminant concentrations and \nbioavaiIability. Cup are also regularly in \ncontact with and ingest large quantities of \nsediments. Tbey represent a larger spatial \nand temporal integration of contaminants \nthan do the benthic infauna. Colledion of \nadult common carp (Cyprinur carpi for \ntissue residue analysis is recommended. \nThree to five fEb per replicate should be \ncornposited. The number of replicates is \ndetermined using variability estimates from \nmonitoring programs (Schmitt et al., 1983) \nand a chosen level of precision, to calculate \nan idealized sample size @. 247, Sokal and \nRohlf, 1%9). It is also recommended that \nthe most abundant benthic invertebrate \nspecies (often oligochaete worms in am- \ntaminated sediments) be sampled in early \nsumma, prior to thermal stratification. \nStandard U.S. EPA methods are suggested \nfor tissue residue analysis. The problem of \nobtaining enough biomass for analysis (at \nleast1g)istecognized. \nl Benthic community structure - In a \nStage I assessment, a preliminary analysis \nof community structure impairment is \n12-4 \nrecommended. A qualitative study with \nminimal replication and identification only \nto the family level is suggested. Because \nit is important that rare taxa be sampled, \nsimple techniques tbat employ inexpen- \nsive equipment but take large samples are \nrecommended. This approach should \nsuffice to identify the existence of a \nstressed community for the purposes of \nStage I criteria (see Section 12.2.1.2.1 \nabove). \nPhase II of the detailed assessment consists of \nmore focused analyses to supplement or complement \ninformation obtained in Stage I. Phase I of the \ndetailed assessment focuses on physical mapping of \nthe environment. Ihe most important aspect of the \nphysical assessment of a suspected contaminated \nsediment deposit is its threediiensional mapping. \nA rectangular grid pattern is rt-zommendecl for the \ninitial mapping operation. Concurrent with bottom \nsampling at grid intersections, echo-sounder and \nside-scan sonar surveys should be performed to \nimprove spatial resolution of sediment zones and \nbottom features. Detailed surveys should include \npiston coring for stratigraphic resolution. The grid \nsampling results should be examined using cluster \nanalysis (or similar techniques), which are easy to \ninterpret and functional with a small number of \nvariables. Basic information required in this phase \nincludes geographic location, area1 extent, thickness \nand total sediment volume, average depths of \noverlying water, and the grain size properties of the \ndeposit. Phase 1 results are used to select sampling \nsites for later phases. \nPhase II of the detailed assessment focuses on \nsurficial sediment chemistry and benthic community \nstructure. Based on the previous mapping of homo- \ngeneous zones (Phase I), effort in Wase II can be \nexpended in depositional areas and in those areas \nwith fine-grained sediments. Surflcial chemistry \nsampling should be coincident with the sampling for \ndetailed benthic community structure analysis. Total \norganic carbon, redox potential, pH, metals, and \npersistent organics should be measured. Investiga- \ntors are referred to Plumb (Ml), Williams et OL \n(1980), and U.S. EPA (1984) for collection and \nanalysis methods. Since the main objective of Stage Il commu- \nnity structure assessment is to examine subtle \ndistinctions in stress response, more detailed \ntaxonomic data are required in this phase than \nwere required in Stage I. In the study design and \nsample collection steps, investigators are urged to \nfollow lhe 10 principles of sampling set forth by \nGreen (1979). Further guidance is given in Elliott \n(1977) for critical factors such as site selection, \nsample numbers, sampling design, and data anaiy- \nse& To help investigators assess community \nimpact, IJC (1988a) provides a partial list of \nliterature descriptions of normal nearshore com- \nmunities in habitats that most closely approximate \nGreat Lakes AOCs. A detailed discussion of \nstatistical methods is also included. \nPhase III of the detailed (Stage II) assessment \nconsists of obtaining additional information con- \ncerning sediment toxicity (i.e., bioassays and fish \nhistopathology) and stratigraphic characterization \nof sediment cores. A suite of bioassays is pro- \nposed for toxicological evaluation of sediments: \nMicrotox - an acute, liquid-phase (eiu- \ntriate or pore-water) teat with luminescent \nbacteria (Bulich, 1984); \nAlgal photosynthesis - an acute, liquid- \nphase test using natural communities \n[algal fractionation bioassay (Munawar \nand Munawar, 1987)l or the laboratory \nspecies Selenasr?run cupricomutum (Ross \net al., 1988); \nZooplankton life-cycle tests (Duphniu \nmagna liquid and solid phases) monitor- \ning growth and reproduction (Nebeker et \nal., 1984; LBlanc and Surprenanf 1985); \nChronic, solid-phase tests using the ben- \nthic invertebrates Chironomus tentons \n(Nebeker et ul., 1984), Hyulellu uztecu \n(Nebeker et al., 1984), or Wexugenio \nlimbutu (Maiueg et al., 1983); \nA solid-phase fish bioaccumulation test \nwith the fathead minnow Pimephalcs \npromelas (Mac et al., 1984) \n12-5 \nSediment Classi&ztion Methods Compendium \nm The liquid-phase (extract) Ames Suiino- \nneflalmicrosome assay, a bacterial muta- \ngenicity test (Termant et al., 1987). \nIn addition to bioassays, histopathological exami- \nnations of indigenous adult ftih (especially Icto- \nlurus nebdosus), focusing on preneoplastic and \nneoplastic liver lesions (Couch and- Harshbarger, \n1985), are recommended. \nAlso included in Phase Ill (Stage lI) work are \nchemical analyses and dating of sediment cores. \nIsotopic (\u201cc 9b, UFe, l\u201d(s) and biostratigraphic \n[i.e., ragweed (Ambrosia) pollen] methods are both \nrecommended for dating sediment cores. This \ndating is necessary to establish the threedimen- \nsional configuration of the contaminated sediment \nmass and to assign a date to the sediment deposi- \ntional unit. \nIn Phase IV (Stage II) of the detailed assess- \nment, studies on sediment dynamics are necessary \nto determine the following: \nU Potential water column impacts through \nresuspension; \nn Movement of contaminated sediment out \nof the AOC; \nn The quality and rate of new sediment \naccumulation; and \nw Vertical and horizontal redistribution of \nsediments and their contaminant burdens \nwithin an AOC \nThis information is essential for the development \nand evaluation of a remediation plan. In the \nabsence of practical predictive models, suspended \nsediment characterization (Poulton, 1987), shear \nstrength measurements (Tenaghi and Peck, 1%7), \nand resuspension studies (Tsai and Lick, 1986) are \nrecommended. \n12.2.1.2.3 Types of Data Required \nThe Stage I initial assessment should be \nbased on aberrant macrozoobenthic community structure (ascertained from family-level taxo- \nnomic identification); metals concentrations \nabove background levels in the surficial sedi- \nments (ascertained from dating); hazardous per- \nsistent organic compound concentrations above \ndetection levels in carp, benthos, or surficial \nsediments; metals concentrations in carp or \nbenthos, established on a case-by-case basis; and \npresence in fishes of external abnormalities \nknown to have contaminant-related etiologies. \nThe Stage II detailed assessment should be \nbased on a phased sampling of the physical, \nchemical, and biological aspects of the sedi- \nments The biological impacts should be as- \nsessed with both field (benthic invertebrate \ncommunity structure and incidence of fish liver \ntumors) and laboratory (battery of selected \nbioassays) methods. The phased sampling \napproach will allow subsequent testing require- \nments to be reduced. When Phases I and II of \nStage II have revealed homogeneous zones of \nsediment type and similar community structure, \nthe number of Phase III samples can be appro- \npriately scaled down. Impairment due to sedi- \nment contamination and the probable need for \nremediation are established when the biomoni- \ntoring results from the detailed assessment \ndemonstrate significant departures from antrols. \nEach section of UC (1988a) contains a de- \ntailed discussion of the statistical procedures \nrequired, with references and examples. The \npreferred method of interpretation is left to the \nexpert investigator in many cases. \n12.2.1.2.4 Necessary Hardware and Skills \nThe initial assessment, and to an even \ngreater degree the detailed assessment, requires \na large array of field and laboratory equipment. \nAlthough none of the items recommended are \nunusual or inordinately sophisticated, one labo- \nratory or field unit is unlikely to have all the \nrequired apparatus. Specific suggestions for \nhardware and skills are provided by DC (198&a). \nBecause this approach is intended for major \nsediment assessment efforts, several groups \nwould probably have to be mobilized to contrib- \nute to the effort. \n12-6 \n12.2.1.3 Adequacy of Documentation \nEach component method described in UC \n(1988a) is fully referenced in the text and accom- \npanied by a separate bibliography. Some methods \nare more developed than others, and areas where \nadditional validation or calibration is needed are \nclearly identified in the text. \n12.2.2 Applkablllty of Method to Human \nHealth, Aquntk Life, or Wlldllfe \nProtectloll \nThe IJC strategy includes direct measures of \neffects on benthic infauna and fishes and is thus \ndirectly applicabie to aquatic biota. Existing \nsediment assessment methods (e.g., Apparent \nEffects Threshold, Sediment Quality Triad) could \nbe used to evaluate the results of the Stage II \ndetailed assessment and to determine whether \nchemically contaminated sediments have affected \naquatic biota in the vicinity of AOCs. Although \nthe UC (1988a) strategy was not designed to \nassess the effects of toxic chemicals on wildlife or \nhumans, the tissue residue data and the sediment \nchemistry data may be useful in preliminary \nevaluations of contaminant exposure to these \npopulations. Wildlife exposure could occur \nthrough consumption of chemically contaminated \nprey- Human exposure could occur through \nconsumption of chemically contaminated fish or \nthrough dermal absorption by direct contact witb \nchemically contaminated sediments or water. \n12.23 Ability of Metbod to Generate \nNumerical Criteria for Specifk \nChemicals \nThe document was designed to provide guid- \nance to assessment programs. Nevertheless, since \nchemical, toxicological, and infaunal data are \ncollected in the Stage II assessment, it is possible \nthat these data could be used to develop chemical- \nspecific criteria. For example, data from the Stage \nII assessment could be used to develop empirical \nsediment quality values (e.g., AETvalues) that are \nprotective of aquatic biota in locations other than \nthe AOC under consideration. 123 USEFULNESS \n123.1 Environmental Applicability \n12.3.1.1 Suitability for Diflerent Sediment \nrrLpes \nThe approach recommended in UC (1988a) is \nsuitable for any sediment type. Indeed, one of its \nmajor objectives is to characterize and provide a \nthree-dimensional map of the contaminated sadi- \nment mass, including physical, chemical, and \nbiological variables. Tbe investigator is given the \nflexibility to choose the appropriate sampling \nmethods for the sediment type or types in &he \nAOC under study. \n12.3.1.2 Suitability for Different Chemicals \nor Classes of Chemicals \nThe document is intended for situations where \ncontamination is suspected, but where the toxic \nchemicals may or may not be identified. \u2018I&e \nmethods recommended by IJC (1988a) are effcc- \ntive for most contaminants found in Great Lakes \nsediments. \u2018l%e broad-based nature of the ap \nproacb contains sufficient flexibility to deal with \nanomalous situations. \n12.3.1.3 Suitability for Predicting Eficts (RI \nDiierenr Organisms \nThe proposed strategy includes both laboratq \ntesting and analysis of indigenous communities \n(i.e., fsh, macrozoobenthos). In this way, labora- \ntory results (i.e., chemistry, toxicity) that can be \ncompared to standard anditions and literature \nvalues may be placed in the context of empirically \nderived effects data from the site under investiga- \ntion. \n12.3.1.4 Suitability for In-Place Polhtanf \nControl \nThe guidance document was developed specif- \nically for the assessment of in-place pollutant \nproblems. It is designed to fit into the framework \nof evaluating and dmosing remedial optioas by \nproviding an adequate database on which to base \n12-7 \nSediment Chssification Methods Compendium \nsuch decisions. A companion document (UC, \n1988b) provides guidance in the selection of \ncourses of remediation. \n12.3.1.5 Suitability for Source Control \nThe detailed assessment provides an adequate \nframework for identifying hot spots, and for \nestablishing significant differences from back- \nground conditions. In some cases, the resultant \nmaps may provide further evidence of contaminant \nsources and migration patterns, using spatia! \nautocorrelation techniques. Presumably, such \nevidence could facilitate regulation of identified \nsources. However, source control is not a primary \nobjective of the UC (1988a) strategy. \n12.3.1.6 Suitability for Disposuf Applications \nAlthough the document was not intended for \nthe use in decision-making related to the disposal \nof material from navigational dredging, the data \ngenerated from an initial assessment could be used \nto make initial disposal decisions. Other practices \nfor the assessment of dredged material may be \nmore cost-effective, however. \n123.2 General Advantages and Umltations \n12.3.2.1 Ease of Use \nThe proposed strategy is designed to be applica- \nble to the AOC under investigation. It is intended \nto flexible, relying on the judgment and experience \nof those who apply it. A detailed assessment would \nbe practical only in cases where a major remedial \neffort is contemplated. \n12.3.2.2 Relatiw Cost \nY%e Stage I and II assesunents are costly \ncompared to other less comprehensive methods of \naeasing sediment quality. However, when com- \npared to the potential remedial costs, the assessment \na&s are relatively small. The sequential approach \nis designed to reduce sampling, analysis, and ex- \npense where possible. In many cases, the Stage I \nassessment need not be done. If it is clear that a sediment contamination problem exis& then the \ninvestigators may proceed diredly to Stage II \nassessmat. Alternatively, if the Stage I arxxssment \nproduces no results of concern, then Stage Xl need \nnotbeunderhken. Thecostofadetailedassess- \nmea< although relatively high, is controlled some- \nwhat by the sequential approach to data oolle&~~ \nNo firm cost figures are atrrently available, but as- \nsessments planned for priority AOCs under Section \n118(c)(3) of the Water Quality Act of 1987 are \nprojected to cost in the range of $500,000. T&se \n03sts are expeckd to vary from site to site. \n12.3.2.3 Tendency to Be Consd \nlbe strategy is designed to be highly pro&%ive \nof the environment. It combines chemical analysis, \ntoxicity testing, and examination of indigenous \ncommunities to ensure that no significant effects are \noverlooked. Because the application of criteria is \nleft to the expert judgment of the investigator, the \ndegree of conservatism in decisioninaking will be \nvariable. \n12.3.2.4 Level of Accepzance \nIhe guidance doaunent (UC, 198&t) does not \ndesuii a new method, but rather a combination of \nseveral types of methods, each widely accepted in \nits own sphere. The strategy as a whole is being \nusedforthefirsttimein 1989. \n12.3.2.5 Abilify to Be hnpk~nted by \nL4abora!ories with lypidw \nd Handling Fadties \nNone of the methods is particularly unusual or \ndif.ficult, but the detailed assessmentrequhsa \nbreadth of expert& and resourm that an individual \norganization may not possess. \u2018Ibe strategy will \nneedtobeimplementedbydtawingonavarietyof \nexpert& in a given geographical area. \n12.3.2.6 Level of Effkt Required to Gkneme \nRe.SUit.9 \nThe total level of effort for a detailed assess- \nment will be relatively high in most cases. \u2018It& \n12-a \nstrategy is most suitable for major evaluation \nprojects. \n12.3.2.7 \nDegree to which Results Lend Themselves to \n/nterpretarion \nThe actual statistical gnalysis and interpreta- \ntion to generate effects conclusions are relatively \ncomplex and should be done only by trained \ninvestigators. Specific statistical protocols are \nnot recommended. However, the reader is given \nan array of choices, with comments on their \nrespective strengths and weaknesses. The ulti- \nmate decision is left to the investigator. The \ninclusion of chemical, toxicological, and in- \nfauna1 information in the database allows the \ninvestigator to compare different types of indica- \ntors before making decisions. \n12.3.2.8 Degree of Environmental \nApplicability \nOne of lhe strengths of a strategy that in- \ncludes in situ community analysis is that effects \ndata have a high degree of environmental rele- \nvance. Site-relevant species can even be substi- \ntuted in the bioassay battery if necessary, and \nthe body burden and community structure data \nare always site-specific. \n12.3.2.9 Degree of Accuracy and Precision \nThe strategy proposed by the DC (1988a) is \nnot a single method, but rather guidance for a \nstudy design containing many options and \ndecision points. Overall precision or accuracy \nvalues would be impossible to calculate. Never- \ntheless, the criteria for selecting recommended \nprotocols included a consideration of attainable \nprecision. In many sections, the investigator is \ndirected to choose the required level of precision \nfor a given measurement during the study design \nprocess. The \u201caccuracy\u201d of an integrated strat- \negy is difficult to assess, but the methods recom- \nmended by the IJC (1988a) were chosen for \ntheir relevance to the Great Lakes ecosystem, 12.4 STATUS \n12.4.1 Extent of Use \nUC\u2019s (1988a) document was published in \nDecember 1988 and distributed in early 1989. \nThe strategy is intended for the Great Lakes, and \nwas used for the first time in 1989. Most of the \nindividual methods recommended are widely used \nand accepted. \n12.43 Extent to Wbkb the Approach Has \nBeen Field-Validated \nThe first extensive field validation of the ap- \nproach was conducted in 1989-1991 as part of the \nARCS program under section 118(c)(3) of the \nWater Quality Act of 1987. The ARCS Sediment \nassessment reports are expected to be released in \n1993. \n12.43 Reasons for Limited Use \nMost component protocols are in wide use. \nBecause the UC (1988a) document describes a \nmajor effort with an integrated approach, the \nARCS program is the only project where an \nundertaking using this approach has been initiated. \n12.4.4 Outlook for Future Use and \nDevelopment \nWith the backing of both signatories to the \nGreat Lakes Water Quality Agreement, the docu- \nment seems destined for widespread use in the \nGreat Lakes basin. As methods progress, each \nsection of the document will be updated. \n12.5 REFERENCES \nAdams, D.D., D.A. Darby, and R.J.

Redford \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n499 South Capitol Street, SW (WH-556F), Washington, DC 20003 \n(202)260-9179 \nThe Evaluation of Dredged Material Pro- \nposed for Ocean Disposal--Testing Manual \n(USEPA/USACE, 1991) commonly referred to \nas the \u201cGreen Book,\u201d was published in February \n1991 by the U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency (USEPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers (USACE). The Green Book contains \nnational guidance for evaluating the suitability \nof dredged material for ocean disposal; it re- \nplaces the guidance of the original manual \n(USEPA/USACE, 1977) that was published by \nUSEPA and the USACE in 1977. The manual \nstresses the use of bioassay and bioaccumulation \ntesting as evaluative tools, and it contains tech- \nnical guidance on the use of such tests. The \nfollowing is a summary of the 1991 manual and \nthe approach used by USEPA and the USACE \nto determine the suitability of dredged material \nfor ocean disposal. The manual will be revised \nat a future date, based on the findings of an \nEPA Science Advisory Board (SAB) review \n(SAB,1992), and changes will be made to the \nOcean Dumping Regulations (referenced below). \n13.1 APPLICATION \nThe 1991 USEPA/USACE Green Book \nprovides updated guidance for dredging appli- \ncants, scientists, and regulators to evaluate \ndredge-material compliance with the 1977 U.S. \nOcean Dumping Regulations [Title 40, Code of \nFederal Regulations (CFR), Parts 220-228]. The \nmanual is applicable to all activities involving \nthe transportation of dredged material for the \npurpose of dumping it in ocean waters outside \nthe baseline from which the territorial sea is \nmeasured. The guidance in this manual is appli- cable to dredging operations conducted under \npermits as well as to federal projects conducted \nby the USACE. The procedures in this manual \ndo not apply to activities excluded by \n40 CFR 220.1. \nIt is important to note that the regulations \nare legally binding and that the guidance provid- \ned in this manual is responsive to the specific \nrequirements of these regulations, but the manu- \nal does not carry the force of law. The docu- \nment simply provides guidance on evaluating the \npotential environmental impact of dredged-mate- \nrial ocean disposal. \nThe manual is organized into tiers for effi- \ncient evaluation of the suitability of dredged \nmaterial for ocean disposal. Within the tiers, \nspecific physical, chemical, and biological tests \nare recommended. To meet specific regional \nneeds, USEPA Region and USACE District \noffices are to develop local agreements and \nmanuals to implement the national guidance in \nthe 1991 Green Book (such as using local spe- \ncies in biological tests and screening for particu- \nlar contaminants in chemical analyses). \n13.1.1 current use \nThe 1991 Green Book replaces the 1977 \nGreen Book. USEPA Region and USACE Dis- \ntrict offices are developing local agreements and \nregional testing manuals that implement the \n1991 Green Book guidance and establish permit \nprocedures for dredging and dredged-material \ndisposal. \nProjects that have been issued under \nUSACE permits prior to the completion of the \nnew local agreement/manual for the area cov- \nered by the project may continue to be evaluated \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \naccording to the 1977 guidance manual and the \nexisting local guidance. New dredged-material \ndisposal projects, projects that have not had \nsampling and analysis plans approved prior to \nfinalization of the local agreement/manual, \nshould be evaluated under the updated guidance \nin the 1991 Green Book. Ongoing projects that \nhave been approved based on 1977 Green Book \nguidance should be reevaluated according to \n1991 Green Book guidance and the new local \nagreement/manual within 3 years of permit \napproval. \n13.1.2 Potential Use \nThe Green Book guidance, and revisions \nthereof, will be applied to dredged-material \nevaluations for the foreseeable future. \nThe manual will be revised at a future date \nbased on (1) the findings of an EPA SAB re- \nview (SAB, 1992), (2) technical advances in \nassessing sediment contamination and marine \nenvironmental impact, and (3) changes to the \nOcean Dumping Regulations. \n13.2 DESCRIPTION \nAnalysis of sediment to determine its suit- \nability for ocean disposal is conducted accord- \ning to the procedures in the 1991 Green Book. \nThe 1991 Green Book recommends procedures \nthat satisfy section 103 of the Marine Protec- \ntion, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 \n(MPRSA), Public Law 92-532. The MPRSA \nwas enacted to regulate ocean dumping of all \nmaterials that might adversely affect human \nhealth, the marine environment, or other legiti- \nmate uses of the oceans. In addition, the \nMPRSA implements the Convention on the \nPrevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of \nWastes and Other Matter (London Dumping \nConvention), of which the United States is a \nsignatory. MPRSA section 103 specifies that \nall proposed operations involving the trans- \nportation and dumping of dredged material \ninto ocean waters must be evaluated to de- \ntermine the potential environmental impact of such activities. These environmental evalua- \ntions must be in agreement with the criteria \npublished in 40 CPR Parts 220-228 and \n33 CFR Parts 320-330 and 335-338. \nTechnical guidance on specific methods \nfor testing dredged material is presented in the \n1991 Green Book. If the results of the appro- \npriate tests show that the proposed dredged \nmaterial meets the chemical- and biological- \neffects criteria, and meets other requirements \nin the regulations, disposal of the material at a \ndesignated ocean dredged-material disposal site \n(ODMDS) is supported. If the test results \nshow that the material does not meet the cri- \nteria set forth in the regulations, significant \nimpact on the ocean environment is predicted. \nSignificant adverse impact may include ad- \nverse consequences to the marine ecosystem \nand negative human-health effects from uses \nof the marine environment. \nThe manual does not present guidance for \nthe disposal of dredged material that fails to \nmeet the regulatory criteria. Such disposal \ninvolves management decisions and case-spe- \ncific engineering work (e.g., control of dump \nreleases, disposal-site capping, submarine \nburial, and predisposal treatment) that are \nbeyond the scope of the document. \n13.2.1 Description of Method \nIntegral to the 1991 Green Book is a \ntiered-testing procedure to characterize \ndredged material and predict its impact on the \nwater-column and benthic environment at \nODMDSs. The procedure was developed by \nUSEPA and USACE personnel and testing- \nlaboratory researchers, and is consistent with \nthe requirements of the Ocean Dumping Regu- \nlations, state-of-the-art dredged-material \nevaluation techniques, and the realities of the \ntesting and permitting process for new and \nexisting projects. Knowledge of local condi- \ntions is both recommended and necessary to \nadapt the national guidance in the manual to \nspecific dredged-material projects. USEPA \nRegions and USACE Districts are presently \ndeveloping local agreements/manuals to apply \n13-2 \n13-\u201cGreen Book\u201d Sediment-Testing Approach \nthe national guidance of the manual to specific \ndredging and disposal areas. \nThe tiered-testing procedure in the Green \nBook comprises four tiers, with decision points \nat each tier (Figure 13-1). Each successive tier \nprovides increasing investigative intensity to \ngenerate the information for permitting deci- \nsions on ocean disposal. \nThe tiered-testing procedure is constructed \nto determine whether the dredged material \nmeets the limiting permissible concentration \n(LPC), as defined in section 227.27 of the \nOcean Dumping Regulations. The LPC for the \nliquid-phase concentration of dredged material \nin the water column is the concentration that, \nafter allowance for initial mixing, does not ex- \nceed applicable marine water-quality criteria \n(WQC) or a toxicity lhreshald of 0.01 of the \nacutely toxic concentration. The LPC of the \nsuspended particulate and solid phases is the \nconcentration that will not cause unreasonable \ntoxicity or bioaccumulation. \nThe overall tiered-testing procedure is rela- \ntively flexible. The dredged-material evaluator \ncan enter and exit the testing procedures at any \ntier. However, to begin the evaluation in Tier \nII, III, or IV, the existing data must satisfy the \nrequirements of the earlier tier(s). Additional- \nly, Tier II testing for water-quality criteria \n(WQC) compliance is mandatory if the water- \ncolumn evaluation cannot be completed within \nTier I. To exit any tier before reaching a \ndecision on LPC compliance, the dredged- \nmaterial evaluator must select an option other \nthan open-ocean disposal. \nIn most cases, determinations of LPC com- \npliance can be made in Tier I, II, or III. In \nextraordinary cases, where LPC compliance \ncannot be determined by Tier III, the dredged \nmaterial must be evaluated under Tier IV. \nTier IV tests are case-specific investigations of \npotential impact of the dredged material at the \nODMDS. Significant investment in the re- \nsearch and development of analytical methods \nis usually necessary to conduct Tier IV evalu- \nations, and the applicant might select an alter- \nnative to open-ocean disposal instead of \nproceeding with Tier IV testing. Similarly, an applicant can try to save time and money by \nproceeding directly to Tier II, III, or IV if it is \nbelieved that analysis in the earlier tiers will \nnot lead to a definitive evaluation. The only \nabsolute requirement is that the dredged mate- \nrial must comply with the regulations if it is to \nbe dumped at an ODMDS. The tiered-testing \nprocedure facilitates this determination. \nIn summary, the 1991 Green Book \nIncludes state-of-the-art methods to \ndetermine the potential impact of ma- \nrine-sediment disposal; \nEnsures adherence to the Ocean Dump- \ning Regulations (40 CFR Parts 220- \n228); \nIncorporates existing (and valuable) \nregional expertise and guidance into \nthe evaluation process; and \nProvides for National consistency in \nevaluating dredged material for ocean \ndisposal. \n13.2.1.Z Objectives and Assumptions \nThe objective of the tiered-testing proce- \ndure is to determine whether the water-column \nand benthic LPC is met for the proposed \ndredged material, as defiied in the Ocean \nDumping Regulations. Three decision options \nare possible as the dredged-material evaluator \nproceeds through the tiers. \n(1) The LPC is met; the ocean disposal \noption is supported; further evaluation \nis unnecessary. \n(2) The LPC evaluation is inconclusive; \nthe ocean disposal option is not sup- \nported; proceed to the next tier. \n(3) The LPC is not met; the ocean disposal \noption is not supported; further evalua- \ntion is unnecessary. \n133 \nSdimd Class@dion Methods Compendium \nKfYTOWYEWCUfLRC \nI' - \n- -- TIER I \nTKRS LE.LP \nigun 1Sl. 1991 Green Book tlered-testlng procedure. 13--\u201cGreen Book\u201d Sediment-Testing Appvach \nBoth the water-column and bentbic LPC \nconsiderations must be satisfactorily resolved for \nthe open-ocean disposal option to be supported. \nAn inconclusive evaluation in Tiers I-III requires \nthe dredging applicant to conduct additional \ntesting in subsequent tiers, or to decide not to \noceandump. However, a determination of LPC \nnoncompliance does not necessarily exclude all \npossibilities for ocean disposal. Management \nactions might be feasible to make the dredged \nmaterial meet the LPC. Management actions for \ndredged material that exceeds water-column or \nbentbic LPC are rrot included in the Green Book \nbecause of the wide range of available options \nand the project-specific nature of such work. \nIt is assumed that the users of the 1991 \nGreen Book are generally familiar with the need \nfor and methods of dredged-material testing. \nThe manual is not a standalone document. The \nguidance in the manual requires the evaluator to \nconsult the regulations frequently (40 CFR Parts \n220-228 is included in the Green Book as Ap- \npendix A) and to have a general understanding \nof material contained in the numerous citations \nand references. The guidance in the manual \nconcentrates on data collection and decision \npoints, and it only summarizes recommended \nfield and laboratory procedures that can be used \nto obtain data. The user must refer to the origi- \nnal sources for most of the physical, chemical, \nand biological testing procedures. \n13.2.1.2 Level ofEflorr \nTier I: Initial Assessments-Tier I is used to \nidentify contaminants of concern and determine \ndredged-material LPC compliance through anal- \nysis of existing physical, chemical, and biologi- \ncal information. For many dredging projects, \nthere is a wealth of readily available information \non the proposed dredged material and on the \ncharacteristics of the disposal site. This is espe- \ncially true of areas that have historically under- \ngone maintenance dredging or have been the \nsubject of other studies, such as fishery assess- \nments. The available information for a given \narea might not be sufficient to reach a final LPC \nevaluation, but often there are accessible high- quality data that can supplement the results of \ntests in subsequent tiers and facilitate reaching \nan early decision with lowered expenditure of \ntime and resources. \nWhatever the source of information for \nTier I evaluations, the quality of the data must \nbe evaluated and weighed accordingly. The \nreferences in Chapter 13 of the manual, Quality- \nAssurance Considerations, should be consulted \nfor guidance for evaluating the quality of data \nob&ned from different information sources. \nIf the information set compiled in Tier I is \ncomplete and comparable to information that \nwould appropriately satisfy the LPC in Tier II, \nIII, or IV, a decision on regulatory compliance \nbe completed without proceeding into the next \ntiers. For compliance determination to be com- \npleted within Tier I, the weight of evidence of \nthe collected information must convincingly \nshow that the dredged-material disposal either \nwill or will not meet tbe LPC. \nIncluded in Tier I is an assessment of the \nthree exclusionary criteria in 40 CFR 227.13(b): \n(1) the dredged material is predominantly sand, \ngravel, or rock from a highenergy area; (2) the \nmaterial is suitable for beach nourishment; or \n(3) the material is similar to the disposal site \nand from an area far removed from pollution \nsources. If one or more of the above exclusion- \nary criteria can be satisfied, the LPC is met for \nthe dredged material and no further evaluation is \nrequired. If none of the exclusionary criteria is \nmet and the collected information is insufficient \nto reach a definitive LPC determination, the \nevaluation process moves to Tier II. \nTier II: PbysScaUCbemical EvaluationcTier \nII consists of physical and chemical data evalua- \n.tion. To determine marine WQC compliance, a \nnumerical mixing model is used; to evaluate \nbenthic-impact potential for nonpolar organic \ncompounds, a theoretical bioaccumuIation poten- \ntial (TBP) calculation is used. The conceptual \npurpose of the tier is to provide reliable, rapid \nscreening of impact potential without the need \nfor further testing. This purpose is fulfilled for \nwater-column evaluations, but at present there is \nno USEPA-approved single screening procedure \nSediment ClassiJication Methods Compendium \nfor deposited sediment. When technically sound \nsediment-quality criteria (SQC) are developed \nand approved for dredged-material evaluation, \nthey will be incorporated at this level. \nTier II: Water-Column PbysicaVCbemicaI \nEvaluation=The Tier II water-column eval- \nuation for WQC compliance is a two-step pro- \ncess that includes the application of a numerical \nmixing model. in Step 1, the model is used as a \nscreen; all of the contaminants in the dredged \nmaterial are assumed to be released into the \nwater column during the disposal process. If the \nmodel predicts that the concentration of contam- \ninants of concern released into the water column \nis less than the applicable WQC and if no syner- \ngistic effects among the contaminants are \nsuspected, the dredged material meets the water- \ncolumn LPC and no further water-column evalu- \nations are necessary. \nIf LPC compliance cannot be shown in \nStep 1, Step 2 is conducted. In Step 2, chemical \ndata from an elutriate test of the dredged materi- \nal are run in the model. Compared to the as- \nsumption of total contaminant release in the Step \n1 screen, the elutriate data applied in Step 2 are \na more precise representation of the concentra- \ntion of contaminants that would actually be \nreleased into the water column during ocean dis- \nposal of dredged material. \nIf the model predicts in Step 2 that any \nWQC are exceeded, the water-column LPC is \nnot met (open-ocean disposal not supported). If \nthere are WQC for all of the contaminants of \nconcern, if no WQC are exceeded by the Step 2 \nmodel, and if no contaminant synergistic effects \nare suspected, the water-column LPC is met and \nno further water-column evaluations are neces- \nsary (open-ocean disposal supported). If there \nare contaminants of concern without WQC or if \nsynergistic effects are suspected, water-column \ntoxicity and water-column LPC compliance must \nbe evaluated in Tier III. \nNumerid Models for Initial Mixtng-Numer- \nical models are used to evaluate dredged-mate- \nrial dilution during the initial-mixing phase of \nocean disposal, as defined in the regulations. The 1991 Green Book recommends using the \nUSACE Automated Dredging and Disposal \nAlternatives Management System (ADDAMS) \nmodels to evaluate initial mixing of dredged \nmaterial at ODMDSs. ADDAMS models can be \nrun on a personal computer with a minimum of \nhardware. The models account for the physical \nprocesses of dredged-material disposal at open- \nwater disposal sites by calculating the water- \ncolumn concentrations of dissolved contaminants \nand suspended sediments and the initial deposi- \ntion of material \u2018on the bottom. Three separate \nADDAMS models address different methods of \ndisposal: \nn DIFID Disposal from an instanta- \nneous dump \nn DIFCD Disposal from a continuous \ndischarge \nn DIFHD Disposal from a hopper \ndredge \nTo evaluate initial mixing following ocean \ndisposal, the appropriate model is run for &e \ncontaminant requiring the greatest amount of \ndilution to meet the LPC. The models simulate \nmovement of the disposed material as it falls \nthrough the water column, as it is transported \nand diffused by the ambient current, and as it \nspreads over the bottom. The models have \nsome limitations; for example, the DIFID model \nwill not work for very shallow disposal sites \nwhere the discharge time from the barge exceeds \nthe descent period to the bottom. However, the \nmodels can simulate a wide range of disposal \noptions. USEPA and the USACE are in the \nprocess of field-verifying these models. \nAppendix B of the 1991 Green Book is a \nsummary of the ADDAMS models; the armput- \ner diskettes that accompany the manual anttaln \nthe models themselves. ADDAMS modeling \npersonnel at the USACE Waterways Experiment \nStation (WES), Vicksburg, Mississippi, are \navailable to supply model updates, answer ques- \ntions, and assist with the selection and running \nof the individual models. \n13-\u201cGreen Book\u201d Se&nent-Testing Approach \nTable 13-l. 1991 Green Book Species for Water-Column and Benthic Evaluations. - \nWater-Column Species Benthlc Species \nw Crustaceans \nMysids \nMysidopsis sp.\u2019 \nNeomysis sp.\u2019 \nffolmesimysis sp.\u2019 \nShrimp \nPalaemonetes sp. \nPenaeus sp. \nPanda/us sp. \nCrab \nCaliinectes sapidus \nCancer sp. \nn Fish \nMenidia sp .\u2019 \nCyma togaster aggregata\u2019 \nCyprinodon variegatus \nbgodon rhomboides \nLeiostomus xanthurus \nCitharicthys stigmaeus \nLeuresthes tenuis \nCoryphaena hippurus \nn Zooplankton \nCopepods \nAcartia sp.\u2019 \nMussel larvae \nMytilus eduli9 \nOyster larvae \nCfassostrea virginit \nOsfrea sp.\u2019 \nSea-urchin larvae \nStrongyiocentrotus \npurpufa tus \nLytechinus pictus n Crustaceans \nlnfaunal Amphipods \nRhepoxynius sp. \nAmpeliscf3 sp. \nEohaustorius sp: \nGrandiderella japonica \nCorophium insidiosum \nMysids \nh4ysidopsis sp. \nNeomysis sp . \nHolmesimysis sp . \nShrimp \nPenaeus sp. \nPaiaemonetes sp. \nCrangon sp. \nPanda/us sp. \n+yonia ingentis \nCrab \nCalinectes sapidus \nCancer sp. \n8 Fwh \nClevela*ia ios \nAtherinops affinis \n= Burrowing Polychaetes \nNeanthes sp: \nNereis sp.\u2019 \nNephthys sp. \nG&era sp. \nAr8nicok sp. \nAbafenico/a sp. \nn Moulws \nYokiia limatula \nMacoma sp. \nNucula sp. \nProfothaca staminea \nTepes japonica \nUercenariti mercenaria \n%commended test species. \n13-7 \nSediment Chssificu tion Methods Compendium \nThe model outpul can present water-column \ncontaminant concentrations in milligrams per \nliter. These concentrations are compared to the \nappropriate LPCs to determine compliance. \nTier II: Benthic PhysicaUChemical Evalua- \ntions-As previously noted, only benthic effects \nattributi to nonpolar organic chemicals in the \ndeposited sediment can be addressed in Tier II at \nthe present time. Nonpolar organic chemicals in- \nclude all organic compounds that do not dissociate \nor form ions. T&se include chlorinated hydrocar- \nbon pesticides, other halogenated hydrocarbons, \npolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), most polynu- \nclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxins, and \nfurans. It does not incIude polar organic com- \npounds, organometals, and metals. If all of the \ncontaminants of ancem in the dredged material \nare nonpolar organic compounds, the lheoretical \nbioaccumulation potential (TBP) can be calculated \nfor the dredged material and the reference sedi- \nment* to determine benlhic LPC compliance ne \nTBP calculalion is an environmentally conserva- \ntive screen, based on calculating the concentration \nof the nonpolar organic chemical in the sedimenl, \nthe total organic&on concentration, and the \npercent lipid content of an organism of interest. If \nthe TBP of the dredged material is not staGstically \ngreater than that of the reference material, the \nLPC for the nonpolar organic contaminants is met. \n(Aa&-toxicity evalualions must be performed \nunder Tier Ill unless sufficient toxicity information \nwas obtained under Tier I.) \nIf any of the contaminants of concern are \npolar organic compounds or have suspeded toxic \ncomponents or if the dredged-material TBP ex- \nceeds the reference-material TBP described above, \nthe bioacarmulation evaluation for benthic impact \nby the dredged material must take place in Tier III \nor IV. \u2018The benefit of additional tests in Tier II to \nscreen for benthic impact is recognized by USEPA \nIA reference sediment is detined as a sediment, wbstantial- \nly free of ax\u2019itaminank, that is as similar as practicable to \nthe grain size of the dredged material and the sediment at \nthe disposal site, and that reflects the conditions that would \nexist in tbe vicinity of the disposal site had no dredged- \nmaterial disposal ever taken place, but bad all other influ-. \nenceS on sediment condition taken place. and the USACE, and new tests are under develop \nment and evaluation. When the scientific and \nregulatory community verifies one or more of \nthese tests, they will be incorporated intoTier II in \na future Green Book revision. Meanwhile, evalu- \nation of benthic impad that cannot be ma& in \nTier I must be completed in Tier III or IV. \n\u2018Ikr III: Biological Evduatioas-73er III tests \ninclude (1) determination of w&r-column toxicity \nand (2) assessment of contaminant toxicity and \nbioaccumulation from the material to be dredged. \nThe evaluations in this tier are based on the output \nfrom Tiers I and II and comprise standardized \nbioassays wilh the organisms listed in Table 13-1. \nTier III: Water-Column Biological Evalua- \ntions-Tier III water-column tests are acute tests \nthat evaluate the toxicity of the dissolved and \nsuspended portions of the dredged material that \nremains in the water column after initial mixing. \nThe bioassays are run if the Tier II evaluations \nare inconclusive, e.g., if there are not applicable \nWQC for all contaminants of concern or there .is \nreason to suspect synergistic effects among the \ncontaminants. (See Tier II.) The tests involve \nexposing fish, crustaceans, and zooplankton to a \ndilution series containing both dissolved- and \nsuspended-sediment components of tie dredged \nmaterial. A typical test monitors organism mor- \ntality over a 96-h period. \nThe results of the bioassays are used to calcu- \nlate the &, concentration of the dredged mated \nin the water c&unn. The LPC for this evaluation \nis 1 percent of the L&, outside the ODMDS \nduring the initial 4-h mixing period and anywhere \nin the marine environment 4 b after disposal. \nFollowing Ihe determination of the LPC for the \nproposed dredged material, the data are used to \nND ihe numerical model (see model discussion \nabove) and determine LPC compliance. \n\u2018Ikr III: Benthic Biological Evaluations-Ben- \nthic evaluations in Tier III consist of toxicity and \nbioaccumulation tests. To amdud these tests, the \n1991 Green Book provides laboratory guidance \non sediment preparation; treatment, reference-, \nand control-sediment tests; ,replicates; organism \n13-8 \nIt \u201cGreen Book \u201d Sediment-Testing Approach \nhandling; test-chamber conditions; QA considera- \ntions; and data analysis. The organisms used in \nthe tests are surrogates for disposal-site species \nand are used to estimate dredged-material effects. \nThe toxicity tests quantify mortality. If the mor- \ntality of the test species in the dredged-material \nbioassays is greater than the allowable percentage \nover the mortality in the reference-sediment bio- \nassays, the LPC is not met. If, however, the \ndredged-material tests below the allowable per- \nantage, or the increased mortality is statistically \ninsignificanf the LPC is met. \nThe bioaccumulation tests evaluate the poten- \ntial of benthic organisms to accumulate contami- \nnants from the dredged material in their tissues. \nAt the conclusion of the tests, the tissues of the \norganisms are analyzed for the contaminants of \nconcern that are identified in Tier I. \nSection 227.27 of the Ocean Dumping Reg- \nulations requires that bentbic bioassays be con- \nducted on dredged material with filter-feeding, \ndeposit-feeding, and burrowing species. Infaunal \namphipods, such as Ampelisca sp. and Rhepoxy- \nn&r sp., are sensitive bioindicators and strongly \nrecommended in the Green Book as the preferred \nspecies for toxicity tests. Infaunal amphipods \nfilter-feed, deposit-feed, and, to some extent, bur- \nrow in the sediment, thereby fulfilling the three \norganism otegories in the regulations. For bioac- \ncumulation evaluations, the manual recommends \nusing a burrowing polychaete (e.g., Neanrhes sp. \nor Nereis sp.) and a deposit-feeding bivalve mol- \niusc (e.g., Macoma sp. or Yoldia limaMu). In \nsummary, the manual recommends that at least \ntwo species be tested for acute toxicity and at \nleast two other species for bioaccumulation evalu- \nation. Each set of test species should cover the \nthree species types stipulated in the regulations. \nThe ecological and economic relevance of the \norganisms and the practical aspects of using the \nspecies in the laboratory, such as tolerance to \ngrairi-size ranges and seasonal availability, also \nmust be considered when selecting the test \nspecies. \nTIte Tier III bioaccumulation evaluation com- \npares the contaminant level in the tissues of the \norganisms to two criteria: (1) the United States \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) Action Levels for Poisonous or Deleterious Substances in \nFish and Shellfish for Human Consumption and \n(2) the contaminant levels in organisms that are \nexposed to the reference sediment. Regardless of \nthe statistical comparison to the reference-material \ntest organisms, if the level in the tissues of \ndredged-material organisms statistically exceeds \n$e FDA levels in any\u2019 category, the LPC is not \nmet. If the dredged-material results are lower \nthan the FDA action levels and not statistically \ngreater than the reference material level, the LPC \nfor bioaccumulation is satisfied. However, if bio- \naccumulation exceeds that found in the reference- \nmaterial tests, the test results must be evaluated \nagainst case-specific criteria. USEPA and the \nUSACE develop the evaluative criteria case by \ncase from local technical information that ad- \ndresses the bioaccumulation aspects of the benthic \ncriteria of section 227.13(c)(3) of the regulations. \nAt present, tests for chronic sublethal expo- \nsure to benthic contaminants are being developed. \nWhen the tests are approved by USEPA, they \nwill be incorporated in Tier III in future updates \nto the Green Book. \nTier IV: Advanced Biological Evalurtions- \nTier IV consists of bioassay and bioaccumulation \ntests to evaluate the long-term benthic arid water- \ncolumn impact of dredged material. Tests at this \nlevel are selected to address specific issues for a \nspecific dredging operation that could not be fully \nevaluated in the earlier tiers. Since these tests are \ncase-specific and since they require significant \ntime and money to complete, evaluative criteria \nmust be agreed on in advance by USEPA and by \nthe USACE to determine compliance with the \nUK. \nConducting Tier IV benthic testing is possible \nwith current methods, but the 1991 Green Book \nemphasizes that this tier is not intended for rou- \ntine application. Tier IV benthic tests consume \nsignificant resources of the dredging applicant \nand of the regulatory authority, and a fiial non- \ncompliance determination is still possible. l\u2019here- \nfore, the applicant must weigh the options and \ndecide whether to perform Tier IV testing or to \nconsider an alternative that does not involve \nocean dumping, such as upland disposal. If the \n13-9 \nSediment Classifiultion Methods Compendium \napplicant elects to proceed with Tier IV testing, \nthe role of the regulatory authority is to design \ntests that lead to a defmitive.LPC evaluation for \nthe project. \nUnder Tier IV evaluations, bioaccumulation \ntesting measures the steady-state body burden of \ncontaminants of concern in tissues of organisms \nsubjected to long-term laboratory exposures or in \ntissues of appropriately sampled field organisms. \nTbe contaminant concentration in tbe tissues of \ndredged-material test organisms is compared \nagainst the appropriate FDA action levels and \nagainst bioaccumulation data obtained from or- \nganisms that are exposed to reference-material \nsediment. If contaminant bioaccumulation in the \ndredged-material organisms is less than the FDA \nlevels but greater than the levels in the reference- \nmaterial organisms, organisms are collected from \nthe vicinity of the disposal site and analyzed for \nthe contaminants of concern. If the contaminant \nbioaccumulation of the dredged-material organ- \nisms is lower than the steady-state body burden \nof the fieldcollected organisms, the LPC for bio- \naccumulation is met. If field-collected organisms \nhave contaminant levels lower than those of the \ndredged-material organisms, case-specific criteria \nare developed to make a final LPC compliance \ndetermination for bioaccumulation. \n13.2.1.2.1 Type of Sampling Required \nSection 8.0 of the 1991 Green Book, Collec- \ntion and Preservation of Samples, provides gener- \nal information on sampling plans and sample \nhandling, preservation, and storage. \nTo adequately and efficiently conduct a \ndredged-material evaluation, a comprehensive \nsampling plan should be in place before sampling \nbegins. Sufficient amounts of sediment and water \nshould be collected to conduct the necessary eval- \nuations. Carehrl consideration of maximum \nallowable and recommended holding times for \nsediments, as well as the exigencies of resamp \nling, should.be given careful consideration. Ad- \nditionally, sample size should be small enough to \nbe ccrnveniently handled and transported, but \nlarge enough to meet the requirements for all \nplanned analyses. Tbe overall confidence of the final LPC determination is based on the following \nthree factors. \nn Collecting representative samples; \nm Using appropriate sampling tedmiques; \nand \nn Protecting or preserving the samples until \nthey are tested. \nTable 13-2 shows tbe general sampling re- \nquirements to conduct dredged-material testing. \nActual sampling requirements are projectspecific \nand are determined during the development of the \nproject plan, based on the guidance that is provid- \ned in the 1991 Green Book and in local agree- \nments/manuals. \n13.2.1.2.2 Methods \nAs described in Section 13.2.1.2.1 above, \nonly existing information is evaluated in Tier I, \nThis requires the careful compilation and analysis \nof such information. If the information czumot \nshow that the proposed dredged material meets \none of the exclusionary criteria, or if the \ninformation is insufficient to reach an LPC deter- \nmination, physical, chemical, and biological infor- \nmation on the dredged material and the ODMDS \nmust be collected in Tiers II and/or III. \nProper sample collection, handling, and pres- \nervation are critical to the accurate evaluation of \nTier II and III test results. Sampling methods are \nusually developed by individual testing laborab \nries and documented in standard operating proce- \ndure (SOP) documents. Consistent use of SOPS \nin the field and laboratory ensure that sampling \nand analytical errors are minimized. \nMethods necessary to conduct toxicity and \nbioaccumulation evaluations may include the \nfollowing: \nn Sieving; \nI Combustion; \nn Gravimetry; \n13-10 \nXi-\u201cGreen Book\u201d Scdimpnf-Testing Approach \nTable lS2.

Many federal, state, and contract labora- \ntories have capabilities to conduct most or all of \nthe necessary evaluations. However, to conserve \ntime and resources, field sampling, laboratory \nwork, data management, and analysis of the re- \nsults are often conducted by separate organizations \naccording to aptitude, cost, and scheduling \nparameters. \nThe general categories of capabilities neces- \nsary to reach a Tier III dredged-material IJC \ncompliance determination are the following: \n= Regulation and literature research; \nn Field sampling at the dredging site, dis- \nposal site, and reference site; \nW Physical analysis of sediment samples; \nn Trace-metal (chemical) analysis of water \nand sediment samples; Organic-compound (chemical) analysis of \nwater and sediment samples; \nNumerical modeling for initial-mixing \nWlySk, \nToxicity bioassay testing of elutriate sam- \nples; \nToxicity bioassay testing of whole-sedi- \nment samples; \nBioaccumulation testing; \nChemical analysis of tissue samples; \nStatistical analysis of test results; \nQuality-assurance implementation \n(throughout evaluation); and \nCompliance determination. \n13.2.1.3 Dtxxune~tion \nThroughout the 1991 Green Book references \nare provided for the recomm ended sampling and \ntesting methods, data analyses, QA procedures, \nand additional testing guidance. For convenience \nto manual usefs, a copy of the U.S. Qcean Dump \ning Regulations (40 CFR Parts 220-228) is includ- \nedinthe1991GreenBookasAppettdixA \nInformation on documentation and record- \nkeeping is interspersed throughout the testing \nguidance. Records ensure that all aspects of the \nfield and laboratory work are documented so that \nthe resulting data may be properly interpreted \nDredged-material test data may be rejected if their \nhistory cannot be confidently traced. \n\u2018lk2.2 Applicability of Metbod to Homae \nHealth, Marine Life, or Wildlife \nPI-Ot4XtiOB \nThe effects-based guidance provided in the \n1991 Green Book is directly applicable to the \nprotection of human health, marine life, and \n13-12 \n13-\"Green Book\u201d Sediment-Testing Approach \nwildlife because it is based on determining LPC \ncompliance. if the testing shows that either the \nUC for the water-column or benthic environ- \nment will be exceeded, ocean disposal for the \nproposed dredged material is not supported. In \n40 CFR 227.27(a), the LPC is defined as the \nconcentration of the liquid phase of the dredged \nmaterial that will not exceed either the estab- \nlished WQC or 1 percent of the acutely toxic \nconcentration following the initial-mixing phase \n(initial mixing is defined in 40 CFR 229.29). In \n40 CFR 227.27(b), the LPCS for the suspended \nparticulate and solid phases are defined as those \nconcentrations \u201c. . . that will not cause unrea- \nsonable acute or chronic toxicity or other suble- \nthal adverse effects based on bioassay results \nusing appropriately sensitive marine organisms \n. . . or will not cause accumulation of taric \nmaterials in the human food chain.\u201d \nThe tiered-testing procedure in the manual \nestablishes a conservative, yet workable, deci- \nsion-making process for environmentally protect- \nive dredged-material management. Dredged \nmaterial that poses no risk of adverse impact is \nreadily supported for ocean disposal early in the \nprocedure (i.e., Tier I or 11). Dredged material \nthat has unknown impact potential is evaluated \nto the level required to make a definitive LPC \ncompliance determination. Only dredged mate- \nrial that is shown to meet both the water-column \nand benthic LPC through state-of-the-art analyti- \ncal techniques is supported for open-ocean \ndisposal. \n13.23 Ability of the Testing to Generate \nNumerical Criteria for Specific \nChemicals \nThe physical, chemical, and biological data \ngenerated by the Tier II, III, and IV tests can be \nused lo field-validate SQC that are presently \nunder development. The state-of-the-art samp- \nling and analytical techniques contained in the \n1991 Green Book guidance wiI1 provide for in- \ncreases in method reproducibility, confidence of \nthe test data, and utility to SQC research and \ndevelopment projects. 133 USErmLNESS \n133.1 Environmentd AppUabiHty \nThe guidance in the 1991 Green Book is \nsuitable for dredged material regulated under \nMPRSA because it is based on biological-effeds \ntesting, which takes into account synergistic, \nanbgonistic, and additive effects of all contami- \nnants in the material. This approach includes \nbo+ water-column and benthic impad, and \nassesses both toxicity and bioaccumulation. \nAdaptations of the guidance are also being ap- \nplied to nearshore and Great Lakes dredge dis- \nposal projects, and the tiered testing framework \nmay serve as a model for sediment assessmats \nunder other regulatory and nonregulatory \nprograms. \n13.3.1.1 Suitability for Different Sediment \nOyPS \nExcept for extremely coarse- or angular- \ngrain sediments, the tiered-testing approach is \nsuitable for all sediment types. The test organ- \nisms recommended in the manual are suitable \nfor most medium- and fine-grain dredged mate- \nrial. If the dredged material being tested is \ncomposed of very coarse sediments, or the \ndredged material has other physical properties \nthat are potentially incompatible with &om- \nmended test species, alternative organisms may \nbe used if they meet 40 CFR 227.27(c) and are \necologically relevant to the disposal site. Al- \nternative test organisms may also be necessary \nto avoid grain-shape insensitivities when using \nsediment-ingesting organisms. Noncontami- \nnant-related mortality has been linked on at \nleast one occasion to internal organism damage \nthat was caused by highly angular sediment of \nmoderate grain size (Oakland Harbor sediment; \nWord et al., 1990). Sample handling and \nchemical extraction of very coarse-sediment \ndredged material can also cause analytical \nproblems. \nID general, few analytical problems are \ncaused by sediment type. Grain-size problems \noccur rarely because (1) most large-grain-size \n23-13 \nSediment Class+cation Methods Compendium \nsediment contains few contaminants and meets \nthe LPC in either Tier I or II, and (2) the \ntiered-testing procedure is relatively flexible \nand allows for alternative evaluation methods. \n13.3.1.2 S&ability for Different Chemicok or \nClasses of Chemical Can&n&ants \nSince the guidance in the 1991 Green Book \nuses effects-based tests, it does not rely on the \nexplicit identification of contaminants for deci- \nsion-making. However, the guidance is suitable \nfor detecting and quantifying a wide range of \norganic and inorganic chemicals. In Tier I of the \ntesting procedure, target analytes are determined \nfor the proposed dredged material. If antami- \nnation is suspected, but specific contaminants \ncannot be isolated in the Tier I evaluation, the \nmanual recommends that the dredged material be \nscanned for a broad spectrum of contaminants. A \nlist of 131 potential target analytes is provided in \nTable 9-l of the 1991 Green Book, Priority Pol- \nlutant and 301(l) Pesticides Usted According to \nStructural Compound Class. \nExtensive guidance for laboratory analysis of \norganic and inorganic compounds is provided in \nSection 9 of the manual, Physical Analysis of \nSediment and Chemical Analysis of Sediment, \nWater, and Tissue Samples. Target analytes for \nthe water and tissue analyses are the same as \nthose for whole-sediment analyses. Guidance is \nalso provided in Section 9 of the manual for \nminimizing salt interferences with the chemical \nanalyses. \n13.3.1.3 Suitability for Predicting Eflects on \nDifferent Organisms \nAll four tiers of the tiered-testing procedure \nconsider effeds on marine organisms that are \nrepresentative of organisms that are indigenous to \nODMDSs and have known impad tolerances. In \nTier I, information on the proposed dredged \nmaterial\u2019s ,effect on laboratory and indigenous \nspecies is. analyzed. In Tier II, the theoretical \nbioaccumulation potential (TBP) for nonpolar \ninorganic contaminants in the dredged material is \ncalculated and compared against that of the refer- ence site. In Tier Ill, water-column toxicity, \nbenthic toxicity, and benthic bioaccumulation are \ndetermined for ecologically relevant laboratory \norganisms. In Tier IV, case-specific bioassays \nand bioaccumulation studies are conduded on \nlaboratory and/or field organisms. \n13.3.1.4 Suitability for /n-Place Pollutant \nControl \nThe 1991 Green Book was developed to \ndetermine water-column and bentbic LPC com- \npliance for proposed dredged material, not for \nin-place management of contaminated sediments. \nHowever, the physical, chemical, and biological \ntests that are recommend&d in the tiered-testing \nprocedure are readily adaptable to nondredging \nmanagement of sediments. \nThe sediment data that are generated with \nthe guidance in the manual must be of suffi- \nciently high quality to develop LPC determina- \ntions for the dredged material. If these data \nshow that the dredged material does oat meet \nthe LPC for ocean disposal, the same data are \nreadily adaptable to other sediment-management \nuses, including in-place pollutant management. \n13.3.1.5 Suitability for Source Control \nThe purpose of the detailed sampling and \ntesting guidance in the 1991 Green Book is to \nfully characterize the dredged material that is \nproposed for ocean disposal. Although it is not \nthe intended purpose, this characterization may \nbe useful for controlling sources of contaminants \nthat are entering the sediments. \nIf portions of a proposed project exceed the \nIPC, it benefits the applicant to isolate the com- \npliant and noncompliant areas to economize \nmanagement of the dredged material. For cxam- \nple, material that meets the LPC might be dis- \nposed of at an ODMDS and material that does \nnot meet the IJC might disposed of upland. \nDuring the process of site characterization, con- \ntaminant gradients and source locations might be \nidentified (such as occurred in New Bedford \nHarbor, Massachusetts) and remedial or enforce- \nment actions can be directed as appropriate. \n13-14 \nI3-\u201cGreen Book\u201d Sediment-Testing Approach \n13.3.1.6 Suitability for Disposal \nApplications \nAs discussed in Section 13.1 above, the \nguidance in the 1991 Green Book is used to \nconduct LPC evaluations, which are in turn \nused to support ocean-disposal management \ndecisions. The manual is not intended to pro- \nvide guidance on other disposal options avail- \nable to dredged-material managers. Some \nocean and nonocean disposal options may re- \nquire additional or alternative analyses of the \ndredged material to reach decision points. \nNumerous other guidance manuals on dredged- \nmaterial management are available from \nUSEPA and the USACE. \n133.2 General Advantages and Limitations \n13.3.2.1 Ease of Use \nAs discussed in Section 13.2.1 above, the \ntiered-testing procedure is relatively flexible. \nThe dredged-material evaluator can enter and \nexit the testing procedures at any tier. Howev- \ner, to begin the evaluation in Tier II, III, \u2018or IV, \nthe data must satisfy the requirements of the \nearlier tier(s). The overall ease of use of the \ntesting procedure depends on the evaluator\u2019s \nfamiliarity with the following: \nn Federal regulations pertinent to \ndredged-material testing and disposal; \nn Sources of existing dredged-material \n(sediment-quality) information; \nm Sampling design; \nn Numerical modeling; \nm Physical, chemical, and biological \ntesting; \nl Statistical analysis; and \nm Quality assurance. 13.3.2.2 Relative Cost \nTiers I, II, III, and IV are ordered by \nincreasing complexity and cost. Tier I is rela- \ntively inexpensive and consists solely of as- \nsembly and analysis of existing information. \nTier IV can be very expensive, consisting of \ncase-specific toxicity and bioaccumulation \nanalysis, including extensive field and labora- \ntory studies. However, significant time and \nresources can be saved if the earlier tiers are \ncompleted to the maximum extent possibie \nbefore proceeding to the later tier(s). For ex- \nample, an in-depth analysis of \u201cgrey literature\u201d \n(university reports, etc.) might show the possi- \nble existence of \u2018hot spots\u201d within a project. \nThe sampling plan could then be designed to \nappropriately sample these areas of concern \nduring a single sampling event, thereby saving \nthe time and expense required to conduct addi- \ntional sampling at a later time. Similarly, \nmoney and time will be saved if LPC compli- \nance for nonpolar organic contaminants can be \nshown in the Tier II TBP calculation rather \nthan in the Tier III laboratory testing and \nanalysis. \nAs all dredging \u2018projeds contain case-spe- \ncific components, it is difficult to estimate the \noverall cost of a typical dredged-material anal- \nysis. USEPA and the USACE predict that the \nupdated methods in the manual would not \ncause a significant increase in evaluation ex- \npenses and actually might lead to lower testing \ncosts because LPC determinations might be \nachieved earlier in the testing process, thereby \nmaking full-scale bioassay and bioaccumulation \nlaboratory tests unnecessary. Also, as the \nrecommended analy!ical methods become re- \nfined, market pressures will force costs lower. \n13.3.2.3 Tendency to Be Conservative \nAs discussed in Section 13.22 above, the \ntiered-testing procedure is very protective of \nhuman health and the marine environment. It \nis a sequential and comprehensive analysis of \nthe proposed dredged material\u2019s biological \neffects, as shown by previous studies, model- \n13-15 \nSediment Classijicutti Methods Compendium \ning, and laboratory testing. However, the \ntiered-testing procedure is an \u201cexpert system\u201d; \nthat is, the product of the procedure (LPC com- \npliance determination) is only as good as the \ninformation that is integrated into it. \nTo reach a defensible and ecologically \nsound LPC evaluation, high-quality information \nis required. There is risk of an inaccurate com- \npliance determination if incomplete or inac- \ncurate information is used, or if good informa- \ntion is misapplied. The regulations and numer- \nous references in the manual should be consult- \ned, and well-trained and experienced evaluators \nshould be involved throughout the decision- \nmaking process. \nX3.3.2.4 Level of Acceptance \nThe 1991 Green Book is the official \nUSEPA/USACE guidance manual for deter- \nmining the suitability of dredged material for \nocean disposal. During the development of the \nupdated manual, comments from USEPA and \nUSACE Headquarters, USEPA Regions, \nUSACE Districts, other federal agencies, port \nauthorities, special-interest groups, and the \ngeneral public were solicited, received, and \naddressed as appropriate. In 1990, USEPA and \nthe USACE conducted a public meeting on the \ndocument\u2019 and held six regional training ses- \nsions\u2019 on the updated methods. The final \nmanual is the product of extensive USEPA/ \nUSACE dredged material program experience, \ncurrent state-of-the-art testing methods, and \nreview by a wide array of individuals and \nagencies. \n13.3.2.5 Ability to Be Implemented by \nLaboratories with Typical \nEquipment and Handling Facilities \nMany evaluations recommended in the \n1991 Green Book, particularly for organic and \nchemical analysis, require standard laboratory \n\u2018Washington, DC. \n%amgansett, RI; Gulf Breeze, Q Vicksburg, MS; New- \nport, OR; San Fran&co, CA; and Washington, DC. equipment and handling facilities. However, \nsome laboratories have difficulty attaining \naccurate and precise test results for low con- \ntaminant concentrations. Agency and contract \nlaboratories that presently do not have the \ncapabilities to conduct precise analyses will \nhave to make significant investments in equip- \nment, personnel, and training. It is expected \nthat contract laboratories will choose to special- \nize in only a few methods to be efficient and \ncompetitive in the dredged-material testing \nmarket. Quality assurance (QA) program de- \nvelopment, although not equipment-intensive, is \nalso a necessary and significant investment for \ntesting laboratories. QA programs are neces- \nsary to ensure that sample and data integrity \nare of sufficient quality and defensible. \n13.3.2.6 Level of Effort Required to \nGenerate Results \nThe overall level of effort necessary to \nconduct dredged-material analysis is compar- \nable to that required by the preceding guidance \n(1977 Green Book). The level of effort is \nrelatively low in Tier I and relatively high in \nTiers Ill and IV. \n13.3.2.7 Degree to Which Results Lend \nThemselves to Interpretation \nThe analysis of raw data that are generated \nduring the tiered-testing procedure is relatively \ncomplex, especially for bioassay and bio- \naccumulation test data. Interpretation of results \nis specifically described and decision points \nand values. are clearly defined in the 1991 \nGreen Book. Section 13 of the manual, Statis- \ntical Methods, presents guidance for handling \nthe following: \nm Unequal numbers of experimental ani- \nmals assigned to each treatment con- \ntainer or loss of animals during the \nexperiment; \nn Unequal numbers of replications of the \ntreatments (i.e., containers or aquaria); \n13-16 \nX3- \u201cGreen Book \u201d Sediment-Testing Apprvach \nn Measurements scheduled for selected \ntime intervals but actually performed at \nother times; \nn Different conditions of salinity, pH, \ndissolved oxygen, temperature, etc., \namong exposure chambers; and \nm Differences in placement conditions of \nthe testing containers or in the animals \nassigned to different treatments. \nUSEPA and the USACE are presently develop- \ning software and additional guidance to facili- \ntate data interpretation for dredged-material \nevaluations. \n13.3.2.8 Degree of Environmental \nApplicability \nThe USEPA/USACE (1991) effects-based \napproach used to evaluate marine sediments has \nwide environmental and regulatory applicabil- \nity. The approach uses test organisms that \nn Are sensitive to impact; \nl Are reasonable representatives of indi- \ngenous ODMDS species; \nn Fulfill the species categories required \nby 40 CFR 227.27(c,d); \nn Have extensive test databases; and \nn Are hardy enough to withstand labora- \ntory procedures. \nAlternative test species that meet the guidance \nin the. 1991 Green Book may be used to avoid \ntesting problems such as grain-size tolerance \nand seasonal availability. Complete elucidation \nand quantification of all chemical components \nin the sediment are useful, but not required, for \nregulatory decision-making. The overall \napproach is environmentally conservative and \nrelatively economical. One feature of the 1991 Green Book guid- \nance posing environmental limitations is the \nnumerical modeling that is used in Tier I and II \nwater-column evaluations. The ADDAMS \nmodels are not suitable for calculating water- \ncolumn impacts at disposal sites that are \nextremely shallow (i.e., where the discharge \nperiod from the disposal vessel is longer than \nthe descent time to the bottom). Additionally, \nthere is some uncertainty about the applicabil- \nity of the models for extremely deep (a200 m) \nODMDSs. \n13.3.2.9 Degree of Accuracy and Precision \n\u201cIhe 1991 Green Book guidance strongly \nemphasizes the importance of a comprehensive \nQA program to. achieve sufficient data quality \nduring the tiered evaluation process. QA issues \nare addressed in subsections throughout the \ndata-generation sections of the manual, and \nSection 13, Quality-Assurance Consideration, \ngives guidance on the structure and compo- \nnents of QA programs and data-quality \nassessment. \nThe general guidance for QA program de- \nvelopment includes information on field and \nlaboratory sample handling, personnel training, \nand documentation. For chemical analyses, the \nguidance recommends appropriate use of ~neth- \nod blanks, procedural blanks, matrix \nspike/matrix-spike duplicates (MSSD), and \nstandard reference materials (SRM) to deta- \nmine accuracy and precision of the data. For \nbiological testing, the importance of control- \nsediment tests, reference-site tests, and refer- \nence-toxicant testing is discussed. \nWA fiTAlUS \nWA.1 Extait of Use \nTbe1991GreenBookguidancewillbeap \nplied to all evaluations for dredged material &at is \npfopo6e4f for disposal outside the baseline of the \ntenitorlal se8 (non-state waters).

Several large-scale, long-term \nUSEPAAJSACE projects in the New England and \nWest Coast regions have applied and improved on \nthe methods in the 1977 manual. \u20182be guidance in \nthe 1991 Green Book contains methods proven for \nmarine sediment analyses, developed for national \ntesting consistency, and organized into tiers for \nefficient compliance determination. \u2018Ibe tiered \napproach for environmental monitoring of aquatic \necosystems is strongly recommended by the \nNational Research Council (NRC, 1990). \n13.43 Reasons for IAmited Use \nOnly extreme time and resource constraints \n(national emergencies, etc.) would limit the use of \nthe guidance in the manual.

R. #3, Ladysmith, SC, Canada VOR 2E0 \nSediment quality criteria based on multiple \nmethods have been recommended for broad \napplications in the United States (USEPA/SAB, \n1989; Adams et al., in press). The approach used \nby the National Status and Trends Program \n(NSTP) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration (NOAA) to develop informal, \neffects-based guidelines involves the identification \nof the ranges in chemical concentrations associat- \ned with biological effects based on a weight of \nevidence from many studies. In this approach, the \ndata for many chemicals are assembled from \nmodeling, laboratory, and field studies to deter- \nmine the ranges in chemical concentrations that \nare rarely, sometimes, and usually associated with \ntoxicity. The data from many of the studies of the \nindividual approaches described elsewhere in this \ndocument are compiled and examined to develop \nno-effects, possible-effects, and probable-effects \nranges (Figure 14-1). \n14.1 SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS \n14.1.1 Current Use \nThe NSTP Approach was used initially to \ndevelop informal guidelines for use by the Nation- \nal Status and Trends (NS&T) Program (Long and \nMorgan, 1990; Long, 1992). NOM analyzes \nsediments from numerous locations nationwide as \na part of its monitoring program. The guidelines \nwere developed as tools for identifying locations \nin which there is a potential for toxicity to living resources for which NOAA is the federal steward. \nAreas in which chemical concentrations often \nexceeded the guidelines were identified as high \npriorities for investigations of toxicity with biolog- \nical tests. \nEnvironment Canada evaluated many candi- \ndate approaches to the development of sediment \nquality guidelines and elected to develop its \nnational guidelines using the NSTP Approach \n(MacDonald and Smith, 1991; MacDonald et al., \n1991). The Florida Department of Environmental \nRegulation elected to use the NSTP Approach to \ndevelop state sediment quality guidelines as a part \nof its sediment management strategy (MacDonald, \n1992). The California Water Resources Control \nBoard will use the NOM guidelines in its initial \nevaluations of ambient chemical data. Following \nthat step, data from field studies, laboratory \nbioassays, and equilibrium partitioning models \nwill be used to develop sediment -quality objec- \ntives (Lorenzato et al., 1991). Finally, the Inter- \nnational Council for Exploration of the Sea Study \nGroup on the Biological Significance of Contami- \nnants in Marine Sediments has elected to adopt \nthe NSTP Approach in the development of guide- \nlines for participating nations (Dr. Herb Windom, \nWorking Group on Marine Sediments, ICES, \npersonal communication), \nGuidelines developed with the NSTP Ap- \nproach were used by NOAA to identify chemicals \nthat occurred in concentrations that were suffi- \nciently high to warrant concern and to identify \nsampling sites and areas in which there was a \npotential for toxicity (Long and Morgan, 1990; \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \n100 \nFrequency Distribution \nof Effects (percentile) \n50 \n10 \n0 Possible Effects Probable Effects \nERL ERM \nChemical Concentration \nFigure 14-1 Conceptual outline of the relationship between the NSTP Approach guidelines and the no-effects, possible effects, and \nprobable-effects ranges in chemical concentrations. \n14-2 \n1ANSTP Approach \nLong et al., 1991; Iong and Markel,. 1992). It \nwas presumed that the potential for toxicity was \nrelatively high in areas where numerous chemicals \nexceeded the upper bounds of the guidelines. \nLikewise, it was assumedthat the potential for \ntoxicity was relalively low in areas where none of \nthe chemical concentrations exceeded the lower \nbounds of the guidelines. In those regions with \nthe highest potential for toxicity, NOAA has \nimplemented regional surveys of toxicity; using a \nbattery of biological analyses and tests. \nAlso, NOAA has used the guidelines in \nassessments and prioritization of hazardous waste \nsites (Dr. Alyce Fritz, NOAA Hazardous Materials \nResponse and Assessment Division, personal \ncommunication). Other agencies and consultants \nhave used the guidelines as a means of placing \nambient chemical data into perspective with \nrespect to the potential for toxicity (for example, \nSquibb et al., 1991 for New York/New Jersey \nHarbor; Mannheim and Hathaway, 1991 for \nBoston Harbor; Soule et al., 1991 for Marina Del \nRey). The Florida Department of Environmental \nRegulation has used the guidelines as informal \ntools for interpreting ambient chemical data and \nfor identifying regional priorities for sediment \nquality management (MacDonald, 1992). \n14.13 Potential Use \nPotential uses of the guidelines are as follows: \nB Identification of potentially toxic chemi- \ncals in ambient sediments; \nn Ranking and prioritization of areas and \nsampling sites for further investigation; \nn Assessment of potential ecological haz- \nards of contaminated sediments; \nn Design of spiked-sediment bioassay ex- \nperiments; \nn Description of the kinds of toxic effects \npreviously associated with specific con- \ncentrations of chemicals; n Quantification of the relative likelihood of \ntoxicity mer specific ranges in chemical \nconcentrations; and \nW Identification of the need for sediment \nmanagement initiatives. \n14.2 DESCRXPTION \n14.2.1 Description of Method \nThe N!STP Approach involves a simple evalu- \nation of available data to identify three ranges in \nconcentrations for each chemical: \nl No-Effects Range: The range in concen- \ntrations over which toxic effects are rarely \nor never observed; \nB Possible-Effects Range: T&e range in \nconcentrations over which toxic effe& \nare occasionally observed, and \nn Probable-Effects Range: The range in \nconcentrations over which toxic effects \nare frequently or always observed. \nThese ranges are identified by evaluating \ninformation from numerous studies in which \nmatching biological and chemical data were \ndeveloped. The specific steps in the method are: \n(1) Compile matching chemical and biologi- \ncal data from laboratory spiked-sediment \nbioassays, equilibrium-partitioning mod- \nels, and field studies and determine the \nchemical concentrations associated with \nno observed effects and those associated \nwith adverse effects. \n(2) Enter the data into a database, including \nthe type of biological test performed, the \nadverse effect(s) measured, the chemical \nconcentrations associated with observa- \ntions of either effects or no effects, the \ntype of study method and approach, and \nthe degree of concordance between the \n14-3 \nScdimen t Classification Methods Compendium \nmeasure of effects and the concentration \nof the chemical. \n(3) For those analytes for which sufficient \ndata exist, prepare data tables sorted \naccording to ascending chemical concen- \ntrations. \n(4) Arithmetically determine the no-effects \nrange, possible-effects range, and prob- \nable-effects range for each chemical. \nThe steps taken to select and screen candi- \ndate data sets are described in Section \n14.2.1.2.3. The approach is intended to encour- \nage periodic updates as new data become avail- \nable. \nTwo slightly different methods have been \nused to determine the three chemical ranges. \nFirst, two percentiles in the chemical concentra- \ntions associated with toxicity were derived by \nLong and Morgan (1990): the lower 10th per- \ncentile and the 50th percentile (median). The \nlower 10th percentile was identified as the \nEffects Range-Low (ERL), and the median was \nidentified as the Effects Range-Median (ERM). \nIn their evaluation of the ascending data tables, \nLong and Morgan (1990) used only the chemical \nconcentrations that had been associated with \ntoxicity (i.e., the \u201ceffects\u201d data). The conceptual \nbasis for this approach and the three ranges are \nillustrated in Figure 14-2. \nLater, MacDonald (1992) identified the three \nranges with a method that used both the concen- \ntrations associated with biological effects (the \n\u201ceffects\u201d data) and those associated with no \nobserved effects (the \u201cno-effects\u201d data). In this \nmethod, a threshold effects level (TEL) was \ncalculated first as the square root of the product \nof the lower 15th-percentile concentration asso- \nciated with observations of biological effects \n(the ERL) and the 50thpercentile concentration \nof the no-observed-effects data (the NER-M). A \nsafety factor of 0.5 was applied to the TEL to \ndefine a No-Observable-Effects Level (NOEL). \nNext, a Probable-Effects Level (PEL) was \ncalculated as the square root of the product of \nthe SOth-percentile concentration of the effects data (the ERM) and the 85th-percentile concen- \ntration of the no effects data (the NER-M). \nNeither of these methods is preferred or \nadvocated over the other. The significant fea- \nture of this approach is the use of a weight of \nevidence developed in the ascending tables, not \nin the specific method of using the da& tables. \nIn addition to the two metbods described here, \nmany others could be applied to the ascending \ndata tables to derive guidelines. The method \nused by MacDonald (1992) considered both the \n\u201ceffects\u201d and \u201cno-effects\u201d data, whereas that of \nLong and Morgan (1990) used only the \u201ceffects\u201d \ndata. Different percentiles in tbe ascending data \nwere used in the two methods. Despite these \ndifferences in the methods, the agreement be- \ntween the NOELs and ERLs and between tbe \nPELS and the ERMs was very good, usually \nwithin a factor of 2. \nIn both documents, the lower of the two \nguidelines for each chemical was assumed to \nrepresent the concentration below which toxic \neffects rarely occurred. The range in concentra- \ntions between the two values was that in which \neffects occasionally occurred. Toxic effects \nusually or frequently occurred at concentrations \nabove the upper guideline value. \nAs an example, ,Figure 14-2 compares the \nfrequency distribution of toxic effects and no- \neffects data associated with concentrations of \nnapthtbalene to the ERL and ERM concentra- \ntions for napbthalene. Long and Morgan (1990) \nreported the ERL as 340 ppb dry wt. and the \nERM as 2100 ppb dry wt. for naphthalene, \nbased on an ascending data table of 49 data \npoints. These guidelines defined three ranges of \nchemical concentrations: the no-effects range \n(O-340 ppb); the possible-effects range \n(340-2100 ppb); and the probable-effects range \n(~2100 ppb). Only 10.5 percent of the chemicat \nconcentrations below the ERL were associated \nwith toxic effects; suggesting that toxicity is \nunlikely below the ERL concentrations. In \ncontrast, 81 percent of the chemical concentra- \ntions between the ERL and ERM values were \nassociated with the toxic effects and 93 percent \nof the data points were associated with toxicity \nat concentrations above the \u2018ERM value. \nNo Bffects Possible Effects \n0 340 2100 \nNaphthalene (ppb) \nflgun 14-2 hquency dlstributhw of naphthalene concentration wsodated with toxic effects below the ERL value, between the ERL \nend ERM v&es, nd above the ERM vdua (from hg l nd Morgan, looo). \nSediment Classification Methods Compendium \n14.2.1.1 Objecfives and Assumptions \nThe objective of the NSTP Approach is to \nprovide informal, effects-based guidelines that \nare based on a weight of evidence and reported \nas ranges in concentrations. The guidelines are \nbased on chemical concentrations associated \nwith measures of biological effects, thereby \nproviding toxicological and/or biological releva- \nnce to the guidelines. They are based on data \nfrom multiple studies and research methods, thus \nproviding a weight of evidence. In recognition \nof the variability in the kinds of data that are \navailable, they are presented as ranges, instead \nof absolute values, thereby providing a flexible \ninterpretive tool with broad applicability. They \nare presented along with all of the supporting \nevidence in ascending tables, providing tbe user \nan interpretive framework for comparison with \nambient data. \nIn this approach it is assumed that tbe data \nfrom all individual studies are equal in weight and \ncredibility, although they may have involved very \ndifferent methods and test endpoints. It is as- \nsumed that the methods used by the individual \ninvestigators were reasonably accurate. Most \nimportant, it is assumed that as the concentrations \nincrease, the potential for toxicity also increases, \nthereby providing a conceptual basis for identify- \ning the ranges in concentrations frequently associ- \nated with no toxic effects and those frequently \nassociated with toxic effects. The guidelines can \nbe formulated to account for site-specific factors \nthat control bioavailability (see Section 14.3.1.1). \n14.2.1.2 Level of Eflort \n14.2.1.2.1 Type of Sampling Required \nThe NSTP Approach relies on the use of a \ndatabase compiled from a wide variety of sedi- \nment quality assessments. The database currently \ncontains over 800 entries generated by the three \nmajor approaches to the establishment of effects- \nbased guidelines: equilibrium-partitioning models; \nlaboratory spiked-sediment bioassays; and various \nassessments of matching, field-collected, sediment \nchemistry, and biological effects data, The NSTP Approach was specifically designed to use existing \ndata, therefore eliminating or minimizing the need \nfor additional sampling. However, evaluation of \nthe regional applicability of the guidelines could, \nin some cases, require further site-specific investi- \ngations, the magnitude of which could vary con- \nsiderably. \n14.2.1.2.2 Methods \nThe methods for deriving numerical sediment \nquality guidelines using the NSTP Approach are \nsummarized in Section 14.2.1. Also, these meth- \nods are described by Long and Morgan (1990) and \nMacDonald (1992). \n14.2.1.2.3 Types of Data Required \nThe NSTP Approach was intended to integrate \na diverse assortment of information into a single \ndatabase to support the derivation of numerical \nguidelines. Consequently, data from numerous \nmodeling, laboratory, and field studies were \ncollated into one database. Ideally, the database \nused to establish guidelines should include entries \nfrom all three of these types of approaches. \nSuitable data were available from a wide variety \nof sources. While collection and analysis of these \ndata sets were labor-intensive, subsequent, inue- \nmental updates of the database should be relative- \nly simple and inexpensive. \nThe data compiled from numerous studies \nwere entered into the Biological Effects Database \nfor Sediments (BEDS) by MacDonald (1992). All \nof the compiled data were fully evaluated prior to \nincorporation into the BEDS to ensure internal \nconsistency in the database. The screening proce- \ndures used to support the development of the \n3EDS were designed to ensure that only relevant \nand highquality data were used to derive the \nguidelines. No subjective biases were employed \nin screening the data; as many sources of data \nwere included as possible. Candidate data from \neach study were evaluated to determine the ac- \nceptability of the experimental design, the test \nprotocols, the analytical methods, and the statisti- \ncal procedures that were used. Only data in which \nthere were matched measures of sediment chemjs- \nIANSTP Approach \ntry and biological effects were included. The \ndatabase included only those data in which either \nstatistically significant biological results were \nobtained or in which major differences in the \nbiological results between samples were reported. \nThe BEDS currently includes over 800 data \nentries, mainly data from studies performed \nthroughout North America. It was developed \njointly by NOAA, Florida Department of Environ- \nmental Regulation, Environment Canada, and \nMacDonald Environmental Services L&l. \nIn the evaluation of candidate data from field \nstudies, only those data were used in which at \nleast a lo-fold difference in the concentrations of \nat least one chemical among the samples was \nreported. Once this criterion was met, the data \nfrom many of the field studies were evaluated to \ndetermine the mean chemical concentrations in \ntoxic samples (i.e., significantly different from \ncontrols) and those in nontoxic samples or in \nsamples with relatively depauperate benthic corn- \nmunities (i.e., those with low abundance or species \nrichness) versus those with more robust communi- \nties. Further, those mean concentrations in biolog- \nically affected samples that exceeded by twofold \nor more the mean concentrations in the back- \nground, reference, or nonaffected samples were \nassigned an asterisk in the ascending tables. The \nasterisks symbolized that a biological effect was \nnoted and that there was a strong association \nbetween the chemical gradient and the biological \ngradient. Concentrations associated with nontoxic \nreference conditions were noted as \u201cno effects.\u201d \nThose in which there was no concordance between \nthe measures of effects and chemical concentra- \ntions were noted as \u201cno gradient\u201d or \u201cno concor- \ndance.\u201d The concentrations derived in the model- \ning and spiked-sediment bioassays were always \nassigned asterisks. The concentrations with \nasterisks were used as \u2018effects\u201d data by both Long \nand Morgan (1990) and MacDonald (1992). \n14.2.1.2.4 Necessary Hardware and Skills \nl\u2019be primary skills required to derive guidelines \nare associated with the development of the database. \nExpertise is required to evaluate the suitability of the \nbiological and chemistry data, using the screening criteria. This process requires experience in the \nevaluation of sediment data and the methods that \nwere used to develop the data. \nThe database has been developed on a personal \ncomputer and is readily transferable to other sys- \ntems, but requires knowledge of the use of a oom- \nputer. \u2018l\u2019he database provides a means of storing \nand accessing all of the information that relates \nchemical concentrations to adverse biological ef- \nfeds. This information can be manipulated in Uris \nenvironment or exported into other formats. \n14.2.1.3 Adequacy OfLlocrmrenti \nThe NSTP Approach was documented by Lrng \nand Morgan (1990), in which the approach \u2018was \npeer-reviewed both within and outside NOA& A \nsecond printing of the document was issued in 1992, \nfollowing further review. A synopsis of the ap \npreach was descrii in a scientific journal (Long, \n1992). The approach has been descrii orally in \nnumerous technical and scientific forums. Mac- \nDonald and Smith (1991) and MacDonald et cll. \n(1991) desaii the application of the approach in \nthe development of guidelines for Canada. Mac- \nDonald (1992) descrii the use of the approach in \na statewide sediment management strategy for \nFlOriQ. \n14S.2 ApplkabWy of Method to H-II \nHealth, Aquatic I.&z, or WMlife \nPx-dedhn \n\u2018Ibe guidelines are intended to povide an esti- \nmate of the potential for adverse biological effects of \nsediment-associated contaminants ar benthic organ- \n~ba&onaweightofevi&ncefromanalyses \nperformed with multiple species and/or biological \ncommunitie5.

The axxnd- \n14-7 \nSediment Ciassijication Methods Compendium \ning tables accunpanying the guidelines also provide \na supplementary basis for interptiing new ambient \ncbtical data. Ako, these tables provide a visual and \nstatistical means of estimating tbe relative degree of \ncertainty in lhe guidelines. \n\u2018I%e guidelines are not intended to be used for the \nprokction of human life or wildlife. Rather, they are \nintended to be used in est*ating the potential for \nadverse effects among benthic communities. \n14.23 AbllityofMetbodtoGenmtc \nNumdcd Crittxia for Specifk \nChemkak \nkg and Morgan (1990) reported numerical \nguidelines for 41 chemicals, including 12 trace \nmetals, 18 polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons \n(PAHQ, and 11 synthetic organic compounds. \nMacDonald (1992) developed guidelines for 9 trace \nmetals, total PCS, 13 PAHs, 3 classes of PAHs, and \n2 pesucides. \nGrmplually, guidelines derived using this \napproach could be developed for any toxic chemical, \nprovided sufficient data exist and provided the \ntoxicity of the ckrnical is doseresponsive. Long and \nMorgan (1990) assigned a high degree of a&idence \nto gui&lines for ckmicals for which data existed \nCan many different approaches, different regiq \nand in which there was a good agreement in the data \nhn different studies. MacDonald (1!392) calculated \nguidelines only for those chemicals for which there \nwas a minimum of 40 data points, after determining \nthe minimum amount of data necessq to calculate \nreliable and consistent values. These minimum data \nrequirements were established by iteratively calculat- \ning guidelines using data sets of increasing size (e.g., \n4 to 60 data points) and determining when the \nestimate of the guidelines stabilized. \n143 USEFUTAE!S \n143.1 Ewiro~~ntal Applicability \n143.1.1 Sui&biLity for Diferent &xGnent lopes \nThe NSI\u2019P Approach can be applied equally to \nany sediment type that occurs in fkshwater, estuarine, \nand marine environments. Since the database that supports the guidelines amtains information fian a \nwide variety of sediment types, the resultant guide \nlines are considered to be widely applicable. An \nincreasing amount of information suggests that the \nbioavailabitity, and, therefore, toxicity, of many \ncontaminantsisconlrolledbysu&factorsasTOC, \nAVS, and grain size. \u2018Ibe BEDS aa~ently accun- \nmodatestbedarafortbesevariable&;and,auW \nquemtly, the guidelines could be- namalized to the \nappropriate faders that a~trol bioavailability. \nHawever, insufficjent information cum~Iy exists to \nderive guidelinea~that are expressed in these terms. \nIt is anticipated that future revisions of the guidelines \nwill be expressed in lhese temq thereby increasing \ntheir applicability. \nPartly to increase the &ability of the guidelines \nto different sediment types, they are eqessed as \nranges in owcentralions, not absolutes. These ranges \npovide a basis for evaluating chemical concentratks \nin the different types of sediments repreamted in the \nBEDS. In addition, the asamding data tables used to \ngenerate the guidelines can be examined to calculate \nfrequency distriiutions of effects and no effecis \nwithin each range of concentrations. Ikse fkquency \ndislriiutions an be used as estimates of the pfobabili- \nty of toxic effeds. \n14.3.X.2 Suhbility for Differeent Chemicals \nor Classes of CkmicaLr \nThe approach can be applied to a wide variety \nof chemicals for which analytical methods are \navailable. Thus far, numerical guidelines have \nbeen developed by hng and Morgan (1990) and \nby MacDonald (1992) for 43 and 28 chemicals or \nclasses of chemicals, respectively. Data are \nincluded in the BEDS for over 200 chemicals or \nclasses of chemicals. Guidelines could be devel- \noped for all of these substances when sufficient \ninformation becomes available. \n14.3.1.3 Suitability for Predicting Eficts on \nDiflerent Organisms \nSince the database compiled from many \ndifferent studies is based on tests or analyses \nperformed with many different species, the guide- \nlines are widely applicable ti benthic organisms. \n1ASTP Appronch \nIn addition, the species studied in each investiga- \ntion is(are) listed in the database; therefore, \nspecies-specific applicability can be evaluated by \nthe users. Furthermore, the ERL values often are \nbased on data from relatively sensitive species or \nlife stages, and, therefore, can be used as guide- \nlines suitable for the protection of sensitive spe- \ncies. \n14.3.1.4 Suitability for In-Place Polkant \nControl \nNumerical sediment guidelines developed \nusing the NSTP Approach can be used in a variety \nof ways as a tool in pollutant control. Specifical- \nly, these assessment tools respond to regulatory \nrequirements by: \nn Providing a basis for evaluating existing \nsediment chemistry data and ranking areas \nof concern and chemicals of concern in \nterms of their potential for causing toxici- \nty and \nn Identifying the need for further investiga- \ntions, such as biological testing, to sup- \nport regulatory decisions. \nAs is the case with all of the other approaches \nthat rely on data collected in the field, the guide- \nlines derived using the N!XP Approach integrate \ninformation obtained from studies of complex \nmixtures of contaminants and thereby consider \ntheir interactive effects. Consideration of the \neffects of contaminant mixtures is an advantage in \nthe assessment of in-place pollutants in real-world \nconditions. However, this approach also relies on \nand gives equal weight to the data from equili- \nbrium-partitioning models and laboratory spiked- \nsediment bioassays performed with single chemi- \ncals (see Section 14.2.1.1). \n14.3.1.5 Suitability for Source Control \nA reasonable amount of confidence in sedi- \nment quality guidelines is needed to justify using \nthem in source control adions. Since the guide- \nlines are developed with a weight of evidence compiled from many different studies, they pro- \nvide a credible and defensible basis for evaluating \ncontaminants in real-world conditions. Ihe \nguidelines provide an efficient basis for identify- \ning priority chemicals and priority areas that \nwould benefit from source controls. In addition, \nthe ascending tables provide a basis for estimating \nthe probability of observing adverse effects at sites \nof interest, reducing the probability of effeds \nthrough source controls, and evaluating the im- \nprovements in sediment quality following the \nimplementation of source control measures. \n14.3.1.6 Suitability for Dredged Material \nDisposal Applications \nNeither the numerical guidelines nor the \nframework that have been developed for their \napplication are intended to replace aaxpted testing \nprotocols for dredged material disposal evalua- \ntions. Nonetheless, these guidelines can provide \nrelevant tools for estimating the potential for \nadverse biological effects of contaminants associ- \nated with solid-phase sediments. \n143.2 Gemen Advmhges l d Dludvmhgee \n14.3.2.1 Ease of Use \nThe approach has the advantage of relying on \nexisting data. Tberefore, guidelines am be devtl- \noped relatively quickly and easily. \n\u2018The original efforts by Long and Morgan (1990) \nand MacDonald (1992) to assemble the databasea \nused to develop the guidelines were labas-intemive. \nNumerous reports and data sets were located, md a \nhuge amount of data was entered into spreadshe \nHowever, these data now exist in a central&d, \ncomputerized database, the BEDS. Subsequent \ndexivations of guidelines based on iterative upan- \nsions of the BEDS database should be relatively \nquick, easy, and inexpensive. \n\u2018I%e guidelines are easily used and interpr&d \n@xxkal data can be readily cunpnred with the \nguidelines and with the -ding tables. The fre \nquemy of occurrena of toxicity over the no-&f* \npo&ble+ffects, and probable-effects ranges can be \ncalculated and compared with the chemical data. \nSafiment Classification Methods Compendium \nSediments in which numerous chemicals occur at \nconcentrations that fall within the probable-effects \nranges have a higher probability of being toxic than \nthose in which most of the chemical concentrations \nare within the no-effects range. This type of simple \ninterpretation makes the guidelines very easy to use. \n14.322 Relatiw Cost \nThe original effart of Long and Morgan (1990) \ninvolved roughly one year of labor. \u201cfbe confinna- \ntion and expansion of the database by MacDonaId \n(1992) involved more than another year of labor. \nThe costs of subsequent iterations of the guidelines \nbased on further expansions of the database would \nvary with the amount of data entered and the num- \nber of chemicals. The calculations of the guideline \nvalues themselves are very simple and quick. Also, \nthe guidelines can be used very quickly and easily. \nIf the necessary data are not available for entry \ninto a database, then the costs to generate them \ncould be relatively high. If initiated de nouo, \nmodeling, bioassay, and field studies necessary to \ngenerate sufficient data could vary considerabIy in \ncosts and time, depending on the amount of data \nneeded. \n14.23 Tendency to Be Cmservative \nThe predictive capabilities of the guidelines \nhave not been independently quantified. The \nprotectiveness of the guidelines could be increased \nby considering data only from chronic sublethal \nendpoints or by applying a numerical safety factor, \nsuch as was applied in the Florida guidelines (Mac- \nDonald, 1992). Also, the guidelines would become \nmore conservative if data were included only from \nareas in which toxicants were highly bioavailable. \n14.3.2.4 Level of Acceptance \n7he NSTP Approach has been published by \nNOAA, following an in-house and outside peer \nreview. It has been published in a peer-reviewed \nscientific journal. The approach has been used by \nEnvironment Qnada and Florida Department of \nEnvironmental Regulation in the development of \ntheir respective guidelines. It has been adopted by a committee of the International Council for Explo- \nration of the Sea for use by member nations. \u2018Xbe \nState of California has adopted a similar approach to \nthe development of sediment quality objectives \n(Imenzato et al., 1991). \nThe numerical guidelines developed by use of \nthe approach have been used by NOAA to compare \nand rank the potential for toxicity at monitoring sites \nnationwide, within San Francisco Bay, and within \nTampa Bay. Approximately &O copies of the \nreport by Long and Morgan (1990) have been \ndistributed. Users of the report have compared \nambient concentrations with the guidelines in \nassessments of hazardous waste sites, analyses of \nprospective dredge material, evaluations of survey \nand monitoring data., and estimates of ecological risk \n(for example, Mannheim and Hathaway, 1991; \nSoule et uf., 1991; Squibb et al., 1991). NOM \nroutinely uses the guidelines in its estimates of \necological risk at National priority List hazardous \nwaste sites. \u2018lhe guidelines have been used as a \nbasis for interpretation of chemical data in court \ncases. \n14.3.2.5 Ability to Be Implemented by \nLaboratories with Typical \nEquipment and Handling Facilities \nThe spreadsheets and database needed to \ngenerate the guidelines can be prepared with a \npersonal computer and need not be very compli- \ncated. Entry of data into the database and the \ngeneration of the asending tables are very simple. \nThe calculations of the guidelines can be per- \nformed manually, on a desk-top calculator or a \npersonal computer. IIre database can be supple- \nmented with new data as they become available. \nImplementation of the approach can become more \nlaborious and complicated if the necessary data \nmust be generated de rwvo. \n24.3.2.6 Level of Effort Required to \nGenerate Results \nAs outlined in Section 14.3.2.2, the level of \neffort required in the development of the original \nset of guidelines was relatively bigh. Subsequent \niterations of the guidelines for other purposes, \n14-10 \nlA?JSTP Apoach \nother chemicals, or for the same chemicals follow- \ning additions to the database would be relatively \nf=Y* Entry of new data points from spiked- \nsediment bioassays, equilibrium-partitioning \nmodels, or apparenl effects thresholds into the \ndatabase would require only a few minutes. \nManipulation of raw matching data from biologi- \ncal and chemical analyses performed in a field \nstudy would require from a few hours lo several \ndays, depending on the size of the data set, fol- \nlowed by entry of the data points into the data- \nbase. \n14.3.2.7 Degree to Which Resulfs Lend \nThemselves to Interpretation \nThe guidelines and the ascending data tables \non which they are based can be used in a number \nof ways. First, the data from analyses of ambient \nsamples can be compared visually with the two \nnumerical guidelines to determine whether the \nambient concentrations exceed either of the guide- \nlines. Second, the ambient concentrations can be \ncompared with the data in the ascending tables to \ndetermine the kinds of toxic effects that have been \nobserved in previous studies at tbe concentrations \nof concern. Finally, the frequencies of toxicity in \nthe no-effects, possible-effects, and probable- \neffects ranges can be used to predict the probabil- \nity of toxicity associated with any contaminant \nconcentration. \nThe guidelines developed thus far with this \napproach do not account for the effects of factors \nthat control bioavailability of the toxicants. This \nis not a weakness of the approach; rather, it is a \nweakness of the available data. Nevertheless, this \nwealmess may hinder interpretation of ambient \ndata with the guidelines, The BEDS database \nincludes a provision for entering data from analy- \nses of acid volatile sulfides and total organic \ncarbon (and other potential normalizers) and, \ntherefore, would lend itself to recalculation of \nguidelines normalized to these factors once the \nnecessary data become available. \nAn important strength of this approach is that \nit provides the user some flexibility in the use and \ninterpretation of the guidelines. All of the data \nare provided in ascending order for the user to see and evaluate. The degree of certainty in the data \ncan be assessed and judged by the user. Ranges \nin concentrations are provided, instead of rigid, \nsingle absolute values. \nOne of the most attractive features of this \napproach is the estimation of the probability of \nbiological effects, based on the frequency distribu- \ntions of effects for each chemical. For example, \nthe data in the BEDS database indicate that only \n5.8 percent of the chemical concentrations within \nthe no-effects range for cadmium (0 to 1 mg/kg) \ndetermined by MacDonald (1992) were associated \nwith adverse biological effects (Figure 14-3). \nThese data suggest that there is a low probability \nof observing adverse effects within this range. \nWithin the probable effects range for cadmium \n(~7.5 mg/kg), roughly 68 percent of the database \nentries were associated with adverse effects. \nThese data suggest that there is a relatively high \nprobability of observing adverse effects within this \nrange. Positive concordance between frequency of \neffects and chemical concentrations should inspire \nconfidence in the guideline values. \nEvaluation of the guidelines for mercury \nreveals that a lower level of confidence should be \nplaced on the guidelines for this element. The \ndata in the BEDS database indicate that within the \nno-effects range (0 to 0.1 mg/kg), roughly 7 \npercent of the entries were associated with adverse \neffects (Figure 14-4). However, frequency distri- \nbutions of effects are similar within the possible- \neffects range (0.1 to 1.4 mg/kg) and the probable- \neffects range (~1.4 mg/kg), namely 30.1 percent \nand 33.3 percent, respectively. Therefore, it is \nmore difficult to adequately determine the unac- \nceptable levels of mercury in sediments than with, \nsay, cadmium. \n14.3.2.8 Degree of Environmental \nApplicability \nThe guidelines are highly applicable to the \ninterpretation of environmental data. They are \ngenerated with data from environmentally realistic \nfield studies, as well as theoretical modeling \nstudies and controlled laboratory experiments. \nThey are generated with data from many differeat \nregions in which the mixtures and concentrations \nSediment Classifktion Methods Compendium \n% of data > or < concentration \n60 - \nNo Effects Possible \nEffects \n50 - 5.8% Hits \n\u2019 26% Hits \n40 - \n30 - \n20 - \n10 - \n0 ! \u2019 \u201c\u201c\u201c\u2019 I I I '1\"' I I 'III \n0.01 0.1 1 \nConcentration \n- No Effects -t - Effects Probable Effects \n68.2% Hits + \nI\u201d I I I \"\"'1 I I \"'I( \n10 1.00 1 \n(ug/d 00 \n14-12 \nIAhrSTP Approach \n60 \n50 \n40 \n30 \n20 \n10 \n0 % of data > or < concentration \nNo Effects \n7% Hits Possible Effects \n30.1% Hit+\u201d .

They are generated with tests \nusing differeni species with different sensitivities \nto toxicants. They are universally applicable in \nNortb America since they were generated with \ndata from many regions in the United Stales and \nCanada. Confidence in the utility of the guide- \nlines is inspired by the weight of evidence from \nthese multiple studies. \n14.3.2.9 Degree of Accuracy and Precision \nBy iteratively adding and removing different \ndata sets from the ascending tables, MacDonald \n(1992) determined that a minimum of 40 data sets \nwere needed to develop consistent and reliable \nguidelines. Clearly, some variability in the guide- \nlines is to be expected as data are added or deiet- \ned, but, once the minimum amount of data is \ncompiled, this variability appears to be minimal. \nMacDonald (1992) generally doubled or \ntripled the amount of data in the ascending tables \ncompiled by Long and Morgan (1990) mainly \nwith new data from field studies and laboratory \nspiked-sediment bioassays. Also, MacDonald \n(1992) considered only estuarine and marine data, \nthereby deleting the freshwater data included in \nLong and Morgan (1990). The effects on the \nguideline concentrations of eliminating some data \nand adding a substantial amount of new data are \nillustrated in Tables 14-1 and 14-2. The ERL and \nERM values, based on the Long and Morgan \n(1990) data tables and the larger MacDonald \n(1992) tables, are compared by using the methods \nof Long and Morgan (1990) applied to both data \nsets. \nFor 13 aromatic hydrocarbons, the average of \nthe ratios between the two sets of guidelines was \n1.5 (1.9 for the ERb and 1.2 for the ERMs). For \neight trace metals, the average of the ratios be- \ntween the two sets of guidelines was 1.7. The \ntrace metals ERL values changed more than the \nERM values (average ratios of 1.9 for the ERLs \nand 1.5 for the ERMs). \nOverall, 7 of the 23 ERL values did not \nchange and the ratios between the two sets of \nERL values ranged from 1.0 to 9.4, Also, 7 of \nthe 23 ERM values did not change. Of the 46\u2019 values, 14 remained unchanged, 17 increased, and \n15 decreased. The overall mean factors of change \nwere less than twofold for both trace metals and \nPAHs. These observations suggest that the guide- \nlines are not terribly sensitive to the addition of \nnew data once a minimum amount has been \ncompiled. Also, they suggest that the guidelines \noriginaliy developed by Long and Morgan (1990) \ngenerally are substantiated by additional data \ncompiled by MacDonald (1992). \nThe accuracy of the guidelines in predicting \ntoxicity bas not ,yet been quantified. However, in \nthe Hudson-Raritan estuary, the concentrations of \nmany chemicals quantified in previous studies \n(Squibb et al., 1992) frequently exceeded the \nERM guidelines in the Artbur Kill and rarely \nexceeded them in the lower Hudson River. In a \nrecent survey funded by NOAA, sediments from \nthe Arthur Kill were extremely toxic to amphipods \nand other species, whereas the sediments from the \nlower Hudson River were not toxic. \n14.4 STATUS \n14.4.1 Extent of Use \nThe NSTP Approach is being used by \nNOAA\u2019s National Status and Trends Program, by \nEnvironment Canada, and by the Florida Depart- \nment of Environmental Regulation. A variation \non the approach is being pursued by the California \nWater Resources Control Board. Other states and \nregional districts have inquired about the possible \nuse of the approach. \n14.4.2 Extent to Which Appro8ch Has Been \nField-Validated \nValidations of the guidelines have not yet \nb&n quantified.

Additional opportunities to \nfield-validate the guidelines will be available in \nfulure studies in Tampa Bay, the Hudson-Raritan \nesluary, and southern California. \n14.43 Reasons for Limited Use \nThe NSTP Approach initially was used by \nNOAA to develop informal guidelines for internal \nagency use. Therefore, knowledge of and access \nto the guidelines was limited. As interest in the \nguidelines increased, they were released in a \ngovernment document with a limited distribution. \nTherefore, the main reason for the limited use of \nthe approach has been the limited awareness of its \nexistence. Furthermore, the equiitbrium-partition- \ning approach to national criteria and the most \nsuccessful regional approach to criteria (apparent \neffects thresholds in Washington) have received \nconsiderable attention. Moreover, the guidelines \nthus far have not considered the potential for \nbioavailability or bioaccumulation because of a \nlack of data. \n14.4.4 Outlook for Future Use and Amount \nof Development Yet Needed \nThere is significant potential for the expanded \nuse of the NSTP Approach. Canada, Florida, and \nCalifornia currently are using the approach to \ndevelop their respective guidelines. Since the \napproach relies on existing data, other region- \nspecific guidelines could be developed easily, \nusing the data available from specific regions. \nThe approach can be used to validate criteria \ndeveloped with other single-method approaches. \nThe database can be accessed for specific regions \nor for fresh, estuarine, or marine waters. \nSeveral types of data are needed to further \ndevelop the approach. First, additional data are \nneeded from studies in which TOC, grain size, \nand acid volatile sulfides were measured. Second, \nadditional data are needed from spiked-sediment \nbioassays to establish cause-effect relationships. \nThird, additional data are needed from field \nstudies in which very strong chemical gradients \nwere observed. These studies should include measures of the toxicity and chemical contamina- \ntion of bulk sediments and pore water. lhey \nwould benefit from toxicity identification evalua- \ntions to identify the causative agents responsible \nfor the observed biological effects (Ankley, \n1989). A number of large field surveys are under \nway and being planned by NOAA and will lead to \nadditional data to be included in the database. \nOnce these additional data are available, they \ncould be entered into the database and used to \ndevelop updated or new guidelines. \n14.5 REFERENCES \nAdams, W.J., R.
