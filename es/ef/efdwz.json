Looking back to the process of produ cing this dissertation once I have \ncompleted the final product makes me recall all the people who contributed both intellectually \nand materially. Knowledge production is exceptionally the outcome of one single mind and for \nthe most part could not be comple ted without having the needs of our material life fulfilled. \nThroughout my graduate life and as a graduate student at UCSF in particular, I was fortunate to \nreceive the mentorship, advice, and support of professors, friends, and family, both in the United \nStates and Mexico.  \nDorothy Porter accepted to supervise a thesis that I originally conceived about the history \nof alternative medicine in Mexico but that thanks to her suggestions and ideas turned out to be \nabout the role of the state in the regulation of  the medical profession. Gabriela Soto -Laveaga \nkindly accepted to co -chair my dissertation in spite of residing in a UC different campus. Her \nadvice led me to use other Latin American countries to contrast the Mexican case and her sharp \ninsight clarified a nd improved my ideas about the role of medicine and public health in Mexico \nin many ways. I started my training as a historian of medicine with Elizabeth Watkins and Brian \nDolan. I learned from Elizabeth that the definition of medicine results not only fro m the doctor -\npatient interaction but also from other actors in society at large. From Brian, I learned the \nopposite; that keeping the central role of the doctor -patient relationship in mind is central to \nunderstand the role of broader social actors in medi cine and health. Both Elizabeth\u2019s and Brian\u2019s \nediting skills contributed deeply to improve my English writing in the final manuscript. However \nas customary, the ideas contained in the final manuscript are my full responsibility.  v \n In the process of research  and writing, I enjoyed the benefit of crossing paths with several \nscholars and students who also influenced my work. I want to thank Heather Dron, Kevin Moss, \nErika Langer, and Stephen Beitler, for reading and commenting several drafts of my dissertation \nin the History of Medicine Writing Club during 2013 -14. I want to thank the Program of the \nHistory of Health Sciences at UCSF for providing the opportunity to share preliminary research \nand receive feedback during the Biennial History Day in 2009 and 2011.  Gabriela\u2019s invitation to \nparticipate in the Workshop on the History of Public Health in Latin America and the Caribbean \nheld at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2011 and 2012 gave me the opportunity to \nmeet other scholars and students engagi ng in topics similar to my own. I want to thank Nicole \nPacino in particular. She has been a role model to me, both as an advanced graduate student and \nlater as a young professor. Hanni Halil and \u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez participated in both workshops and \nprovided i nsightful comments to first drafts of some of the chapters. My former graduate \nmentors in Mexico opened spaces both material and academic to do research and discuss my \nwork. Fabricio Gonz\u00e1lez Soriano invited me to a seminar on the historiography of alterna tive \nmedicine in Mexico held at Universidad del Papaloapan , campus Tuxtepec , in 2010 and Laura \nCh\u00e1zaro granted me a research assistantship at CINVESTAV , sede sur , in 2011. Carlos L\u00f3pez \nBeltr\u00e1n ceded one of his classes to discuss my dissertation project with his students at UNAM in \n2011. Ana Mar\u00eda Carrillo and Paul Hersch Mart\u00ednez kindly accepted to discuss my ideas for a \ndoctoral dissertation during the summer of 2011. Homeopaths Fernando Dom\u00ednguez Vello, \nFernando Francois Flores, Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez, and Pedro Fernando Infante Le onides introduced me to the \nworld of homeopathy and its institutions in Mexico.  \nPursuing doctoral studies abroad and about my own country posed si gnificant material \nchallenges to me and my family. We couldn\u2019t have sorted them out without the help of many vi \n friends in both sides of the border. I want to thank Susana and Armando, Matthew and Carmen, \nMalu and Francisco, Ana and Alejandro, Alejandra and A aron, Ros\u00e1ngela and Rafael, Amanda \nand Evan, Erica and Selena, Laura and Jos\u00e9, and Juan Carlos and Ana, who one way or another \nsupported us in good and harsh times and made us feel the Bay Area like home. The long and \nstormy summers in Mexico City felt now  alien to us, but family offered a place to stay \ncomfortably dry and emotionally sheltered. Special thanks go to my grandmother, Do\u00f1a  Luz, t\u00eda \nLuvy, and t\u00edo Juan, who gave us plenty of room to stay and food to eat during the summers of \n2010, 2011, 2012 and  2013. Norma and Tey always opened their homes and kitchens for us.  \nI could not have finished the doctorate and the doctoral dissertation without the emotional \nsupport from my family. My father and mother were always there to listen to me when I went \nthrough difficult times. My father always had words of support that encouraged me to continue. \nWith their ability to distinguish and show different perspectives in life, my mother calmed my \nanxieties. Most of all, I want to thank my partner in life, friend, an d wife, Liliana. She did all the \nactual hard work at home, kept me well fed, nourished my dreams, shared my frustrations, gave \nme joy in times of distress, and persistently showed to me that there is a life beyond academia.  \nSeveral institutions provided t he financial support to pursue my doctoral studies and carry \nout archival research in Mexico. I want to thank the Mexican government and the University of \nCalifornia which through their coordinated CONACYT -UCMEXUS fellowship funded my \ndoctoral studies. Sev eral programs provided the funds for my monthly stipend: the CONACYT -\nUCMEXUS fellowship, UCSF\u2019s Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine, and \nUCSF\u2019s Biomedical Workforce Fellowship. I received support from the UCSF Travel Grant, the \nUC Gradu ate Student Research Award, and the UCMEXUS Small Grant for UC Students to \ncarry out archival research.  vii \n Abstract  \nIn my doctoral dissertation, I analyze homeopathy as a subaltern medical movement that both \nparticipated in and reacted to the cultural reforms and institutional regulations that characterized \nMexico during the Porfiriato and the post -revolutionary period s. In a context where medical \nelites used science to consolidate their position amidst state institutions, homeopaths evolved \ninto a grou p of professional physicians and lay practitioners who held an unorthodox view of \nmedical science and whose institutions diverted the state\u2019s political and economic support. My \nanalysis shows that professional societies, medical schools, and public health offices worked as \nan interconnected structure of regulatory centers. Here, homeopaths, regular medical \npractitioners, and state authorities used their understandings of science, education, and class to \nadvance their position s in the professional arena, org anize and administer medical institutions, \nand centralize political control. I argue that by using homeopathy as a scientific therapeutic \nmethod distinct from contemporary medical science and as a professional ideology that critiqued \nelitist medical traini ng and practice , homeopaths aligned with the Mexican state \u2019s cultural and \ninstitutional reforms  that aimed to provide scientific medical training to the working class. In this \nway, they resisted the marginalizing strategies implemented by medical elites\u2019 p rofessional \nsocieties , professional education , and public health authorities. The professionalization of \nhomeopathy, hence, reproduced in a smaller scale the tensions between lay and scientific \nknowledge, professional libertarianism and regulation, and the  working and the privileged \nclass es that characterized Mexico before and after the revolution of 1910.  My dissertation  thus \ninvestigates the influence of local social, cultural, and political realities in the construction of the \nboundaries between biomedic ine and other healing traditions in modern Mexico.  My work is \nbased on extensive research in private and public archives of homeopathic medical schools, and \ngovernment offices such as the Department of Public Health, the National University, the viii \n General Ar chives of the Nation, and the Historical Archives of Mexico City, as well as published \nhomeopathic journals. This dissertation contributes to the history of medicine and public health \nin Mexico and in Latin America, the history of the medical profession, t he history of alternative \nmedicine, and the history of the Mexican revolution.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  ix \n Table of contents  \n \nAcknowledgements  iv \nAbstract  vii \nIntroduction: What is Revolutionary in the History of Mexican Homeopathy?  1 \nRevolutionary Medicine  6 \nHistoriographical relevance  13 \nChapter Structure  19 \nChapter 1: Med icine \u201cfor the Mexican People\u201d: Liberal Medicine, the Medical \nMarketplace, and Domestic Homeopathy in Mexico, 1853 \u20131901  25 \nRam\u00f3n Co mellas and the Promotion of Homeopathy as a Liberal Form of Medicine  26 \nHomeopathy as a Medical Commodity: Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, Domestic  Medicine and the \nMexican Medical Marketplace  35 \nFrancisco I.

See main text for explanation . 2 \n On October 1935, the journal of Mexico City\u2019s Union of Medical Doctors, Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica , \npublished a special issue aimed to attack what they called \u201cthe charlatanistic homeopathic \nmanifestations\u201d. The back cover  depicted a congress of homeopaths  using symbols and \nrepresentations that pictured homeopathy as a \u201cfanatic and prejudiced\u201d approach to medicine that \nopposed modern scientific progress  (Figure 1) . The owl of wisdo m mocked at the law that had \ncreated a state -funded school of homeopathy in 1895 . A poster above the speaker ridiculed \nhomeopathic medicines by highlighting that the homeopathic pharmaceutical company, \u201cSugar, \nInc.\u201d, promised to heal diseases, such as \u201csca bies, dysentery, syphilis, malaria, and tape worm\u201d . \nThe irony in this comment lay in physicians\u2019 generalized acknowledgment that these diseases \nwere caused by microorganisms  and that they could be only either prevented through sanitary \ninterventions or vac cination or treated with recently developed pharmaceutical products that \nactually proved effective such as Salvarsan for syphilis, but not with homeopathic sugar \nglobules, which contrary to what homeopaths argued other physicians believed did not contain \nany trace of therapeutic substance . The homeopath\u2019s speech in the back cover\u2019s picture repeated \nthe union\u2019s criti ques to homeopathic practice, \u201cthere are no microbes. We stop epidemic \noutbreaks. Serums do not work. Vaccines do harm\u201d. The text -box in the bot tom explained that by \nselling remedies that contained only sugar and water, homeopaths highly profited from their \npractice, concluding in a satirical tone that homeopaths still argued that they helped the poor.1  \nIn this representation of homeopathy, the c onflicting notions of disease and therapeutic \nintervention between homeopaths and allopaths were intertwined with university physicians\u2019 \nideas of what should be science\u2019s and the state\u2019s role in medical training and the provision of \nmedical services. Accor ding to the reasoning of the graduates from the National School of \n                                                             \n1 \"N\u00famero especial dedicado a las manifestaciones charlatanesco -homeop\u00e1ticas,\" Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica .14 \n(1935).  3 \n Medicine, the state should use medical science to train physicians who based on reliable methods \nthat uncovered the true nature of disease would be able to bring health to all the Mexican \npopulation. The tensions between homeopaths and university trained physicians were not new. \nSince the arrival of the first Spanish homeopathic practitioners to Mexican shores in the mid -19th \ncentury, medical elites used contemporary medical science to discr edit homeopathy, \nhomeopaths\u2019 medical practice, and professional organization, in academically -trained \nphysicians\u2019 quest to monopolize state support and the medical marketplace. As during the \nPorfiriato (the thirty -year-long period when Porfirio Diaz ruled the country, 1884 \u20131911), science \nwas used as a tool not only to modernize state institutions but to redeem the masses after the \narmed conflicts of the 1910s. For instance, in a talk given to the Nationa l Academy of Sciences \n\u201cAntonio Alzate\u201d in 1937, Alfonso Pruneda, an elite physician who occupied key government \npositions from which he promoted the reconstruction of institutions of the revolutionary state in \nthe 1920s, the social function of science , which according to him consisted in allow ing the \nhumanity to live an easy and pleasant life , could not be entirely achieved if the rupture between \nscience and the  masses was not mended and if university students and faculty did not get closer \nto the people.2 In other words, for Pruneda, Mexico could not achieve the desired progress unless \nscience became part of Mexican culture, that is, until all of Mexican society integrated science as \nan integral part of its ways of understanding the natural and the social w orld.  \nHowever, this redeeming view of science, progressive as it may seem, carried the seeds \nof exclusionary social, cultural, and political mobilizations, such as the one depicted in the \nintroductory vignette. Being a physician, Alfonso Pruneda himself u sed science to discredit other \nforms of healing approaches. In a conference given to the Sociedad Folkl\u00f3rica de M\u00e9xico \n                                                             \n2 Alfonso Pruneda, \"La funci\u00f3n social de la ciencia,\" Memorias de la Academia Nacional de Ciencias \n\"Antonio Alzate\"  54.1-3 (1937): 56 -9. 4 \n [Folkloric Society of Mexico] in 1942, Pruneda explained the nature of charlatanism and detailed \nthe practices of charlatans in Mexico.3 According to him, a charlatan was someone who abused \nothers because that person knew that it was possible to take advantage of their ignorance and \nna\u00efvet\u00e9. He did not mentioned homeopaths among Mexican charlatans, but his description \nmirrored those given b y the Mexico City\u2019s Union of Medical Doctors  in the special issue \ndedicated to homeopathy.  This was no coincidence. Medical students were being trained in \ncontemporary science in the National School of Medicine at the National University of Mexico \nduring t he 1920s. With promoters of science such as Fernando Ocaranza who led the former, and \nAlfonso Pruneda who led the latter, the medical school reproduced Pruneda\u2019s critiques of other \napproaches to medicine that differed from those supported by contemporary m edical science. For \ninstance, Miguel Cece\u00f1a Quiroz, who studied medicine at the National School in the mid -1920s \nand later practiced homeopathy, said that  \nif one professor talked about [homeopathy] \u2014 may be because it became a \nfashion when we [students wh o were formerly studying homeopathy at the state \n\u2014 sponsored homeopathic medical school that was merged to the National \nSchool of Medicine in 1924] came - it was to attribute to [homeopathy] any \nwisecrack [ cuchufleta ] that revealed [the professor\u2019s] lack of  knowledge about the \nissue. [\u2026] One of the professors, full of pride and vanity, said \u2018homeopaths put in \na container a large number of white and inert globules, as they say, and then it is \nenough for them to lean out into the container and scream \u2014 for ins tance \u2014 \nArgentum nitricum in the 30th dilution, with which the globules are baptized\u2019.4  \n \nIt is no surprise that most physicians who studied at the National University contended that \nhomeopathy and similar practices were useless, regardless of their wide a cceptance by the \npublic.  \nThis public was frequently described as the people or the masses, as in Pruneda\u2019s works. \nHowever, homeopaths proselytized that their approach was beneficial to a specific group of \n                                                             \n3 Alfonso Pruneda, \"La supercher\u00eda m\u00e9dica en el folklore,\" Anuario de la Sociedad Folkl\u00f3rica de M\u00e9xico  \nIII (1942).  \n4 Miguel Cece\u00f1a Quiroz, \"Retorno,\" Revista homeop\u00e1tica  I.1 (1936).  5 \n people, not all the people, and particularly not e lites, as it used to happen during the Porfiriato . \nHomeopathic physicians, homeopathic lay practitioners, patients, and any who defended \nhomeopathy in social terms after 1910 argued that homeopathy was particularly suitable for the \npoor, the disenfranchise d, and the working class. For this reason, Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez de Origel, a \nhomeopathic practitioner in Guadalajara, said that homeopathy was \u201ctruly revolutionary\u201d. By \nprotecting these particular groups of people, she argued, homeopathy \u201cprepared the healthy \nfuture of the Republic; because when healing the Mexican people, it made men suitable to \ncontribute to the glory of the revolution; at the same time, [homeopathy] protected nationalism in \nthe sense that it prevented the high influx of patent medicines coming  from foreign countries at a \nhigh cost for the national treasure [\u2026]\u201d. For this reason, she concluded, \u201cHomeopathic Science \nis truly revolutionary and must not be discharged\u201d, referring to the campaign led by university \nphysicians against homeopaths.5  \nThe progressive science pictured by Pruneda was the same as that which prevented the \nprogress of the nation, in the opinion of homeopathy supporters. The need to bring science to the \nmasses in Pruneda\u2019s talk indicated the limitations of the National Universit y to bring education \nto the Mexican population in general and to popularize scientific knowledge in particular. As \nexemplified in Querido Moheno\u2019s letter to request that graduates from a proprietary homeopathic \nmedical school received licenses to practice medicine from the Department of Public Health, the \nuse of science as a tool of progress, which was reflected in the structural changes carried out by \ngovernment authorities, seemed to contradict the revolutionary values that motivated these \nchanges in the first place. In other words, the revolutionary policies and government structures \nthat used science as the foundational ideology of progress privileged Mexican social elites and \n                                                             \n5 See correspondence from Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez de Origel to the head of the Depart ment of Public Health on \nFebruary 28, 1934, in the AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 76 -8.  6 \n while in principle aimed to bring modernity to the masses, in practice they le ft out of the \nequation of progress those for whom the revolution was fought. Moheno argued that  \nin the Department of Public Health was established a mafia of allopaths, who had \nbeen working against homeopaths due to envy and competition. Since those \nrevol utionaries  who governed boasted their being protagonists of progress \u2014 he \nargued \u2014 the Department of Public Health, being integrated by revolutionaries , \nshould not prevent the practice of homeopathic medicine because this had even \nmore scientific foundations than allopathy.6  \n \nHomeopaths and their supporters contended, hence, that medical science and those who \nsupported it were not revolutionary. This contention begs the question, what was there in \nhomeopathy that made it revolutionary as opposed t o biomedicine in the 1920s and 30s in \nMexico? What does Mexican homeopaths\u2019 activism tell us about the position of medical science \nand the medical profession in Mexico from the last half of the 19th century to the first decades of \nthe 20th century? What do es homeopathy as revolutionary medicine tell us about its relevance as \na historical subject in Mexican history?  \n Revolutionary Medicine   \nMy dissertation uses homeopathy as a lens to understand the changes that the Mexican \nmedical profession went through i n the period from the publication of the first homeopathic \nmanuals in the mid -19th century to the recognition of homeopathic medical doctors as regular \npractitioners in the law of professions issued in 1943. During this century homeopathy not only \ngained a  place among the therapies consumed and administered by urban Mexican patients, but \nalso and perhaps most importantly, obtained the support of the Mexican state as a medical option \nsuitable to the national population. Whether as a \u201cmedical reform\u201d promoted  by elites during the \n19th century or as \u201crevolutionary medicine\u201d pushed by the working class during the 1920s and \n                                                             \n6 Querido Moheno\u2019s request for the revision of the case between the Department of Public Health and \nhomeopaths graduated from the Free School of Homeopathic Medicine, on Apr il 14, 1923, AHSS, SP, \nEM, 4, 15, pp. 64 -66. Emphasis in the original .  7 \n 30s, homeopathic practitioners were able to convince contrastingly different sectors of the \nMexican population as well as officers with radic ally different political ideologies and \ngovernment strategies of the usefulness of their peculiar therapeutic approach to the Mexican \npopulation. As I argue in the first two chapters of this dissertation, homeopathy was a medicine \nof elites during the 19th century. Only literate citizens who had access either to literature that \ncame from Europe or to books, pamphlets and newspapers published by nationals were able to \nread about homeopathy and practice it. Illiterate citizens had access, if any, only through  the \ncharitable homeopathic practice of these literate elites. Consequently, homeopathy\u2019s \ninstitutionalization just before the turn of the 20th century was a result of the mobilization of \nhomeopathic elites in a government that privileged elites. In this s ense, the \u201cmedical reform\u201d was \nless an epistemological overturn to medical knowledge than a political one. Members of the \nnational medical profession acknowledged that homeopathy divided national medical science, \nactually meaning the profession, by receivi ng state support and diverting resources that \notherwise would have been allocated to the regular profession.  \nThe revolution initiated in 1910 transformed Mexican society and initiated a series of \nstructural changes that slowly materialized in state instit utions through the 1920s and 30s. In this \nperiod homeopathic institutions were at the same time eclipsed and reivindicated by government \nofficers. On one side, Porfirian cient\u00edficos such as Pruneda and Ocaranza based their \nexclusionary policies on a monolithic understanding of medical science, leading to the clousure \nof homeopathic medical schools and the marginalization of homeopathic practitioners. On the \nother, educational reformer s such as Jose Vasconcelos (Dean of the National University and \nMinistry of Public Education, 1920 \u20134) and government officers concerned with the provision of \neducation to non elites, i.e., the working class and the urban and rural poor, such as President 8 \n Emilio Portes Gil (1920 \u201330) and L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas (1934 \u20138) restructured state educational \ninstitutions to include homeopathic schools and regulate homeopathic practice. There was no \nshift from \u201cmedical reform\u201d to \u201crevolutionary medicine\u201d, in the sense that th e revolution did not \nchange the ideology of elite homeopaths who were trained at Porfirian homeopathic institutions. \nRather, the revolution set the conditions for the organization of urban non elites around \nhomeopathy as an ideology through which they coul d actively protest against the privileges of \nmedical elites. Homeopathy as a marginal and marginalized urban medical system gave voice to \nthe larger complaints of the working class but in the realm of medicine.  \nRevolution and revolutionary are word s heavi ly loaded with multiple meanings. These \nmeanings are regularly associated with drastic changes that lead to progress. For instance, the \nrevolutions of independence in Latin America in the early 19th century that detached this region \nof the globe from colon ial, mostly Spanish, political, economic, social, and cultural rule, and the \nrevolutions in the 20th century that aimed to overturn the privileges that independent Latin \nAmerican nation states perpetuated in the 19th century are but an example of how this word \nrefers to radical changes in social, political, economic, and cultural structures. Intellectual \nhistories in general and histories of science and medicine in particular have used the word to \nrefer to dramatic changes in the understanding of the natura l world or notions of disease. Perhaps \nthe most iconic example in the history of science is the term Scientific Revolution which refers \nto drastic changes that occurred in the early modern period and initiated a new way of \nunderstanding the natural world.7 While historians of medicine are less prone to talk about \n                                                             \n7 See for instance works such as P. M. Harman, The Scientific Revolution , Lancaster pamphlets (London ; \nNew York: Methuen, 1983). ; I. Bernard Cohen, The Birth of a New Physics , Rev. and updated. ed. (New \nYork: W.W. Norton, 1985). ; Alexandre Koyr\u00e9, From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe , The \nlibrary of religion and culture: History, 1st Harper Torchbook ed.

David C. Lindberg and Robert S. Westman (Cambridge 9 \n radical changes in revolutionary terms, the term has not escaped some major medical \nbreakthroughs particularly those associated with the rise of biomedicine at the end of the 19th \ncentury.8  \nMy use  of the term \u201crevolutionary medicine\u201d does not imply any assumption that \nhomeopathy as a medical system or as a therapeutic commodity represented or represents a \nradical therapeutic innovation or a breakthrough in the understanding of disease and the body,  \nalthough homeopaths used both this term and \u201cthe medical reform\u201d in this sense. Rather, what I \nmean is that the Mexican state\u2019s adoption of homeopathy as one of the forms through which it \nprovides medical training and healing services to the Mexican popul ation raises questions about \nthe place of science in the configuration of the national medical profession and the stratification \nof Mexican society; the role of the state in defining such a configuration with the aim to fulfill \nthe social promises of the r evolution; and the usefulness of categories that divide medicine into \nthe dichotomies of scientific/regular/orthodox/mainstream and \nalternative/irregular/unorthodox/marginalized to study the history of medicine in Mexico. In \nother words, Mexican homeopathy  is revolutionary because it highlights the power of medical \nscience as a tool to reform and modernize the medical profession, including both elite and \nworking class homeopaths; because by reconfiguring the understandings of medical science it \nwas able to obtain, lose, retain, and regain state support in the 19th century and throughout the \n20th century; because it gave voice to a particular group of practitioners whose critiques of \nmedical elites\u2019 policies to regulate medical training and practice opened up  the contradictions of \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nEngland ; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990).  For an analysis that questions  this narrative see \nSteven Shapin, The Scientific Revolution  (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1996).  \n8 As an example see Morris J. Vogel and Charles E. Rosenberg, The Therapeutic Revolution: Essays in \nthe Social History of American Medicine  (Phil adelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1979). ; and \nAndrew Cunningham and Perry Williams, The Laboratory Revolution in Medicine  (Cambridge ; New \nYork, NY: Cambridge University Press, 1992).  10 \n top-down regulatory policies; because using it as an ideology, its practitioners organized a \nprofessional group and created medical schools and clinics that the revolutionary state used to \nnegotiate the growing political power of med ical elites; and finally because it pushes us to \nreconceptualize the historiography of Mexican medicine.  \nAs this list suggests, this dissertation centers its analysis of homeopathy on the \nnegotiations of scientific knowledge in the configuration of the me dical profession and the \ncreation of state institutions, on the educational policies that aimed to homogenize professional \nmedical training through one single medical curriculum, on the use of a unique approach to \nmedical training as the measure to regulat e professional medical practice, and finally on the \nlimits of such regulatory policies. As in the rest of the Western world, science played a key role \nin the consolidation of the Mexican state as well as of the Mexican medical profession through \nthe second  half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. Both Porfirian elites and \ntheir ideological descendants after the revolution used science to implement policies that aimed \nto modernize a society that these cient\u00edficos regarded as backward. Consequently, science as a \nmodernizing ideology that motivated educational reforms after the revolution perpetuated class \ndistinctions established since the Porfiriato . Educational reforms in these two historical periods \naimed to mode rnize the curriculum of medical schools to incorporate recent advances in medical \nscience and to equip them with the instrumentation they needed to implement such curriculum, \nbut medical training was not opened to the masses, as Pruneda\u2019s speech suggests. However if \nMexican officials used science to direct the construction of government institutions, Mexican \nliberalism emphasized that knowledge was not the privilege of some and that any literate citizen \nwas free to acquire, profess, and practice the knowled ge \u2014 or ciencia  as it was usually referred \nby liberals \u2014 he or she wanted. Being a European therapeutic commodity practiced by elites, 11 \n homeopathy penetrated the minds of some professional physicians as a new scientific \nbreakthrough, but most importantly of  some non -professional literate citizens who set it to work \nfor the benefit of others both as a private effort to relieve the latter of disease in the absence of \nphysicians or as a lucrative business that sold homeopathy as a proprietary remedy. Economic \nliberalism, which favored individual enterprise and free market, conflicted with professional \nmonopoly. In this scenario, medical elites used their own understanding of medical science to \ndiscredit homeopathy as a type of knowledge that fooled na\u00efve people,  as a knowledge that was \npopular but not scientific. This distinction between specialized or scientific and popular medical \nknowledge permeated discussions between homeopaths and medical elites and dictated, once the \nlatter were installed in regulatory pos itions in the new revolutionary state, the policies to \nmarginalize homeopaths.  \nSecond, since science played a key role in the modernization of Mexico and the \nconsolidation of the Mexican medical profession, medical elites in key government positions \nincor porated this key ideology in educational institutions regulated by the state. Government \nofficials hoped to transform Mexican society by indoctrinating them in positivistic science. \nHowever, only urban elites who lived in Mexico City benefited from this pr oject. They learned \nAuguste Comte\u2019s epistemological approach to understand the natural and the social world in the \nNational Preparatory School after which they embarked on a professional career. The projects for \neducational reform during the Porfiriato , which included homeopathy,  were halted by the armed \nconflicts of the revolution, but once an established form of government was achieved in 1917, \nthe Porfirian elites that were implementing such reforms resumed the project to modernize \nMexico through educati on. However, the new position of medical elites within the government \nadministration, the poor economic situation of the revolutionary government, and the need to 12 \n maximize economic resources in an increasingly more expensive medical school led the state to  \nstop supporting homeopathy. In this context, only private homeopathic medical schools sustained \nby working class students helped homeopathy thrive as an option of medical training for those \ncitizens who could neither afford nor attend the classes in the s tate medical school. Yet the \nregulatory efforts of the revolutionary state followed the same trends of the Porfiriato  and \neventually regulated these schools by requiring them to comply with a specific medical \ncurriculum.  \nThird, this dissertation analyzes t he control of medical practice as a sanitary strategy. \nMedical elites took control of the new Department of Public Health and regarding the free \npractice of medicine as a plague that needed to be combated accordingly used the resources of \nthe sanitary offi ce to ban the practice of those who had not studied in authorized medical \nschools. I contend that through controlling the National University, the National School of \nMedicine, and the Department of Public Health, medical elites mounted a campaign to \nmargin alize the practice of their main competitor, homeopaths. The analysis of changes in the \nmedical curriculum of homeopathic schools as well as the sanitary campaigns to ban the practice \nof these schools\u2019 graduates show that medical elites\u2019 purpose to moderni ze the medical \nprofession through science contradicted the need to provide medical training to the working \nclass. Medical elites\u2019 policies were designed to keep the privilege of becoming professional \nphysicians to a few who usually belonged to economic and  social elites and to ban the possibility \nof professional medical training and the social mobility that these implied to the working class. \nIn this sense, I argue that the modernizing efforts of the medical elites clashed with the state\u2019s \neffort to dissolv e the acute social stratification inherited from the Porfiriato . 13 \n Finally, facing the unwillingness of the regular medical profession to respond to the \nstate\u2019s social projects, revolutionary governments gave their support back to homeopathy in the \nlate 1920 s and during the 1930s. This support overturned the policies implemented by medical \nelites, for homeopathic medical schools, both private and public, became regular institutions and \nits graduates regular practitioners. However, neither medical elites\u2019 nor the state\u2019s policies \ncompletely banned or allowed the practice of homeopaths, respectively. The lack of a clear \nregulatory framework of professional practice at the federal level and in each local state before \n1943 allowed homeopaths who lacked either a de gree or a license to practice in the nation. \nMoreover, regulatory inconsistency in the rapidly changing legal framework during the 1920s \nand 30s allowed different homeopathic medical schools to exist regardless of the state\u2019s effort to \ncentralize and simpl ify professional education in the second half of the 1930s. I maintain that the \nconflicting negotiations between different understandings of science, their implementation as \neducational policies that resulted either in the perpetuation of class distinction  or in an effort to \ndisrupt these distinctions, and the contradictory regulatory policies of the state resulted in a \nmedical landscape where a plurality of services prevailed and where homeopathy was vindicated \nas medicine for the working class, \u201crevolutio nary medicine\u201d.  \nHistoriographical relevance  \nThis dissertation emerges at the intersection of three fields of historical inquiry, the \nhistory of alternative medicine, the history of public health, and the history of the Mexican \nrevolution. Mexican homeopathy, as conspicuous in the national medical ma rketplace during the \nprevious two centuries as this introduction might suggest, has not been incorporated into national \nhistories of medicine or anthropological studies of medicine in the region until the last couple of \ndecades. Besides anthropologists and  historians, homeopaths have chronicl ed their own historical 14 \n trajectories .9 The work of anthropologists shows that the widespread presence of homeopathy \npersists to the present and that its practitioners have a diverse academic and economic \nbackground: hea ds of family, other professionals who find in homeopathy an extra income, \npharmacy owners or employees, allopathically trained doctors and even specialists who study \nhomeopathy as another specialty in their quest to broaden their professional horizons.10 \nHistorians have centered their attention in homeopaths\u2019 oppositional and combative role against \nmainstream elite physicians during the 19th century in Mexico City. While acknowledging the \ndiversity of ideological positions amongst homeopaths regarding the nature of homeopathy and \nits oppositions to the principles of medical science, or what homeopaths called allopathy, Ana \nMar\u00eda Carrillo depicts them as a group that disqualified mainstream medicine and combated \nagainst the practices that derived from it.11 My analysis extends the understanding of Mexican \nhomeopathy during the 19th century by acknowledging its role as domestic medicine and a \npharmaceutical commodity in the Mexican medical marketplace of this period. The key role that \n                                                             \n9 These chronicles are very useful to the historian because th ey illuminate possible routes to follow in the \nprocess of research.

By \nextending my ana lysis to the first half of the 20th century, my dissertation places homeopaths as \nkey actors in the development of medical institutions and sanitary regulations during the 1920s \nand 30s.  \nHistorians of the medical profession in Mexico have emphasized the i mportance of \nirregular healers, homeopaths among them, in the provision of health services to the population \nand as competitors of mainstream medicine during the colonial period and the 19th century, but \nnone of them have used the term alternative to descr ibe such practices.12 In contrast, Historians \nwho describe the medical profession of Costa Rica and Colombia during the 19th and 20th \ncenturies picture a landscape where medical pluralism is the norm.13 Historians of medicine in \nthe U. S. consider medical pr actices such as hydropathy, homeopathy, osteopathy, and Christian \nScience, alternative, as a consequence of the hegemonic control that the mainstream medical \nprofession achieved over these competitors during the first half of the 20th century.14 However, \n                                                             \n12 See Luz Maria Hern\u00e1ndez Saenz, Learning to Heal.

The historiography of homeopathy assumes that this \nparticular group of practitioners whether professional or lay were regulated by efforts within the \nmedical profession to monopolize medical training and the provisio n of health services in the \nabsence of any external regulator, such as the state. For this reason some political scientists and \nsociologists have regarded the professionalization of American physicians as an exemplary case \nof how liberal professions organi ze.17 The presence of the state as regulator of professional \norganizations and as arbiter of professional disputes changes significatively the structure of the \nmedical profession. For instance, social scientists Gustavo Nigenda and Sol\u00f3rzano argue that the \ncorporativistic politics of the Mexican state in the 20th century resulted in a dispersed, and I \nwould say plural, medical profession.18 Along the same line of reasoning, public health academic \nand former Minister of Public Health (2000 \u20136) Julio Frenk argues that the interventionist state \nregulated the profession through training and the provision of labor.19 By responding to the \ndemands of  different medical groups as an approach to maintain its political control, the Mexican \nstate fragmented the medical profession and did not allow the concentration of power in a single \nprivileged group. My dissertation historicizes this process by centerin g its attention in the most \nconspicuous competitor of the medical profession, homeopaths. Through this lens, it shows up \nthat state intervention was not monolithic.

These histories have described epidemic disease as the motivation to implement sanitary \nmeasures led by mainstream physicians and public health officers that imposed social, cultural, \nand economic values associated with modernity to populations usually regarded as racially \ninferior, filthy, and ignorant by public health authorities.20 My dissertation contributes to this \n                                                             \n20 There are a wide number of examples of this approach.

By regarding the liberal practice of \nmedicine as a plague that needed to be combated, sanitary authorities embarked on a campaign to \nsanitize the profession and get rid of practitioner s who lacked adequate medical training. As \nother works on the role of public health in containing disease show, my work evidences the \ncontradictions of these sanitary campaigns and unmasks the real problem behind the regulation \nof medical practice: the lac k of physicians who tended to the health needs of the Mexican \npopulation and the lack of access among the working class to professional medical training. \nAnalysis of the civilizing and modernizing efforts of the campaigns to sanitize the medical \nprofession  reveals the anxieties of Mexican physicians to retain control of their profession.  \nChapter Structure  \nMy dissertation traces the development of homeopathy from a domestic therapeutic \ncommodity in the mid -19th century into a regulated profession at the end  of the 1930s. It is \ndivided in six chapters. Chapter 1 analyzes the popularization of homeopathy as domestic \nmedicine and as a therapeutic commodity by entrepreneurial pharmacists and physicians in the \ncontext of 19th-century Mexican liberalism. It also e xplores how literate elites used homeopathy \nto their own domestic purposes through the case study of Francisco I. Madero. This chapter aims \nto understand how  homeopathy was unconventional in the context of Mexican medicine during \nthe 19th century and how M exican people appropriated , promoted , and used the new therapeutic \napproach . Homeopathy arrived in Mexico when physicians were incorporating French positivism \ninto the national educational system and the French clinical methodology into medical schools. \nThe search for the anatomical cause of disease competed with homeopathy\u2019s symptomatic \napproach, but in the context of political liberalism which emphasized individual rights, a 20 \n symptomatic approach was closer to the personal experience of individuals who did  not have \ntechnical training in medicine.  Therefore the chapter contends that homeopathy was popularized \nin Mexican society because it fit the liberal ethos of the time, turning itself into the \u201cmedicine for \nthe people\u201d.  \nChapter 2 problematizes domestic h omeopathy by analyzing the adoption of homeopathy \nby university trained physicians and their efforts to turn it into a mainstream medical practice in \nthe last quarter during the Porfiriato . During this period, the homeopathic community divided \ninto two gro ups. Homeopathic elitist physicians supported the monopolizing efforts of the \nregular profession, while other homeopathic practitioners including lay and professionally \ntrained homeopaths endorsed a liberal approach to medical training and practice. In thi s chapter, \nI explain the efforts of homeopathic physicians to introduce  this therapeutic approach into the \ndynamics of medical professionalization in Mexico City. Such introduction meant that in order to \ncope with medical regulations and professional unifying tendencies, homeopathic physicians had \nto acknowledge the authority of the National School of Medicine and the Superior Board of \nHealth in matters of medical training and licensing. Furthermore, these physicians adopted the \nrhetoric of positivistic science to position homeopathy as a scientific therapy over other \ntherapies. Consequently , homeopathi c physicians regarded entrepreneurial approaches to and the \nliberal practice of homeopathy described in Chapter 1 as unprofessional, and separated their \nactivities and institutions from homeopathic practitioners who endorsed them. Eventually, the \ndivision of the homeopathic community paid off in terms of professional recognition. A \ngovernment that sought to modernize the nation through education and science such as that of \nPorfirio D\u00edaz saw the opportunity to train a growing population of irregular homeopat hic \npractitioners with dubious medical training and professional credentials in modern scientific 21 \n homeopathic therapeutics , using properly trained homeopathic physicians in a homeopathic \nhospital and a school funded by the federal state. A \u201cmedical reform\u201d  turned the \u201cmedicine for \nthe people\u201d into a medical profession  at the end of the 19th century . \nChapter 3 explores the role of the state\u2019s educational politics and homeopaths\u2019 political \nactivism after the revolution in  the development of both private and p ublic homeopathic medical \nschools.  The way different homeopathic groups used the rhetoric of educating the working class \nintertwined with the state \u2019s educational and administrative policies and the interests of the larger \nmedical and the local homeopathic community.  Addressing medical training and healing services \nfor the working class granted homeopaths support from both the people and the state throughout \nthe 20th century, in spite of National -School -of-Medicine (ENM) graduates\u2019 general opposition. \nIn ins titutional terms, this rhetoric helped them to receive Porfirio D\u00edaz\u2019s support to open a \nNational Homeopathic Hospital (HNH) and the National School of Homeopathic Medicine \n(ENMH ) in 1893 and 1895 , respectively ; it helped the Escuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda de  M\u00e9xico  \n[Free School of Homeopathy of Mexico, ELHM] to  attract students and become the largest \nhomeopathic medical school in Mexico in the 1920s and 30s; and it also helped to reinstall the \nENMH as a state medical school during the C\u00e1rdenas administration after the National \nUniversity disintegrated it in 1925. The homeopathic medical system and professional schools \nthrived in the first half of the 20th century due to homeopaths\u2019 ability to align their training \ninstitutions with different governments\u2019 populi st policies that aimed to bring professional \neducation to the working class . However, this alignment came at a cost for homeopathic medical \nschools needed to adopt the scientific medical curriculum imposed by the ENM.  \nIn chapter  4, I pay attention to the negotiations between authorities of the D epartment of \nPublic Health (DSP) and first the National University of Mexico ( UNM ), and later the Ministry 22 \n of Public Education [ Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica , SEP] to achieve a coherent regulation to \ncontrol medic al practice. Particularly, I emphasize the central role that sanitary authorit ies played \nin this process. The UNM did not want to assume the role of a state institution that pr escribed \nprofessional training, particularly at free schools, and in the late 19 20s lost its place as a state \ninstitution that could potentially regulate professional training, at least locally in Mexico City. \nFacing such lack of first willingness and later authority, the DSP promoted reforms and \nenforcement of the Sanitary Code, aimi ng to cope with practitioners who lacked irregular \nmedical degrees. I argue that the drive to control medical practice came from the DSP\u2019s new \nposition in the government structure initiated in 1917, where it had the authority to rule on health \nmatters all over the nation. I also argue that sanitary authorities aimed to sanitize the profession \nat the national level assuming that the demograph ics of professional physicians in the \ncountryside reflected th ose of Mexico City.  \nChapter 5 analyzes the forms of res istance of homeopaths since their arrival in Mexico in \nthe mid -19th century to the year 1930, when President Emilio Portes Gil (1928 \u201330) issued a \ndecree that made the ELHM a legal institution. The purpose is to show that homeopaths\u2019 \nresistance provides a w ay to measure the limits of professional regulation. Homeopaths \u2019 nature \nas both regular and irregular practitioners and their struggles to belong to the medical profession \nand be acknowledged as such shows that the dispute between homeopaths and al lopaths was a \npolitical rather than an epistemological one. Consequently, resistance, marginalization, \nprofessional control, and regulation were deeply influenced by the specific state policies in each \nhistorical period, the state structures that implement ed such policies, and the particular position \nof these two professional medical groups within these state structures. This chapter, hence, 23 \n shows how homeopathy evolved as a subaltern social movement that resisted the hegemonic \nprocess of professionalization from t he mid -19th century to the 1920s.  \nIn the final chapter, I analyze the failed efforts of graduates from other free schools to \nresist the marginalization of medical practice by the sanitary code of 1926. I argue in the first \nsection that the DSP enforced its  sanitary polic y and turned into a regulator of professional \nmedical training as a result of the ELHM\u2019s political ability to obtain its recognition as an official \nmedical school. The shifting policies of the Maximato (1928 \u201334) together with the conflicts \nbetween the state and the university resulted in new regulations that the SEP used to shy away \nfrom its responsibility to regulate free schools and the DSP used to ban free school graduates \nfrom the medical registry. In the absence of an agreement between t he SEP and the DSP \nregarding adequate medical  training, the latter became an  office that specifically surveyed free \nschools to pr ove they lacked official credentials to grant medical degrees. In the second section, I \nexplore how the DSP changed its approac h to police medical advertising from trying to convince \npractitioners of their compliance with the sanitary code to generating legal procedures that \nhelped sanitary authorities frame legal cases that ensured practitioners b oth pa id fines and \ncomplied with the sanitary code. Finally, I analyze the arguments that homeopaths used to \nunfruitfully convince President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez (1932 \u201334) and sanitary authorities to \nincorporate their demands in a new version o f the sanitary code in 1934. The se letters \nhighlighted the conflict between sanitary authorities , ENM graduates , and homeopaths in terms \nof class struggle, professional competition, and the suitability of homeopathy as a scientific \nmedicine for the working class. They used a social democra tic rhetoric to convince the \nrevolutionary government that supporting homeopathy aligned with the  purposes and aims of the \nrevol ution. I conclude with a reflection about the limits of both top -down approaches to 24 \n regulation of the medical profession through  sanitary campaigns and bottom up social \nmobilizations that aimed to limit or modify state intervention.  \n 25 \n Chapter 1: Medicine \u201cfor the Mexican People\u201d: Liberal Medicine, the Medical \nMarketplace, and Domestic Homeopathy in Mexico, 185 3\u20131901  \nOn 17 August 1901, Anastasia  Rodr\u00edguez , a 55 -year-old woman sought Francisco I. \nMadero\u2019s medical advice to cope with maladies that had started disturbing her three months \nbefore . Madero found out that she was sick with \u201crheumatism and attacks; crippled\u2026 and before \nthat, she had burnt her arm.\u201d  Confidently, he prescribed \u201cRhus \u201d, an acronym for Rhus \ntoxicodendron , a homeopathic remedy that according to Juli\u00e1n Gonzalez\u2019s Family Guide , was \nuseful to treat \u201cimminent apoplexy \u201d and head-related complai nts; rheumatism, particularly \n\u201cmuscular and joint \u2026 numbness\u2026,  and limb rigidity and paralytic  resistance\u201d ; and some forms \nof fevers related to typhus .1 Three days later, attacks receded, but the rest of Anastasia\u2019s \ncomplaints persisted. During that month, her mobility and burns  improved, yet attacks resumed \nover and over again. Madero persisted in his prescription, though one month later he decided to \nprescribe \u201cmagnetized water \u201d. This remedy worked as an emetic at first, and consequently he \nenhanced such e ffect by prescribing Arnica . Since then every time Anastasia reported that \nattacks resumed, Madero prescribed this type of water, until she \u201cnotified [him] that precisely \n[on 6 November ] when she starte d drinking the magnetized water , attacks receded.\u201d 2 \nDuring the second half of the nineteenth  century, homeopathy was one of the most \nwidely adopted and discussed medical systems amongst physicians in Europe and North \nAmerica. In Mexico, its detractors argued that such a system broadly departed from \n                                                             \n1 Madero likely used  Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s  Family Guide  as a tool to prescribe homeopathic remedies to his \npatients; though he had access to other homeopathic treatises produced abroad, particularly France.

Madero. \nThey consumed it as a modern medical commodity that put medical science in the everyday \nlanguage of non -technically trained people. In turn these literate individuals used homeopathy to \nprovide healing services to illiterate people who could not read a homeopathic manual and take \ntheir health in their own hands , or who  could not afford to pa y for the travel and services of \neducated physicians. In order to diffuse homeopathy in Mexico, early practitioners and \npromoters wrapped this medical system in a set of liberal values and practices that prompted its \nconsumpt ion amongst literate elites, first as patients and later as practitioners.  \nRam\u00f3n Comellas and the Promotion of Homeopathy as a Liberal Form of Medicine  \nOn August 1853, Ram\u00f3n Comellas, a recently arrived Spanish physician, announced the \npublication of his book Rese\u00f1a de la homeopat\u00eda dedicada a los mexicanos  [Outline of \nHomeopathy Dedicated to the Mexican People] . The timing of homeopathy\u2019s introduction to \nMexico could not have been better politically and historically situated in terms of its eventual \nsucce ss as a therapeutic approach that organized its practitioners into a profession. The new \nnation was reconstructing itself under the banners of republicanism and liberalism after earning \n                                                             \n3 Manuel Eulogio Carpio commented on homeopathy in Fernando Mart\u00ednez Cort\u00e9s, La medicina cient\u00edfica \ny el siglo XIX mexicano , ed.

A new \u201cmedical \ndoctrine that was cultivated and cared for in the majority of the civilized world\u201d , as Comellas \nadvertised homeopathy, fit the needs of a coun try that was striving for reconstruction and \nmodernization .5  \nResponding to the need to create structures that favored personal freedom and individual \nlegal uniformity, Mexico and its medical institutions went through a radical transformation in the \nmid-nineteenth  century .6 As in other Latin American countries, Mexican physicians belonged to \nsocial elites who had access not only to academic training based on Latin and Greek texts, but \nalso to modern philosophies that were flourishing in France and elsewhere  in Europe .7 Due to \ntheir privileged position, they were key agents in the institutional transformation of medicine. \nFor instance, they banned birth rights as requirement to enroll in medical schools, and any \nchurch influence on the structure of the medical curriculum .8 But while these structural changes \n                                                             \n5 The newspaper ad is in \"Rese\u00f1a de la homeopat\u00eda  dedicada \u00e1 los mexicanos,\" El siglo diez y nueve  \nLunes 22 de agosto 1853.

They had a deep influence in the achievement of independence.

Following French medicine, Hippocratic and Galenic humoralism was ceding to new \nnotions of the healthy and diseased body based on the connection between clinical observations \nat the bedside and autopsies of dead b odies . Such empirical connection, t he basis of pathologic \nanatomy , integrated surgical and medical knowledge into one single epistemological apparatus. \nPathologic anatomy gave nineteenth -century physicians a privileged access to the body and a \nspecialized understanding of disease that the common people did not have. Elite physicians used \nsuch privileged epistemological access to create distance from popular approaches to disease and \nhealth. Their political liberalism led them to modernize medical institutio ns, but relying on \nmodern medical knowledge to privilege their professional status led them to perpetuate the \nformer stratification and marginalization of medical practices and knowledges.  \nComellas\u2019 rhetoric to popularize homeopathy capitalize d on the fac t that medical \nknowledge was a privilege of those who received proper training. In order to replicate the status \nof medical knowledge for homeopathy, Comellas appropriated strategies elite physicians used to \ntrain medical students at professional schools. For instance, he mimicked Manuel Carpio\u2019s \nattempts to make medical knowledge and breakthroughs available to Spanish -speaking medical \nstudents at the recently formed School of Medical Sciences .9 Though originally conceived by the \n                                                             \n9 Manuel Carpio studied at the Seminary in Puebla where besides learning the scholastic curriculum he \nlearned medicine. During his school years he translated the Aphoris ms of Hippocrates and published them \naltogether with a translation of Laennec\u2019s article about the use of the stethoscope in 1823. After his \ngraduation he promoted the departure from scholasticism and Hippocratic medicine in the sake of French \nmedical scien ce. Manuel Carpio was one the founders of the School of Medical Sciences where he \nintroduced the experimental study of drugs through the works of Francois Magendie.

R\u00e9gimen homeop\u00e1tico e instruccion \npara consultar con fruto \u00e1 un m\u00e9dico home\u00f3pata, aunque sea por medio de un escrito \u00f3 de una carta   \nfrontpage.  \n12 Comellas quoted texts where they explained that what cause a specific disease or ailment was its own \ntherapeutic remedy. For instance, \u2018vomit cured vomit\u2019, or \u2018burnt skin was cured approaching the af fected \nparts to fire.\u2019  30 \n Nevertheless, the way Comellas constructed homeopathy in his book blurred the \nboundaries between professional and public medical knowledge and practice that elite physicians \nwere  trying to build. By using symptoms as the basis for disease understanding and the \nexperimental assessment of new drugs, homeopathy mirrored people\u2019s everyday somatic \nexperiences. Patients such as Anastasia Rodr\u00edguez could describe with no problem their pa in or \nmaladies; what circumstances modified them; the physical appearance of the affected or \nwounded part of the body; digestive sensations or disorders; characteristics of bodily fluids such \nas stools, urine, and expectorations; their skin appearance; fev ers; and sleeping disorders. These \nsomatic phenomena and symptoms constituted the homeopathic \u201cvital reaction \u201d. Through this \nconnection, patients could actually grasp through their personal experience what Comellas \nexplained in his book. Moreover, he used such intimate individual experiences to instruct his \nreaders about what they needed to know in order to identify a disease and report it to a doctor .13 \nThe connection between symptoms and disease diagnosis turned homeopathy into the medicine \nfor the people.  \nMoreover, the theoretical foundations of homeopathy attracted  the untrained public \nbecause they  framed disease understanding in an uplifting language that emphasized life rather \nthan death. Comellas explained that the homeopathic system was founded on the  idea that \u201clife \nwas the result of\u2026 an invisible, immaterial, dynamic, or virtual  principle, called vital force\u201d.14 \nThe efforts of the \u201cvital force\u201d against agents that disturbed the regular and organic harmo ny of \nthe body constituted the \u201c vital reaction \u201d. Emphasizing the idea that homeopathy was based on a \n\u201cvital force \u201d turned out to be much more uplifting to non-trained audiences  than heroic therapies \n                                                             \n13 Comellas, Rese\u00f1a sobre la homeopat\u00eda, dedicada a los mexicanos. R\u00e9gimen homeop\u00e1tico e instruccion \npara consultar con fruto \u00e1 un m\u00e9dico home\u00f3pata, aunque sea por medio de un escrito \u00f3 de una carta   20-4. \n14 Comellas, Rese\u00f1a sobre la homeopat\u00eda, dedicada a los mexicanos. R\u00e9gimen homeop\u00e1tico e instruccion \npara consultar con fruto \u00e1 un m\u00e9dico home\u00f3pata, aunque sea por medio de un escrito \u00f3 de una carta   8. 31 \n which debilitated the body and caused patients\u2019 discomfort .15 Moreover, rather than disease \nbeing a sign of the dissipation of vital strength, in the homeopathic system disease was precisely \nthe vital reaction that indicated that the body was fighting to recover its organic stability. In these \nterms, disease was les s an omen of death than a sign of life.  \nComellas\u2019s approach to introducing homeopathy into Mexican society bridged \nboundaries between homeopaths and patients that physicians with an approach based on \nanatomic pathology and heroic therapies could not. Comellas was clear about the importance of \nconsulting a physician. His book was specifically designed to train patients how to \u201cfruitfully \nconsult a homeopathic physician \u201d, as the book\u2019s subtitle stated .16 In that sense, he perpetuated \nthe tradit ional patient -doctor relationship. But homeopathy\u2019s symptomatic  approach and theory \nof disease based on vitalism allowed an actual conversation between patient and doctor  as a \nconsequence of a shared understanding of disease which translated into a common medical \nlanguage. Disease explanations that were foreign to patients\u2019 everyday experience together with \ninvasive or unpleasant therapies turned patients into subjects rather than participants in the \npatient -doctor relationship. Such differences s hifted patients\u2019 perceptions toward regular \nmedicine. While they regarded physicians and their practice as distant, antipathetic, despotic , and \nfrequently a sign of impending death ,17 Comellas\u2019 representation of homeopathic practice as \nempathetic , connected, and life -affirming made them prefer homeopathy.18  \n                                                             \n15 The people understood homeopathy as a gentle therapy based on the law of similar ity. For instance, in \n1857 one journalist criticized a new law to regulate the public press because it seemed homeopathic. \nFormer laws had not solved the problem the new one intended to. Rather, the journalist proposed to use \nemetics \u2013that is radical solut ions- to cure the \u2018legislative indigestion\u2019. \"Nueva ley de imprenta,\" Diario de \nAvisos  Miercoles 21 de enero 1857.  \n16 Comellas, Rese\u00f1a sobre la homeopat\u00eda, dedicada a los mexicanos.

Claudia Agos toni, \"M\u00e9dicos 32 \n Comellas\u2019 Rese\u00f1a also accommodated the liberal project through the means he used to \npublicize it. The liberal project sought to transform urban spaces into commercial landscapes ,19 \nand Co mellas\u2019 use of a newspaper t o advertise his  own book suggests he aimed to turn \nhomeopathy into a therapeutic commodity that better positioned him in the competitive medical \nmarketplace of Mexico City . He used patients\u2019 anxieties about contemporary heroic therapies to \nhighlight homeop athy\u2019s gentleness and, hence,  to attract customers. Accordingly, homeopat hy \nhad healing means that were \u201ctruthful, soft and expedite\u201d  and the homeopathic doctor did not \n\u201cmake the patient drink any repugnant beverage, use bloodletting or leeches to weaken t he \npatients\u2019 body, or torment the patient with mustard plasters, cupping, caustics, setons, etc.\u201d20 \nComellas aimed to position homeopathy in people\u2019s minds not by showing that it was a logically \nconsis tent, or scientifically proven \u2014 in other words, rationa l or positivist  \u2014 medical system, \nbut by accommodating it to people\u2019s needs.  \nHomeopathic practitioners had diagnostic tools that disrupted the nature of traditional \nmedical consultations , better positioning them in the competitive urban medical marketplace . \nThe traditional doctor -patient relationship, based on careful observation and follo w-up of \npatients\u2019 symptoms and \u2014 increasingly with the  adoption of pathologic anatomy \u2014 signs, \ndemanded the physical presence of the physician to actually diagn ose the patient. In this \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \necuestres, el arte de curar y los galenos en la historia nacional (Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, 1877 -1911),\" Ci\u00eanc. \nsa\u00fade coletiva Ci\u00eancia & Sa\u00fade Coletiva  13.3 (2008): 978 -9. Doctors\u2019 therapeutic approaches based on \nheroic therapies and surgery contri buted to the image of doctor as a messenger of death, too. John Harley \nWarner explains that throughout the nineteenth century American physicians slowly but progressively \nreduced the use of heroic therapies. The case of Mexican physicians remains to be stu died. John Harley \nWarner, The Therapeutic Perspective: Medical Practice, Knowledge, and Identity in America, 1820 -1885  \n(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1997).   \n18 For an example see Fenelon, \"CIRUG\u00cdA PR\u00c1CTICA. Carta del se\u00f1or Fenelon sobre vari os puntos de \ncirug\u00eda,\" Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico  IX.17 (1 de septiembre) (1874): 117 -8, 321 -3.  \n19 Steven Bunker explains how throughout the mid -nineteenth century, and propelled by liberal reforms, \nthree types of advertising developed in Mexico City, newspap ers being one of them. The other two were \nstreet hawking, and shop signs. Steven B. Bunker, Creating Mexican Consumer Culture in the Age of \nPorfirio D\u00edaz  (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2012) 59 -62.  \n20 \"Rese\u00f1a de la homeopat\u00eda  dedicada \u00e1 los  mexicanos.\"  33 \n traditional relationship, it was \u2014 more often than not wealthy  \u2014 families who summoned the \nphysician to their dwellings. There, the physician could closely follow the patient\u2019s natural \nhistory of disease and prescribe accordingly, consuming the entire physician\u2019s time. In contrast, \ntaking advantage of the homeopathic symptomatic approach to disease, a homeopathic physician \ndid not need to be physically present to make a diagnosis. Comellas\u2019 used this advantage in the \nnewspaper ad an d in the subtitle of his Rese\u00f1a , where  he proposed to inform people about the \n\u201chomeopathic regime and instruction to fruitfully consult a homeopathic physician,  at least by a \nletter or a text. \u201d21 Patients\u2019 stories that recounted symptoms were mailed to the homeopathic \nphysician, who did not waste time traveling from one patient\u2019s house to another and \nconsequently dedicated his time to diagnose from  the comfort of his private study, saving time \nand money. This non -physical mode of diagnosis might have appeale d to female patients who \ndid not want to expose their bodies to the scrutiny of someone else\u2019s eyes.  \nComellas \u2019 Rese\u00f1a introduced homeopathy to a Mexican audience, but could not alone \ncreate homeopathic practitioners. The availability of homeopathy books t hat linked names of \ndiseases, names of homeopathic remedies , and a list of both disease and drug symptoms in the \nMexican marketplace, however, did .22 With these books, a reader of Comellas\u2019 book had \neverything he or she needed to become a homeopathic practi tioner. For instance, J. C. Ruoff\u2019s \nGu\u00eda del home\u00f3pata  [The Homeopath\u2019s Guide] offered, as the subtitle expressed, a survey of \n                                                             \n21 Emphasis mine.

The advertisement reflects that the bookstore owner believed there \nwas a market for books about homeopathy, and suggests the growing interest  of residents in this topic. \nAmong the titles a patient interested in homeopathy could find were Ruoff\u2019s Gu\u00eda del home\u00f3pata , \nHering\u2019s Medicina homeop\u00e1tica , and Hartman\u2019s Tratado pr\u00e1ctico de terap\u00e9utica homeop\u00e1tica . \"De venta \nen la librer\u00eda franco -mexicana, \" La sociedad  S\u00e1bado 1 de mayo 1858. ; \"Libros nuevos que se hallan en \nventa en la librar\u00eda universal,\" La sociedad  Mi\u00e9rcoles 16 de febrero 1859. ; \"Verdadero beneficio a los \npadres de familia,\" Diario de Avisos  Mi\u00e9rcoles 4 de abril 1860.  34 \n \u201cmore than a thousand diseases \u201d that homeopathic physicians around the globe had successfully \ntreated . This text did not explain homeopathy. Instead, the author offered a catalogue of diseases \n\u201cusing the names of the old school nosology\u201d  with their correspondent homeopathic remedies.23 \nWith Comellas\u2019 and Ruoff\u2019s works, and other homeopathic treatises of the  1850s , the Mexican \nliterate public could \u201ctreat [themselves] with homeopathy in most cases, and in those urgent or \nserious ones, provide efficacious first aids to those who suffer from a disease until a homeopathic \nphysician arrives. \u201d24 Comellas\u2019 project o f popularizing homeopathy in Mexico turned out to be \nthe epitome of the liberal project in the medical sciences, turning it into a form of domestic \nmedicine, a practice that academic physicians critiqued for the same reasons they critiqued the \nhomeopathic lay practice, the sustraction of the academically trained doctor from the therapeutic \nintervention.25 \nIn contrast to medical elites\u2019 efforts to transform medical institutions yet retain the \nprivileges of professional stratification, Comellas \u2019 strategies to promote homeopathy used liberal \nsentiments and practices that threatened the stratified professional structure. Comellas\u2019 \npromotion of homeopathy promised to make accessible and public what physicians considered \n                                                             \n23 A. J. C.

While \nComellas\u2019 Rese\u00f1a homeopathy opened the possibility of having an understanding of the body \nand disease to any literate cit izen, it still preserved the traditional status of the physician and \npatient -doctor relationship . But with homeopathic domestic manuals, t hose who used \nhomeopathy did not need a physician anymore. Comellas\u2019 effort to popularize medical \nknowledge through hi s homeopathic manual evolved into ways to provide people with tools to \nheal themselves. With patients turning into homeopathic practitioners and practices that made \nthem competitive in the medical market place, homeopathy soon started to displace trained \nphysicians at the bedside. As I will analyze in the following section, domestic manuals became \none of the strategies to sell homeopathic commodities in the nascent medical marketplace in \nMexico City that resulted in an extended use of homeopathy amongst the  literate Mexican \npublic.  \nHomeopathy as a Medical Commodity: Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, Domestic Medicine and the Mexican \nMedical Marketplace  \nIn the 1860s homeopathy became a therapeutic brand. Jos\u00e9 Salvador Riera, a graduate of \nthe University of Yucat\u00e1n, advertise d his services in El Tabasque\u00f1o , offering to treat people \n\u201caccording to the circumstances \u201d with \u201callopathy or homeopathy\u201d.26 Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3 offered his \nservices at his homeopathic dispensary in 1857 .27 Homeopathy\u2019s widespread use led stores to \nspecifically target their products to consumers of homeopathic medicine. Chocolate companies \nadvertised products crafted specially without scents and substances that opposed the \nhomeopathic regime, and chocolate f actories in Mexico City even competed to offer products \n                                                             \n26 \"Jos\u00e9 Salvador Riera,\" El tabasque\u00f1o  Noviembre 23 1854.   \n27 \"Dispensario homeop\u00e1tico,\" Diario de Avisos  12 de noviembre 1857.  The same ad appeared in the \nsame daily newspaper throughout October and November.  36 \n that homeopathic physicians  authorized .28  Homeopathic dispensaries and drugstores started to \npopulate the landscape of Mexico City. Pascual Bielsa sold first -aid kits and administered his \nown homeopat hic dispensary ,29 and Mariano Omedes de Viela, who started offering his services \nas a homeopathic physician in September 1867 , opened a dispensary i n December of that same \nyear and w as still offering its services in  1870 .30 The \u201cGeneral Agency of the Leipsik  [sic] \nCentral Institute of Homeopat hy\u201d and the \u201cDeposit of Homeopathic Medicines \u201d offered \nhomeopathic books, medicines , and other materials for the homeopathic practitioner in the mid \n1870s.31 This trend suggests that there was a market of providers, both apothecaries and \nphysicians, and consumers of homeopathy. However, what furthered people\u2019s appropriation of \nhomeopathy as domestic medicine was the s elling of homeopathic manuals together with ready -\nto-use homeopathic first -aid kits.  \nJuli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez playe d a central role in transforming homeopathy from a medical system \nused by physicians into a therapeutic commodity with which patients could self -medicate. He \nbecame acquainted with homeopathy through Comellas\u2019 ads around 1850, when seeking \ntreatment for ch ronic enteritis .32 The effectiveness of Comellas\u2019 homeopathic treatment produced \n                                                             \n28 \"Importante,\" Diari o de Avisos  10 de marzo 1860. ; \"Chocolate homeop\u00e1tico,\" Diario de Avisos  21 de \nagosto 1860. ; \"Antigua y acreditada f\u00e1brica de chocolate superior, esquina de las calles de Cordobanes y \nsegunda de Santo Domingo,\" Diario de Avisos  21 de agosto 1860. ; and \"Cho clate superior de las clases \nsiguientes,\" Diario de Avisos  22 de septiembre 1860.  \n29 See correspondence between Pascual Bielsa, the minister of Governance, the government of the Federal \nDistrict and the Superior Sanitary Board, AHSS, SP, EM, 3, 53.  \n30 \"Dr. M.

He healed, but the drug \nproduced chronic enteritis. Gonzalez does not specify how long he suffered of this health problem, but \nbeing chronic suggests a long and persistent conditio n.

In 1873, he started a dvertising his dispensary as a \u201c Homeop athic \nDrugstore\u201d. 40 Moreover, he offered \u201ca great variety of homeopathic first -aid kits and portable \ndrugstores \u201d41 that w ere specifically \u201cuseful for trav elers, rural populations and haciendas , who \nnot always are in the condition to receive professional medical assistance. \u201d42 He recommended \nhis Tratado  as the most suitable to use the homeopathic kits. Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez used the popularity \nof homeopathy to tran sform his drugstore into the most important homeopathic pharmacy in \nMexico in the second half of the nineteenth  century .43  \nBy bringing laissez -faire politics into medicine, Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s approach to sell ing \nhomeopathy exploited the modern liberal political ec onomy that aimed to detach Mexico from its \ncolonial economic structures and push it forward as a modern nation .44 Through this approach he \nalso transformed the way the public consumed homeopathy. His manuals, first -aid kits, and \nportable drugstores became a  means by which people could entirely appropriate their own health, \nrather than simply consult with success a homeopathic physician, as Comellas pretended. \n                                                             \n39 This work eventually turne d into the main text with which Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez publicized homeopathy.

Gonzalez reiteratively \nadvertised his drug store in La Colonia Espa\u00f1ola during December and January 1878 -9. \n43 His was the most conspicuous, but not the only one. For instance, M. Omedes de Viela started offering \nhis services as a homeopathic physician in  the 1860s in the same terms as Comellas, but a decade later he \nstarted using it as a brand for therapeutic remedies, just like Gonz\u00e1lez did. \"Dr. M.

This \nwould be unattainable for a family. But a complete homeopathic first -aid kit, no \nmatter how b ig, can be carried along any distance by a single person who needs \nno more than carefully and persistently consult the manual to use the kit.45 \n  \nThe public reception of Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s homeopathic manuals and products was divided. \nAcademic physicians labeled it  a lucrative business that had nothing to do with medicine .46 Jos\u00e9 \nGalindo, a graduate of the National School of Medicine, considered Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s approach \nto sell ing homeopathic manuals and first -aid kits as a robbery, and those who pursued healing as  \nGonz\u00e1lez recommended as \u201cspeculat ors\u201d of health. According to Galindo, the homeopathic \nbusiness had a \u201c low risk \u201d and was \u201cproductive\u201d .  \n[A] speculator \u2026 invests 22 pesos in Freleigh\u2019s manual and first -aid kit, the most \nexpensive and complete one, and assum ing that he treats two patients a day who \npay 2 pesos for the homeopathic consultation, he earns 120 pesos a month. With \nit, he recovers the investment and has a huge profit only by visiting two patients \nand reading the manual two or three hours a day.47 \n  \nFrancisco Flores de As\u00ed s, another graduate of the medical school, severely critiqued \nmanuals of domestic medicine and the people who used them in 1886 . He argued that \u201cthe mob\u201d  \nused \u201cthe jumble that swarmed [the city] and which was pretentiou sly called \u2018do mestic \nmedicines\u2019\u201d  to \u201ctreat the sick only after [the mob] has  learned from a [trained] physician the \ndisease diagnosis. \u201d These practitioners or aficionados  got rid of the physician once they learned \n                                                             \n45 Gonz\u00e1lez, Tratado pr\u00e1ctico de homeopat\u00eda y gu\u00eda de las familias   xvii. \n46 This rhetoric of marginalization was typical within the community of academic physicians during the \nsecond half of the 19th century. In order to consolidate their professional status, academic physicians \ndistanced themselves from popu lar approaches to health and disease, labeling them as unscientific. \nAgostoni, \"M\u00e9dicos cient\u00edficos y m\u00e9dicos il\u00edcitos en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico durante el Porfiriato,\" 977 -9. \n47 Jos\u00e9 Galindo, \"La homeopat\u00eda,\" El observador m\u00e9dico  II.18, 20, 21 and 22 (julio, septiembre, octubre y \nnoviembre) (1873).

For him, domestic manuals of medicine usurped, to the patient\u2019s harm, the \ndoctor\u2019s place at the bedside, for it was only the \u201cphysician\u2019s eye \u201d, the trained medical gaze \nacquired in \u201cgood books of me dicine and through a not -poor medical practice \u201d, the single means \nto diagnose a disease accurately.48 Physicians\u2019 critiques expressed their discomfort about the \ncommercial use of homeopathy and domestic medicine in a competitive medical marketplace. \nTheir p rofessional status as graduates of the National School of Medicine made them adopt a \nposition that privileged the scientific medical knowledge they had received at the medical school  \nto distance themselves from other healing practices .  \nIn contrast, the pu blic embraced Go nz\u00e1lez\u2019s products and publicity , prizing them as either \nan effort that \u201cbenefited all the classes of society \u201d by bringing health to the population49 or a \nproof of \u201cgenerosity, detachment ,\u2026 charity,\u2026  kindness [, and] philanthropy \u201d.50 Generally, those \nwho consumed Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s homeopathic products were patients who just like him had been \nsuccessfully treated with homeopathy and who dedicated their lives to understand ing how it \nworked, popularizing  its use, and provid ing homeopathic treat ment,  in other words, those who m \nGalindo criticized. It was the y who boasted the benefits of homeopathy and the philanthropy of \ntheir homeopathic providers, as in the case of Luis Alva. He was one of Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s patients. In \nreturn for Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s kindness a nd effective treatment, Alva decided to publicize homeopathy \nthrough a pamphlet in 1883 .51 This pamphlet was later reprinted in the fourth edition of \nGonz\u00e1lez\u2019s Treatise , where Alva congratulated Gonz\u00e1lez for his medical intervention and \naltruistic behavior .  \n                                                             \n48 Flores y Troncoso, \"Ejercicio de la medicina en el per\u00edodo positivo,\"   254 -6.  \n49 \"Tratado pr\u00e1ctico homeop\u00e1tico,\" El Combate  4 de mayo 1879.  \n50 Gonz\u00e1lez, Tratado pr\u00e1ctico de homeopat\u00eda y gu\u00eda de las familias   537-608, 539 -40.  \n51 Luis Alva, La homeopat\u00eda y la alopat\u00eda ante la humanidad doliente y ante la raz\u00f3n  (M\u00e9xico: Manuel S. \nGutierrez, 1883).  41 \n According to reports published by homeopathic practitioners, patients\u2019 gratitude praised \nhomeopathic treatment itself, rather than Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s products and publicity. But it was evident \nthat such reports aimed to attract a larger clientele. Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1l ez and other homeopathic \npractitioners used their patients\u2019 reports as proof of the effectiveness of homeopathy. For \ninstance, Gonz\u00e1lez advertised that his homeopathic remedies were famous because they healed \npatients deemed incurable by famous doctors. Fu rthermore, he included his clinical statistics of \nsuccess in the ad, \u201c4000 blood impurities, 230 skin diseases, 414 stomach diseases, 102 urinary \ndiseases, 60 eye diseases, and 534 diseases that were not mentioned. \u201d52 Most of these reports \nwere similarly st ructured to praise the clinical successes of homeopathic practitioners. Due to, \nfor instance, a discouraging prognosis or the harming effects of heroic medications, distressed \npatients sought another medical option, homeopathy; patient\u2019s choice s improved t heir health \ncondition and left them satisfied with the outcome. It is unclear who wrote such reports : patients, \nhomeopathic practitioners themselves, or both , the former to show their gratitude, and the latter \nto increase their clientele. In any case, the publication of these reports was solely the \nhomeopathic practitioners\u2019 responsibility, which raises doubts about their authenticity.  \nSome reports added other elements to heighten their credibility, like the impartiality of \nthe observer who reported the ca se of Rafael Navarre te, a homeopathic practitioner who had \nsuccessfully treated a child with Croup , a breathing difficulty caused by inflammation of the \nvocal cords especially in infants and children . The reporter started his note by clarifying that he \nwas not particularly fond of the homeopathic system, but having evidenced the  \u201cpractical \nresults \u201d, \u201cpalpa ble facts \u201d, and \u201chappy healings \u201d made him acknowledge the new system\u2019s \neffectiveness. The construction of the reporter\u2019s credibility was based on his inte llectual distance \nfrom the homeopathic system and hence his nature as an impartial observer. Yet when the \n                                                             \n52 The latter category might have referred to venereal diseases. \"Botica homeop\u00e1tica.\"   42 \n impartial reporter recognized that it was his friend who acquainted him with the facts, the \nreporter\u2019s credibility seems to crumble.53  \nWho should the reader of such a case report believe : the impartial reporter or the gratified \npatient? For medically trained physicians such as Jos\u00e9 Galindo, these reports were a clear \nexample of how to \u201cdeceive na\u00efve people\u201d , but patients willing to find a cure might hav e read \nthem otherwise .54 When Guadalupe L\u00f3pez de Herrera consulted Miguel Alva, a homeopathic \npractitioner, he recommended she receive spiritual counseling for he was not sure if homeopathy \ncould do anything for her peritonitis, but the \u201cpersistence, effica cy and determination \u201d of the \npractitioner achieved the \u201csurprising \u201d and unexpected healing .55 The use of outstanding \nhomeopathic clinical successes continued until the first decade of the twentieth century, when \nnot only patients reported successful cases, but also authorities such as the police from all over \nthe country provided certificates to homeopathic practitioners who healed and \u201csaved thousands \nof people, most of them with terrible progn ostic s, without having any dead .\u201d56 \n                                                             \n53 A. G. B. [Alfredo G. Bianchi], \"La homeopat\u00eda,\" El Ferrocarril  10 de julio 1871.   \n54 Gabino Barreda introduced the idea of homeopathy as a means to deceive na\u00efve people . In 1861, he \npublished La homeopat\u00eda, o juicio critico sobre este nuevo medio para enga\u00f1ar a los c\u00e1ndidos  \n[Homeopathy, or a critical appraisal of this new means to deceive na\u00efve people]. Academic physicians \nused the arguments contained in this work to dis credit homeopathy throughout the second half of the 19th \ncentury. It was reprinted in 1877 with a different name in Gabino Barreda, \"La homeopat\u00eda \u00f3 juicio cr\u00edtico \nsobre este nuevo sistema,\" Op\u00fasculos, discusiones y discursos coleccionados y publicados por  la \nSociedad Metod\u00f3fila Gabino Barreda , ed.

Finally, it was printed \nin 1934 as a monograph, by Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica , the medical journal of the Union of Physicians from the \nFede ral District.  \n55 F. O., \"Sorprendente curaci\u00f3n,\" El Combate  27 de junio 1880.  \n56 For instance see letters addressed to Juan Pablo de los R\u00edos in the 1890s showing the unexpected \nhealings he achieved with homeopathy. \"El Sr. D. Juan Pablo de los R\u00edos,\" El Cor reo Espa\u00f1ol  18 de \nnoviembre 1890. ; \"El Dr. Juan Pablo de los R\u00edos,\" El Correo Espa\u00f1ol  1 de enero 1891. ; and \"El Sr. Dr. D. \nJuan Pablo de los R\u00edos,\" El Correo Espa\u00f1ol  6 de enero 1891.  See also the reports published in \"Al \np\u00fablico,\" La propaganda homeop\u00e1tica  IV.4 (1904).   43 \n The interpretation of such reports is complicated by academic physicians\u2019 reports of \nhomeopathic practice. In 1874, Juan Fenelon, a member of the recently created National \nAcademy of Medicine, reported a case describing a woma n who suffered from hemorrhages. \nAfter being treated by several physicians and then using \u201cordinary remedies \u201d, another physician \ndiagnosed a uterine polyp, a mass of cells that grew within the uterus and caused the bleeding. \nBut facing surgery, the patient  and her family decided to consult a homeopath , who according to \nFenelon fed the patient\u2019s and her familiy\u2019s fears and offered them \u201ca miraculous healing\u201d . When \nthe family sought Fenelon\u2019s opinion, he found the patient in a state close to death, yet \u201cthey were \nnot determined to abandon homeopathy. \u201d Fenelon even highlighted that Mr. Navarrete ,57 the \nhomeopath treating the woman, had made special emphasis on not bathing the patient, a situation \nthat worsened the infection she was suffering. Fenelon notified th e family of the imminent \ndanger of an i nfection and another hemorrhage  and recommended to anesthetize the patient in \norder to make the proper diagnosis and indicate possible ways of acting. Fenelon finished his \nreport emphasizing his indignation with \u201cthe guilty ignorance of a curandero , that allowed [a \npatient] to reach such a deplorable state in a curable disease, \u201d and lamenting similar cases that \ndid not reach  the public arena. He offered to publish his own observations of such malpractices, \n\u201cif only the  public was not fond of being deceived.\u201d58  \nWhat coincides in both homeopaths\u2019 and academic physicians\u2019 reports of clinical cases \nwhere homeopathy was used as the main treatment is that patients were satisfied and willing to \ncontinue homeopathic treatments in spite of the most adverse medical situations. To Fenelon\u2019s \nsurprise, patients preferred to stay with homeopathy and face death rather than surrender their \n                                                             \n57 This homeopath might have certainly been Rafael Navarrete. \"ACADEMIA DE MEDICINA.

This preference reveals homeopaths\u2019 ability to \nattract customers and keep them faithful to the ir therapeutic approac h. Homeopaths\u2019 strategy to \ncommercialize their therapeutic innovation was effective in te rms of patients\u2019 satisfaction and \ncommitment to stick with one specific therapeutic approach. Moreover, academic physicians \nimplicitly recognized such success when they criticized the profit homeopaths made or when \nthey accused academic physicians who used  homeopathy as \u201cimmoral [people] whose \nspeculative conduct led them to robbery. \u201d59  \nThe popularity of homeopathy amongst patients attested to the success of homeopaths in \npenetrating the healing marketplace. These accounts also prove the success of homeopat hs in \nadvertising and addressing their therapeutic system to the people. For homeopathic \nentrepreneurs, patients\u2019 satisfaction was the core of their campaign to extend the use of \nhomeopathy. What remains unclear is the source of patients\u2019 fear of academic doctors\u2019 \ntherapeutic interventions. Did they prefer homeopathy because they believed it produced \nsurprising healings, as homeopathic entrepreneurs advertised and patients\u2019 reports suggest? Were \nthey simply responding to the interventional diagnostic and th erapeutic approach of pathologic \nanatomy? Were there other beliefs involved in patients\u2019 choice? To explore these questions in \ngreater depth and  understand the context in which patients\u2019 appropriated and use homeopathy, I \nwill analyze the homeopathic practice of one of the pivotal political leaders at the turn of the \ntwentieth  century, Francisco I. Madero.  \n                                                             \n59 Galindo, \"La homeopat\u00eda.\" , for this specific quote see \u201cLa Homeopat\u00eda,\u201d El observador m\u00e9dico  II.18 \n(julio) ( 1873 ). 45 \n Francisco I. Madero and the Domestic Prac tice of Homeopathy in Rural Mexico  \nMadero\u2019s iconic place in the political history of Mexico and his unorthodox religious and \nmedical beliefs inclined the historian Enrique Krauze to call him the \u201cmystic of freedom \u201d.60 \nMadero\u2019s life represents the cultural values that dominated amongst social and economic elites in \nMexico in the last decades of the nineteenth  century. The modern education based in science he \nreceived together with their deep religious beliefs combined i nto a fertile ground where \nhomeopathy flourished. Madero\u2019s use of homeopathy was not a result of homeopaths\u2019 publicity \nand promotion, nor did his political inclinations lead him to a medical practice that ran against \nprofessional corporate bodies. Rather, his interest in healing stood at the base of his religious -\nbased moral transformation. His experiences using homeopathy both as a patient and as a \npractitioner, together with his spiritualist practices and magnetic healing, are a window to \nunderstand how t his medical novelty fit in the cultural landscape of rural Mexico, where elites \noffered modern medical commodities as charity to their workers at the turn of the twentieth  \ncentury.  \nFrancisco I. Madero (1873 \u20131911) was the first son of one of the wealthiest families in \nnorthern Mexico. As such he received an elite education in Mexico, France , and the United \nStates .61 The training in business administration and agriculture he received in Paris and at \nBerkeley allowed him to successfully run his family\u2019s ranchos  and businesses. Yet it was the \ncontact with Allan Kardec\u2019s spiritualist philosophy in Paris in 1889 that marked his personal life. \nHe confesse d in his memoirs that the Catholic religio n seemed to him \u201c obscure and irrational \u201d, \n                                                             \n60 Enrique Krauze, Francisco I. Madero. M\u00edstico de la liber tad, Biograf\u00eda del poder, vol. II (Mexico: \nFondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica, 1987).  \n61 He studied at a Jesuit school in Saltillo, the Saint Mary College in Baltimore, the School of High \nStudies of Commerce, and at the Department of Agriculture in the University of California, Berkeley. As \na result of this education, he became fluent in Fren ch and English. Francisco Ignacio Madero, Memorias , \nObras completas de Francisco Ignacio Madero, ed. Alejandro Rosas, vol. I, IX vols.

When Madero read Allan Kardec\u2019s works, he \u201cdevoured \u201d them. He \nfound his \u201cdoctrines so rational, so beautiful, [and] so new \u201d that he was \u201cseduced \u201d. Madero \nbecame a \u201cspiritualist \u201d, though he did not actually practice d spiritualism un til he experienced the \nsolitude of the rural life in 1893 .62  \nThe connection between spiritualism, charity, and healing is pivotal to understand ing the \nkey role that health and dise ase played in Madero\u2019s moral transformation. Madero define d \nspiritualism as a \u201cscience that investigates the forces of the human spirit \u201d. Such science led to a \nspecific form of ethics according to which every person\u2019s duty was to pursue happiness by \nstrugg ling against his or her bad inclinations . These included emotional attitudes such as anger, \negoism, and vanity, as well as more material  vices such as alcoholism, overeating, and other \npleasures. \u201cWith these vices, health and will are rapidly lost \u201d, Madero  said. He argued that \nspiritualism, hard work, and charity helped a person to overcome such inclinations and vices, but \nhealing above all provided the best means to personal development.63 \nMadero practiced such means. When he learned about homeopathy in 189 6,64 he used it \nfor charitable purposes.  He personally visited his peones to prescribe homeopathic remedies and \ncomfort them in their diseases. One of his intimate friends said that \u201c in the city, someone could \nsee how diseased menesterosos [working -class people] besieged him; and he comforted their \n                                                             \n62 Madero settled permanently in Mexico in this yea r.

V., 2000).  \n64 There is no consensus about who precisely introduced Francisco I. Madero to homeopathy. Krauze says \nthat Madero\u2019s father and uncle, Catarino Benavides, introduced him to homeopathy. Madero says in his \nMemoires that he learned about it when Colonel Carlos Herrera asked his father to bring a homeopathic \nfirst-aid kit. Krauze, Francisco I. Madero.

One of the \nspirits told him \u201cyour disease is a punishment too, and you will not heal until you correct \nyourself. I am sure that if you healed now, you would follow the path of corruption you were in \nbefore \u201d.67 For this reason, Madero stopped smoking after being sick, drinking after his mother \nfell sick with typhoid fever, and married Sara P\u00e9rez to leave a dissolute life.  \nSpiritual communications also informed him about the need for disease to strengthen his \nbond with spiritual forces and the link that healing created between the medium and spirits. For \ninstance, one spirit explained that a long and harsh disease made her die softly, because such a \ndisease process \u201cmade her spirit detach from  the matter little by little \u201d to the extent that when she \npassed away her \u201cspirit was free already \u201d.68 According to Madero\u2019s \u201cspiritualist morality \u201d, \nhealing was the most important means of charity through which individuals participated in \naltruistic activi ties that in turn strengthen ed their connection with spiritual forces and facilitated \n                                                             \n65 Cited in Krauze, Francisco I.

He organized a poorhouse in his own dwellings \nwhere he fed and provi ded shelter to the poor. With his wife, Sara P\u00e9rez, he supported orphans and \nstudents, and founded elementary and commercial schools, welfare institutions, hospitals, and community \nkitchens.  \n66 For the historian Madero\u2019s spiritualist letters represent an ex cellent window to his thought. While \nattending spiritualist groups in Paris, mediums told him that he was a writing medium, one who writes \nwhat spirits dictate. At that time, he tried to develop such gift without success and quit his attempts. \nMadero, Memorias   34-5. One night when his brother, Manuel Madero, suffered a gastric fever, he \nresumed his experiments as a writing medium and realize that \u2018a force strange to [his] will moved his \nhand speedily.\u2019 Once he became comfortable and confident with this  new condition -especially with \n\u201cRa\u00fal\u201d, the spirit of his younger brother who died tragically in 1887 - Madero started to use such ability to \nseek moral reassurance and medical advice, particularly guidance about remedy election with the spirits.  \n67 See the  letter of 9 January 1901, in Madero, Cuadernos esp\u00edritas, 1900 -1908   35. Six months later, on 9 \nMay 1901, the spirit of Ra\u00fal told Francisco Madero that he believed that Madero\u2019s headache was a \nconsequence of abusing tobacco, and he commanded him to \u2018stop smoking, because such a foolish vice \ndoes not do any good to you and it profoundly harms your health.\u2019 Madero, Cuadernos esp\u00edritas, 1900 -\n1908   41. \n68 Letter of 26 May 1902, in Madero, Cuadernos esp\u00edritas, 1900 -1908   91. 48 \n their spiritual development. Raul\u2019s spirit specifically equated medicine with \u201cthe power of \nworking as intermediaries of good spirits who came to heal those who suffered. \u201d Being an \nintermediary \u201c elevated the spirits of [those who participated in spiritualist sessions] over \nothers.\u201d69 Such medical gift was a \u201clight\u201d that \u201cshould be used to enlighten the path of your \nbrothers, once it has withdrawn all of you [in the spiritua list session] from darkness \u201d.70 \nThe notion of a connection between spiritual fluidic forces that linked the physical body \nwith some sort of spiritual realm mirrored Comellas\u2019 homeopathic concept of the \u201cvital force\u201d , \nmaking homeopathy a perfect fit as a med ical system for Madero\u2019s notion of healing as a way to \npurification. Madero described in his Manual esp\u00edrita  that \u201cfuerzas an\u00edmicas [psychic forces] \ncame neither exclusively from spiritual nor material sources, and that their complex and mixed \nnature worke d admirably as proof that our material body was ruled by a spiritual entity. \u201d71 He \nargued that \u201cpsychic phenomena\u201d , particularly the workings of magnetism, evidenced that such \nwas the constitution of the human  being . Accordingly, \u201cmagnetism was the vital fluid that \nworked as intermediary between the soul and the body. When such a fluid weakens, there is \ndisease; when it vanishes, death .\u201d72 Madero explained the disease cause and the processes of \nhealing with magnetism. He said that severe wounds may cause de ath because they obstructed \nchannels of vital fluid circulation in the body , or that the transmission of \u201chealthy and strong\u201d  \nvital fluid to a \u201cweakened organism \u201d produced \u201ca reaction in the fluids of the latter \u201d that healed \nphysical complaints. One spirit  told him that magnetism was useful specifically in treating \ndiseases caused by \u201cmoral infections \u201d, colds, physical weakening and nervous diseases .73 Such \ndescriptions of the workings of fluidic forces in the process of healing mirrored Comellas\u2019 and \n                                                             \n69 Letter on December 2, 1901, Madero, Cuadernos esp\u00edritas, 1900 -1908   65. \n70 Letter on 9 March 1902, Madero, Cuadernos esp\u00edritas, 1900 -1908   79. \n71 Madero, \"Manual Esp\u00edrita,\"   79 -80. \n72 Madero, \"Manual Esp\u00edrita,\"   96 -7. \n73 Letter of 18 August 1901, in Madero, Cuadernos esp\u00edritas, 1900 -1908  271. 49 \n the re st of homeopaths\u2019 explanations of how homeopathic remedies worked and the specific \nusefulness of homeopathy in chronic diseases.74  \nIt is unclear to what extent homeopathy influenced Madero\u2019s spiritualist beliefs or the \nother way round.  He studied the latt er earlier than the former, but the language, expressions , and \nreflections used when referring to the processes of healing, the connection of emotions with \ndisease, choosing a homeopathic remedy and its dosage, and following a specific regime are so \nabunda nt in the homeopathic literature that it is difficult to trace the precise origin of such ideas \nin Madero\u2019s system of thought. Yet rather than causation, the link between homeopathy and \nspiritualism shows the congruity of such ideologies in a coherent set of beliefs that guided \nMadero\u2019s healing practices. Moreover, for Madero, both spiritualism and homeopathy were \nempirical sciences. They provided alternative yet modern ways to reflect about religion and \nmorality in a secular world  and about healing in a co ntext with limited access to trained \nphysicians .75 \n                                                             \n74 Madero was simply following the historical trend where Mesmerism -a therapeutic approach that used \nfirst magnets and then the therapist own vital magnetism, hence the name of animal magnetism, for \nhealing purposes - evolved into different forms of mind hea ling, such as Ellen G. White Seventh -Day \nAdventists, Christian Science, and Theosophy.

Madero, \n\"Manual Esp\u00edrita,\"   96 -108. According to homeopathy, the quest to find the right medication for a \nspecific diseases case was a permanent process of experimentation, as it wa s the quest to find the medical \nproperties of natural substances. Maderos\u2019 spiritualist letters show a constant concern to find the right \nhomeopathic remedy, though his personal correspondence evidences his reassurance with homeopathy, \nprobably resulting f rom his personal reflections/communications with spirits. Raul\u2019s spirit constantly \nguided Madero in the election of a homeopathic remedy on the latter\u2019s specific request, or reassured him \nin the election of his own. Francisco Ignacio Madero, Epistolario (1 900-1909) , Archivo de Don Francisco \nI. Madero, vol. I, 2 vols.

Consumers, such as Madero,  with a modern mentality, yet isolated from the burgeoning \ncultural, political , and economic cent er Mexico City  was, used  it as patients and healers. Madero \nbecame an avid consumer of homeopathic literature and first -aid kits, offered both in Mexico \nCity and abroad .76 He bought his first homeopathic manuals from Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez in 1899 and \ncontinued ob taining homeopathic supplies from him throughout his life .77 Madero\u2019s relatives \npreferred Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s kits because they \u201c believed that it was better to use [Gonzalez\u2019s] specifics \nrather than other first -aid kits which required a deeper study .\u201d78 Such a commen t testifies to how \nwell Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s publicity fit landowners\u2019 medical needs in the countryside. At unpopulated \nalmost desolate places in the northern part of Mexico, people needed concise domestic manuals \nthat filled the gap left by physicians\u2019 absence.  \nMadero\u2019s homeopathic practice provided healing services to his family and peones.  He \nregistered accounts of the peones  he treated between 1901 and 1902 .79 The importance of \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nHis personal correspondence also shows Madero\u2019s interest in proving \u2013the homeopathic word for testing - \nthe medicinal properties of native plants. Madero, Epistolario (1900 -1909)   50, 215.  \n76 For instance, Madero requested books from foreign providers. Most of them were related to \nspiritualism, though among these he also asked for titles about magnetism such as Delaye\u2019s Instrucci\u00f3n \npr\u00e1ctica de magnetism animal , Derville\u2019s Aplicaci\u00f3n del im\u00e1n al tratamiento de las infermedades , \nDerville\u2019s Procedimientos magn\u00e9t icos, Derville\u2019s Leyes f\u00edsicas del magnetismo , and Derville\u2019s El \nmagnetismo humano.

Gonz\u00e1lez Sucs of 21 October 1900, Madero, Epistolario (1900 -1909)   18. \n79 Madero entered 248 patients\u2019 names in his booklet out of which he explicitly identified 13 as recurring \npatients. This figure leaves 235 patients\u2019 entries. 60% were women and 40% men, ranging from 2 months \nof age to 75 years with an average of 40. Madero explicitly used the category of age, yet he did not \nexplicitly register the category of sex. Using names and maladies that exclusively identify women I \nobtained a sex ratio of 0.42 men, 0.57 women. Entries dates range from 27 March 1901 to 25 November \n1902 . Most of the times he has from one to five entries registered for one single day, though there were \nexceptional days when he entered up to 16 cases. Assuming that entries represent Madero\u2019s interactions \nwith his patients, we can say that he had regular vi sits during the second half of 1901. These largely 51 \n Madero\u2019s clinical notes  lies in their private and personal nature. In contrast to patients\u2019 accounts \nedited and published as publicity for homeopathy, or actual clinical histories carried out by \nhomeopathic physicians, Madero\u2019s notes are homeopathic clinical practice in the making, with \nno sec ondary reflections about how well or not such observations fit the homeopathic corpus or \npraised homeopathic treatments\u2019 success. It is uncertain to what extent Madero transcribed his \npatients\u2019 descriptions, or if he somehow filtered them .80 In any case, hi s note taking represents a \nconstruction between the patient and the practitioner that shows how both understood disease.  \nIn Madero\u2019s clinical notes , disease can be a symptom, an anatomical part, or what we \nwould currently identify as disease s with a micro biological origin.  Madero\u2019s descriptions of \nsymptoms discussed evacuations, whether from the sexual  organs , digestive organs, or the skin; \nsome sorts of pain, such as numbness, burning sensation, colic, and cramps; fever; nervous \ndisorders, like delusions,  attacks, faintness, and insomnia; and skin rashes, swellings, sores, and \nmarks. He sometimes used technical terms to refer to such symptoms, such as when he used \nblennorrhagia to describe white or yellow discharges from sexual organs, yet he sometimes use d \nthe term as a disease category, such as when a male patient described \u201ca strong pain when \nurinating, but with no discharge, which made [Madero] think about a possible blennorrhagia .\u201d81 \nLacking a disease classification, Madero sometimes referred to symptom s as a sickness at \nspecific organs. He also used current disease categories, yet it is unclear if he referred to the \ngroup of signs and symptoms that we currently correlate with them , or even if he actually \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \ndecreased in 1902. As to whether he visited them or otherwise is hard to suggest a general trend from the \nbooklet. His notes suggest that sometimes some patients visited him, but in these cases they did it  to \nexplain changes in symptoms or to express total recovery after Madero had first prescribed some remedy.  \n80 While most reports are taken directly from patients\u2019 accounts, some of them suggest that symptoms of \nother patients were referred to him by a thi rd party.  \n81 Madero\u2019s clinical booklet in ASHCP, FHFIM, 27. He used interchangeably -that is as symptoms and \ndiseases - other technical terms such as metrorraghia to refer to irregular menstruations; intermittent to \nrefer to the periodicity and evolution of fevers; chancres; rehuma or rheumatism, to explain some sort of \npain or discomfort in specific body parts, and neuralgia, to refer headaches.  52 \n understood their microbiological origin . Though n ot particularly abundant in his booklet, herpes, \ndysentery, influenza, pertussis, typhoid fever, pneumonia, flu, and consumption figured as \ndisease categories.  \nDisease etiology was seldom mentioned, and when Madero, or his patient ventured to \nexplain the cause of disease, it did not influence remedy election. Disease etiologies have a \nregular pattern in his clinical notes. Generally, susto  [fright], disgusto [disgust], and coraje  \n[anger] caused pain, or  menstrual disorders; food caused indigestion, stomac haches, and \ndiarrhea; and alcohol ingestion was correlated to liver and nervous illnesses. Some of these \netiologies were guessed by patients su ch as when a male reported \u201c several rheumatic pains which \n[the patient] attributed to thermal work \u201d, while some o thers were either endorsed or guessed by \nMadero, such as when one patient showed up with \u201ca swelling nose produced by breathi ng in the \npresence of a cadaver.\u201d82 These two forms of reporting imply that Madero either agreed with the \npatient\u2019s explanation and consequently made it his own, or doubted about the patient\u2019s reported \netiology and made it clear that it was not his own.   \nRemedy selection is difficult to evaluate since Madero did not explicitly register the \nreasons why he chose specific remedies. Somet imes he just reported the remedy without even \nannotating the patient symptoms. In other entries he used the same remedy for different \nsymptomatic descriptions. For instance he used Belladon na in people sick at the stomach, tonsils, \nor liver, or with cough,  nervous attacks, burning sores, swollen eyes, sore throats, headaches, \nblenorrhagia, and so on. There are other remedies that Madero used specifically for certain \ncomplaints, nevertheless. For instance, Merc Sol , an acronym for Mercurius solubilis , was used \nin every patient that had skin rashes or whenever the patient\u2019s wounded part needed to discharge. \n                                                             \n82 See the clinical report of Herminio Hernandez and Francisco Tapia, respectively. Madero\u2019s clinical \nbooklet in A SHCP, FHFIM, 57, 56.  53 \n He preferred to use remedies that indicated they suited the environment Madero\u2019s peones lived \nin.83 His magnetic passes or water were generally combi ned with homeopathic medicines, yet he \nonly used magnetism in cases that hinted at an emotional etiology that produced headaches, chest \npain, nervous attacks, and general body weakness and pain.  \nMadero struggled to find the adequate remedy for his patient s. For instance, Pilar Pinales \nshowed up with scabies and menstrual disorders, and Madero prescribed Pulsatilla . Two months \nlater Madero reported \u201cNo effect and I gave her Sulfur 1000a \u201d; six weeks later, \u201cNo effect and I \ngave her magnetized pills \u201d; three w eeks later, \u201cthey did not work, Nux moscata \u201d; one week later, \n\u201cDidn\u2019 t work. Ferrum net. Didn\u2019t work\u201d ; six months later he prescribed magnetic pills .84 \nSometimes homeopathic medicines improved certain conditions, but Madero needed to use new \nhomeopathic reme dies t o attack complaints that persisted , such as in the case of Laura Ram\u00edrez \nwho suffered from rheumatism . He recommended Aconito and Arnica , but \u201cmedicines were not \ngiven as prescribed and she showed a poor relief. She has diarrhea \u2026 and is thirsty. Arse nico\u201d ; a \ncouple of days later he changed to Pulsatilla 30a; and three days later \u201cpains diminished, she \nhealed from diarrhea and was almost entirely well. \u201d But two days later, Madero noted that \nrheumatic pains resumed. He prescribed Bryonia , which didn\u2019t w ork and changed to Rhus Toxica \n30a, which did. Three days later she showed up with a rash throughout her body. While Merc Sol  \n\u201cdried \u201d the rash, the patient was left with headaches and swollen feet. Madero used magnetism, \nand the headache subsided, but the swollen feet persisted. China and Arnica  solved this last \nmalady, yet the last entry of this case stated \u201cshe was entirely relieved\u201d.85  \n                                                             \n83 An interesting case is the use of Plantago  for intermittent fevers. Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s Family Guide  \nrecommended Ipecac  or Nux vom  for this malady, yet Madero chose Plantago , for in the same manual \nthis homeopathic remedy was recommend ed specially for people who grew vegetables in low and humid \nlands. Gonz\u00e1lez, Tratado pr\u00e1ctico de homeopat\u00eda y gu\u00eda de las familias   172, 244 -9. \n84 Madero\u2019s clinical booklet in ASHCP, FHFIM, 63, 71.  \n85 Madero\u2019s clinical booklet in ASHCP, FHFIM, 41,47,53.  54 \n These clinical cases show that Madero was a committed homeopathic practitioner. He \nconstantly tried to ascertain his patients \u2019 outcome, which he learned by letter or spoken word, \nand modified his prescription accordingly. He reported only a few cases \u2014 like the one in the \nintroduction of the chapter  \u2014 in which the patient was apparently left with no ailment at all, but \nonly one where the patient died. No case report includes regime indications such as diet or \nexercise. It seems that he assumed that the homeopathic medicine or magnetism would do the \nwork, though generally homeopathic family guides instructed about the regi me patients should \nfollow, and his spiritualist letters indicate that he was aware of diet .86 It is difficult to assess the \nefficacy of homeopathic remedies with current medical knowledge, yet it is fair enough to say \nthat homeopathy provided some sort of h ealing for people who had limited access to professional \nphysicians. And for those who had access to them, such as Madero\u2019s family, it constituted a way \nto get rid of their pernicio us methods, for as Madero said \u201c allopaths do not have medicines for \nthis di sease, and with the syrups and other concoctions they provide, they hurt the patient\u2019s \nstomach, which in turn debilitates more and more the patient, making it difficult for him to \nheal.\u201d87 \nConclusions  \nDuring a time of liberal reforms in Mexico, homeopathy b ecame the medicine of the \npeople. Following the French E nlightenment, homeopaths aligned with academic physicians in \nmaking contemporary medical knowledge accessible to the literate public. But homeopaths\u2019 \nlanguage and commercial publicity undermined acade mic medicine\u2019s exclusivity by popularizing \nmedical knowledge. With a language and publicity that resonated with the cultural values and \nhealth needs of the literate population, homeopaths positioned their medical system as an \n                                                             \n86 Madero, Cuadernos esp\u00edritas, 1900 -1908   87. \n87 Letter to Sr. Don Gregorio D. Zambrano on 17 February 1904. Madero, Epistolario (1900 -1909)   69. 55 \n alternative therapy that patie nts preferred over other traditional methods . They also placed \nhomeopaths\u2019 services in competition with the ones provided by academic physicians. Moreover, \nhomeopathy provided healing services to patients who were unable to afford or unwilling to use \nthe services of regular physicians and was sometimes used by patients to provide healing \nservices to others. In this sense , homeopathy became a medical commodity not only consumed \nby the people, but also prescribed by the people.  \nBeing for the people did not a ctually mean that all the population had immediate access \nto homeopathy. O nly literate citizens were able to purchase homeopathic kits and manuals, read \nthem, and practice homeopathy. In this sense, homeopathy was still a medical knowledge for \nelites, thou gh homeopaths popularized it as medical knowledge outside professional c ircles. \nIlliterate members of the working class had access to homeopathic therapy through charitable \nefforts of practitioners such as Gonz\u00e1lez and Madero. This meant that only literate  individuals \ncould actually become homeopathic practitioners and that the rest of the population who \nconsumed homeopathy remained as patients without the possibility to become practitioners. The \nliberal medical project that homeopathy represented was still  for elites in a country where 75% \nof the population was illiterate88.  \nYet homeopathy\u2019s popular appeal contributed to its success as a medical commodity \nduring the second half of the nineteenth century in Mexico. Homeopathy\u2019s commonsensical \ndisease explana tions and its theory of disease based on vitalism aligned with people\u2019s own \nexperience of diseases, how they understood them, and how they related such popular notions of \ndisease with their own religious beliefs and moral lives, as Madero\u2019s personal life a nd clinical \nnotes suggest. This shared understanding of the body and disease was the one that allowed \npopular interest in homeopathy, whether as sellers or consumers, practitioners or patients, \n                                                             \n88 Lira and Staples, \"Del desastre a la reconstrucci\u00f3n republicana, 1848 -1876,\"   483.  56 \n regardless of class distinctions. Homeopathy\u2019s success as a me dical commodity was based on the \nability of homeopathic entrepreneurs to accommodate it to the needs of customers from different \nsocial groups. While homeopathic entrepreneurs addressed urban educated audiences\u2019 interest in \nmodern scientific medical commod ities, they also addressed the urban working class highlighting \nhomeopathy\u2019s gentle remedies and unexpected and surprising healings. They appealed to rural \nelites offering ways to cope with the lack of physicians in the countryside.  \nHomeopathy\u2019s disruptio n of the traditional doctor -patient relationship produced different \nreactions in urban and rural settings. In Mexico City, where the higher doctor -patient ratio \nresulted in a stiffer competition for patients, regular medical practitioners complained about \nhomeopaths\u2019 ability to attract and retain customers through inaccurate explanations of diseases. \nIn such a scenario, regular practitioners accused homeopathic domestic manuals and \nhomeopathic consultation as detrimental to the patient. Yet in rural setting s that lacked trained \nphysicians, hacendados  prized the possibility that homeopathy gave them to provide healing \nservices on the road, to their families and to their workers, either personally or through mail. \nHomeopaths competed with physicians in the urban medical marketplace, yet their first -aid kits \nand manuals provided hacendados with a resource to provide medical relief in the rural \nlandscape. While a close doctor -patient relationship communication accounted for homeopathy\u2019s \nsuccess in the c ity, the possibility to turn any literate individual into a practitioner who could \nprescribe even by means of a third party or by letter resulted in homeopathy\u2019s success in the \ncountryside.  \nWhether in the countryside or in the city, homeopathic domestic ma nuals did not shift \npeople\u2019s understanding of disease and healing. In a free medical market, these manuals sought to \ngain the acceptance of the public and consequently accommodated homeopathy to popular 57 \n understandings of the body and its modifications, reg ardless of class and cultural distinctions. \nMadero\u2019s clinical notes evidence how he and his patients regarded disease in humoral terms and \nused homeopathic manuals as remedy finders. But because of the symptomatic nature of \nhomeopathic therapy, remedy find ing became a way by which homeopathy personalized \ntherapeutic interventions as symptoms changed and gave material evidence to reassure patients\u2019 \nbelief in their disease progress rather than increasing their concern about it. This connection \nbetween patient s\u2019 beliefs and practitioners\u2019 approach resulted in patients\u2019 choosing homeopaths \nrather than other physicians.  \nHomeopaths a dapted their medical system to the cultural and economic liberal practices \nthat characterized the Mexic an society in the second half  of the nineteenth  century. Homeopathy \nas a medical doctrine also fit the intellectual tastes and therapeutic needs of a stratified Mexican \nsociety. Such flexibility allowed homeopathy to penetrate different sections within the Mexican \npopulation and becom e one of the preferred therapeutic commodities of the people, whether by \nchoice or by need.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 58 \n Chapter 2.  The \u201cMedical Reform\u201d: Professional Organization, Medical Science, and \nScientific Governance in the Formation of the Homeopathic Profession, 1869 \u201395 \nOn July 15, 1893, President Porfirio D\u00edaz, Minister of the Interior, Manuel Romero \nRubio, and the governor of the Federal District, General Pedro Rinc\u00f3n Gallardo, gathered in the \ngardens of El Polvor\u00edn  \u2014 a military facility located in the southern outskirts of Mexico City \noriginally intended to function as an asylum for patients with typhus \u2014 to inaugurate the \nNational Homeopathic Hospital . Homeopathic doctors Ignacio M. Monta\u00f1o and Joaqu\u00edn Segura \ny Pesado talked to the audience about the origins and development of homeopathy in Mexi co \nduring the last four decades  and about the therapeutic principles on which ho meopathy was \ngrounded. Finally Juan de Dios Peza, an acclaimed poet at the time, entertained those who \nattended the event. The journalist wrapped up his report with a note that praised the government \nfor \u201cacknowledging homeopathy and opening the regular fi elds of battle to it.\u201d1  \nThe creation and government sponsorship of the homeopathic hospital might appear \nsurprising and against all odds, considering that homeopathy had been introduced as a medical \ncommodity for domestic use and that academic physicians considered it a way to \u201cspeculate\u201d \nwith health. Yet the elements that made such an outcome possible are depicted in the \ninauguration itself. Rather than homeopathic entrepreneurs such as Comellas and Gonz\u00e1lez, \nacademically trained doctors who endorsed home opathy were the ones responsible for running \nthe new hospital. This signals an important change in the configuration of the homeopathic \ncommunity, a change that better fit the effort to turn this group into a modern medical profession. \nDr. Monta\u00f1o\u2019s discou rse precisely explained such a change, recognizing Comellas and Gonz\u00e1lez \n                                                             \n1 \"El Hospital Homeop\u00e1tico, \" El siglo diez y nueve  julio 17 1893.  59 \n as introducers and strong supporters of homeopathy yet emphasizing that the \u201cmodern school \nwas sustained by intelligent and practicing physicians\u201d .2  \nHomeopathic physicians gave homeopathy a different look to that given by their \nentrepreneurial counterparts. Rather than picturing it as a form of domestic medicine or as an \nunbeatable yet gentle therapeutic tool, physicians highlighted its positivistic nature. Dr. Segura y \nPesado\u2019s discourse during the inauguration underlined the \u201cdeterminism\u201d on which the \nhomeopathic me thodological approach was based  and how \u201cexperimentation and observation\u201d \nled homeopaths to characterize life and disease in terms of \u201csensible phenomena\u201d or in other  \nwords \u201cfacts\u201d .3 The parallel of this explanation to the Comtean positivistic philosophy is no \ncoincidence. In a time when Gabino Barreda and other reformers used this philosophy as a tool \nto culturally transform Mexican society, homeopathic physicians ado pted it to advance their \nposition as a professional group.  \nJournalists regarded the hospital\u2019s creation as a way to solve epistemological and social \ndisputes between the groups that contested homeopathy\u2019s legitimacy. The medical community \nwas divided in i ts opinions about homeopathy. Within academically trained physicians, there \nwere those who believed that homeopathy contradicted the foundations of medical science, but \nthere were other group who considered that it either contradicted the foundations of me dical \nscience, or lacked enough  evidence to proof its workings. Within the community of homeopaths, \nacademically trained physicians practiced homeopathy as a scientific therapy and a growing \ncommunit of lay homeopathic practitioners profited from selling h omeopathic manuals and \nmedicines, offered homeopathy as a form of domestic medicina, or both. For a government that \naimed to rule under the most advanced scientific dictums to achieve economic progress, such as \n                                                             \n2 \"La inauguraci\u00f3n del Hospital Homeop\u00e1tico,\" El siglo diez y nueve  Jueves 20 de julio 1893.  \n3 \"La inauguraci\u00f3n del Hospital Homeop\u00e1tico.\"  60 \n D\u00edaz\u2019s, this dispute could only be solved in equal conditions that warranted fair competition. \nClinical outcomes of state hospitals decided on homeopathy\u2019s effectiveness which in turn \ninfluenced D\u00edaz\u2019s government in regularizing and funding a homeopathic school that aimed to \nsolve the problem of home opathic charlatanism.  Consequently, t he creation of the homeopathic \nhospital positioned homeopathic physicians\u2019 practice and institutions vis-\u00e0-vis th e ones of the \nregular medical profession .  \nIn this chapter I will analyze the construction of the homeopat hic profession in Mexico \nduring the second half of the 19th century. I will follow the structure suggested in the previous \nparagraphs to show that by adopting homeopathy, some academic physicians introduced it into \nthe dynamics of medical professionalizati on in Mexico City. Such introduction meant that in \norder to cope with medical regulations and professional unifying tendencies, homeopathic \nphysicians recognized state medical schools such as the National School of Medicine and the \nSuperior Board of Health  as centers of professional authority in matters of medical training and \nlicensing. Furthermore, these physicians adopted the rhetoric of positivistic science to position \nhomeopathy as a scientific therapy over other therapies. In turn, homeopathic physici ans \nregarded entrepreneurial approaches to and the liberal practice of homeopathy as unprofessional  \nand separated their activities and institutions from those who endorsed them. Eventually, the \ndivision of the homeopathic community paid off in terms of pro fessional recognition. A \ngovernment that sought to modernize the nation through education and science such as Porfirio \nD\u00edaz\u2019s saw the opportunity to train a growing population of homeopathic practitioners in modern \nscientific homeopathic therapeutics using  the properly trained homeopathic physicians in a \nhomeopathic hospital and school funded by the federal state. A \u201cmedical reform\u201d turned the \n\u201cmedicine for the people\u201d into a medical profession.  61 \n The medical profession in the first half of the 19th century in Mexico  \nWhen Comellas introduced homeopathy to the Mexican people around midcentury (see \nChapter 1), academic physicians had just taken the first steps to turn medicine into a modern \nprofession. The reforms of President and also physician Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas in 1833 turned \ncolonial medical institutions (whose regulating control l ay in the Spanish crown and the Catholic \nChurch ) into liberal ones, regulated by civilian laws .4 But with the disputes between federalists \nand republicans before 1850 and betwee n liberals and conservatives from 1850 to 1870, there \nwere few spaces for institutional construction during almost four decades. The School of Medical \nSciences took turns with the National and Pontificate University of Mexico to train physicians \nduring thi s hectic period, until the former turned into the Escuela Nacional de Medicina \n[National School of Medicine] in 1854. The school retained this designation for the rest of the \ncentury, indicating a definite emancipation from the control of the Catholic Church. The \nSuperior Board of Health started to control medical practice in 1833 by  creating a medical \nregistry, a list of physicians whom the Board authorized to practice in Mexico City. The \nauthority of the board did not go beyond Mexico City and consequently these regulations were \nnot always followed, let alone implemented, by local juntas sanitarias [sanitary boards] . \nSomething similar happened with the medical degree obtained at the medical school, for while \nsocial elites relied on it as a symbol of status, people consumed health services from a vast \npopulation of untrained and unlic ensed practitioners.  \nThe practical absence of trained physicians and their distribution in the national territory \ncontributed to a poor professional organization. Indian towns relied on traditional healers or \n                                                             \n4 See Jose \u00c1lvarez Am\u00e9zquita, Miguel E. Bustamante and Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez del Castillo, Historia de la \nsalubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico , vol. I, 2 vols. (Mexico, D.

Mexico City had the \nlargest concentration of licensed practitioners \u2014 including physicians, surgeons, pharmacists , \nand phlebotomists  \u2014 in contrast to the countryside, yet illegal practitioners outnu mbered regular \npractitioners. For instance, only 17 out of 37 physicians that the census of Mexico City 1811 \u201312 \nregistered were included in the medical registry of the city (about 1.81 per 10,000 inhabitants) .7 \nThough statistics are taken from a limited nu mber of districts, they indicate an overall tendency \nin the nature of medical providers available to Mexico City\u2019s population at the beginning of the \nwars of independence. It is possible, then, to speculate that even in urban centers such as this, \nmedical care from academic physicians was scant. Perhaps it was even more dramatic. Though \nacademic physicians were obliged by law to provide medical consultations at specific hours of \nthe day for free to the poor, they mostly offered their services to wealthy eli tes. Things slightly \n                                                             \n5 Most of the local medical traditions relied on herbal remedies, thou gh explanations of disease etiologies \nand therapeutic effects were deeply influenced by their religious understanding of the natural world and \nhuman nature.

In 1865, this branch separated from the commission and became the \nMedical Society of Mexico, and started to publish the medical journal, Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9x ico, which \nis still the Academy\u2019s official publication. In 1873, this medical society was renamed as the National \nAcademy of Medicine. Though other versions trace the academy\u2019s origin to a society created on \nNovember 30, 1851.

But during the second half of the 19th century, the competition between the \ngrowing population of trained physicians in Mexico City and the abundant population of \nirregular practitioners made the former seek state support15 and start a discrediting campaign to \nrule out other healing practices .16 The homeopathic community organized as a professional \ngroup amidst this transition, adopting and adapting the strategies followed by academic \nphysicians, eventually keeping homeopathy as a distinct medical profession.  \nHomeopath\u2019s \u201cReforma M\u00e9dica\u201d: From D omestic Healers and Medical Entrepreneurs to \nHomeopathic Physicians  \nJust like their academic counterparts, homeopaths populated the urban landscape, \nparticularly amidst wealthy families, and their entrepreneurial activities targeted at least initially \nan audience well positioned in socioeconomic and geographic terms. Both were trying to find a \nsocial and professional place in the new structures that the modern nation was struggling to build \nup. Academic physicians sought in state institutions the support th ey needed to consolidate as a \nprofessional group, while homeopaths found the space to consolidate in the emergent liberal \nmarketplace. As I have analyzed in the previous chapter, Ram\u00f3n Comellas and other homeopaths \npopularized the use of homeopathy amidst Mexican elites. Consumers of homeopathy eventually \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nLetras, Direcci\u00f3n General de  Asuntos del Personal Acad\u00e9mico, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de \nM\u00e9xico, 2005).  \n14 Members of the Academy believed that it was the role of the state to provide health services to the poor. \nSee for instance Ana Mar\u00eda Carrillo, \"M\u00e9dicos del M\u00e9xico decimon\u00f3ni co: entre el control estatal y la \nautonom\u00eda profesional,\" Dynamis  22 (2002): 353 -57. \n15 For a larger discussion about the relationship between Mexican physicians and the state see Carrillo, \n\"M\u00e9dicos del M\u00e9xico decimon\u00f3nico: entre el control estatal y la aut onom\u00eda profesional.\"  \n16 See for instance, Carrillo, \"Profesiones sanitarias y lucha de poderes en el M\u00e9xico del siglo XIX.\" ; and \nAgostoni, \"M\u00e9dicos cient\u00edficos y m\u00e9dicos il\u00edcitos en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico durante el Porfiriato.\"  65 \n became homeopathic practitioners or entrepreneurs who used it as a means to commercialize \nhomeopathic products, medicines, and services, as in Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s case, or to procure \nmedical relief to their closer ones, as in Madero\u2019s case. This approach helped homeopaths to \nenlarge their networks with several lay practitioners, some entrepreneurs, and a few physicians \nand pharmacists .17 By the late 1850s there were around thirteen homeopaths practicing in \nMexico City  contrasted to 169 allopaths (Table 2) .  \nRam\u00f3n Comellas and other homeopaths also followed the trend their academic peers \nwere pursuing and started to organize the reduced group of homeopathic practitioners into \nprofessional societies. The first ho meopathic societies created in the mid -19th century were \nephemeral .18 They needed more than enthusiasm to endure and funding the activities and \njournals of these societies was an essential need that homeopathic practitioners could not afford. \nEventually, a patron came from one of Comella\u2019s patients, Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez. The role of Juli\u00e1n \nGonz\u00e1lez as a medical \u2014 but most importantly homeopathic  \u2014 entrepreneur was central for the \nsponsorship of the first enduring homeopathic societies in Mexico City. In the previ ous chapter \n                                                             \n17 Joaqu\u00edn Salas and the pharmac ist Nicol\u00e1s Tinoco y Mijares were also turned to homeopathic practice \nby Comellas. Comellas also gathered a small group of people to discuss the new system where he \nprobably met Rafael Degollado, a physician who practiced at Hospital San Pedro y San Pablo and who \nturned to practice of homeopathy as well in 1861.Other networks of homeopaths not initiated by Ram\u00f3n \nComellas started to populate the Mexican medical landscape of the 1850s. Rafael Navarrete, a Cuban \nphysician, arrived in Mexico City in 1853. One y ear later, Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3, a Catalonian homeopath who \narrived in Veracruz, treated successfully forty cases of yellow fever in that city, and just like Comellas, he \nreceived the authorization from President Santa Ana to practice homeopathy in Mexico. By 1857, Carb\u00f3 \noffered homeopathic medicines and medical advice in his own homeopathic dispensary in Mexico City. \nNarciso Sanchiz arrived in Mexico City in 1855. He is responsible of the conversion of Alfredo \nDom\u00ednguez Ugalde and Pablo Fuentes y Herrera.  Pascual B ielsa, and brothers Jos\u00e9 and Jaime Puig y \nMonmany arrived in Mexico City in 1856. Both brothers would start practicing homeopathy in the mid -\n1860s after Sanfeliu, a Spanish immigrant who arrived in 1865, converted them to the new system. \nHomeopathy attract ed members of Catholic institutions, such as the Dominican friar Manuel Aguas and \nthe Presbyterian Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez de Le\u00f3n who both started to practice homeopathy in 1857.  \n18 Ram\u00f3n Comellas founded the first homeopathic society in 1850 altogether with the pharma cists Nicol\u00e1s \nTinoco y Mijares. Pascual Bielsa, Pablo Fuentes y Herrera, Rafael Navarrete and Manuel Aguas, a \nnetwork of homeopaths independent from Comellas, formed the Sociedad Homeop\u00e1tica de M\u00e9xico in \n1861. This society published the medical journal La Gaceta . Both societies lasted no longer than a year.  66 \n we saw how homeopathic dispensaries and pharmacies started to populate the landscape of \nMexico City during the last years of the 1860s, and how particularly Gonz\u00e1lez used homeopathy \nto expand his own  business . He likely pursued the sponsorship and promotion of professional \nhomeopathic societies in order to rule out his competitors .19 It was his and not others\u2019 \nhomeopathic entrepreneurial approaches that were the target of critiques from academic \nphysicians in the early 1870s, suggesting not only the profitability of the connection between \nentrepreneurship and professional societies, but the discomfort this produced amongst academic \nphysicians.  \nThrough Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s sponsorship, homeopaths organized the Instituto \nHomeop\u00e1tico Mexicano [Mexican Homeopathic Institute, IHM] in 1869, the first enduring \nhomeopathic society. The building where Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s dispensary was established provided the \nIHM with a room for the society\u2019s meetings  and a consulting office where Institute\u2019s members \nprovided free he alth services and medicines. Gonz\u00e1lez paid for the publication of El Propagador \nHomep\u00e1tico , the academic journal of the recently created institute .20 The new society gathered \nsixteen homeopaths, both physicians and practitioners, including the sponsor .21  \nThis homeopathic institute appeared at the same time that the Medical Society of Mexico \nwas forming, and consequently these two medical societies emerged as two competing medical \n                                                             \n19 His dispensary is mentioned in connection with his support to homeopathy and the IHM; see \"Consultas \nm\u00e9dicas,\" El ferrocarril  Martes 16 de noviembre 1869.  \n20 For the activities that Gonz\u00e1lez sponsored see the first numbers of El propagador homeop\u00e1tico. For his \nsponsorship of the consulting office and the homeopathic journal see the newspaper ads published in El \nSiglo Diez y Nueve and reprinted in the homeopath ic journal, \"El propagador homeop\u00e1tico,\" El \npropagador homeop\u00e1tico  1.2 (1870). ; and \"Botica homeop\u00e1tica,\" El propagador homeop\u00e1tico  1.2 (1870).  \n21 The founding members were Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, Jos\u00e9 Puig y Monmany, Francisco P\u00e9rez y Ortiz, \nTranquilinio Hidalgo,  Pablo Fuentes y Herrera, Rafael Navarrete, Pascual Bielsa, Sari\u00f1ana, Pomposo \nPati\u00f1o, Sanfeli\u00fa, Hay, Ruiz D\u00e1vila, Barona, F.

The \nSociety sponsored the same activities as the Institute, but having the National School of \nMedicine and state hospitals as centers of professional train ing, the Society had no need to \nestablish classes and a medical dispensary. In contrast, the Institute not only sponsored such \nactivities, but granted medical \u201cdiplomas\u201d to some of the members which in turn used them to \ncomply with regulations of medical p ractice that the Board of Health imposed .24 This situation \nturned the homeopathic institute into a professional society that competed not only with the \nSociety, but with the National School Medicine as a center of medical training and consequently \nof profes sional control.  \nThe academic and homeopathic community discussed this conflict in terms of the \ninstitutions that could legally grant medical degrees. For instance, in his article El m\u00e9dico en la \nsociedad , Jos\u00e9 Galindo accused Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez for disguisin g his profiting interests in the shade \nof \u201cmedical altruism\u201d and for using the possession of a title which was not issued by the National \nSchool of Medicine to turn medical practice into medical business . For Jos\u00e9 Galindo, \u201cthe \nprofessional liberty that th e Constitution  [of 1857] granted did not intend to turn professions into \n                                                             \n22 See Fernandez del Castillo, Historia de la Academia Nacional de Medicina de M\u00e9xico .; and Guarner, \n\"L'influence de la m\u00e9decine francaise sur la m\u00e9decine mexicaine aux XIXeme siecle.\"   \n23 See Francisco P\u00e9rez Ortiz and Pablo Fuentes y Herrera, \"REGLAMENTO del Instituto Homeop\u00e1tico \nMexicano,\" El propagador homeop\u00e1tico  1.6 (1871).  \n24 Juli\u00e1n Gon z\u00e1lez\u2019s dispensary was prosecuted by the Superior Sanitary Board in 1871. People who \nlacked a legal professional degree were banned from taking responsibility of pharmacies. Gonz\u00e1lez \neventually was able to retain the control of his dispensary, but through negotiations with the President and \nnot for possessing a medical degree. For a detailed account of this event see chapter 5.  68 \n a means of robbery\u201d, openly referring to Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez and his pharmacy.25 Galindo\u2019s critiques \nare an example of how academic physicians regarded the provision of medical training an d \ndegrees within homeopathic societies .26 Particularly, Galindo could not conceive the idea that \npeople like Gonz\u00e1lez, who did not pursue proper medical training at the National School of \nMedicine where contemporary breakthroughs in surgery, obstetrics, and  anatomic and \nphysiological pathology were taught, obtained a medical degree from a homeopathic society and \npresented themselves as true physicians.  \nSuch critiques and a new wave of government regulations that aimed to use medical \ndegrees issued by state medical schools as the basis of legal medical practice impacted the \norganization of the homeopathic institute and the composition of its members in the early 1870s. \nJuli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s pharmacy was caught amidst this wave of regulations. At the center of \nGonz\u00e1lez\u2019s conflict with the Federal District\u2019s government and the Superior Board of Health was \nhis lack of a legal medical degree .27 He d idn\u2019t have a degree from the National School of \nMedicine, yet he held a diploma from the homeopathic institute .28 With this  diploma, he aimed to \ncomply with regulations that the Sanitary Board imposed on people who owned and ran \npharmacies in Mexico City. Furthermore, he used the diploma and his influence within the \n                                                             \n25 Jos\u00e9 Galindo, \"El m\u00e9dico en la sociedad,\" El observador m\u00e9dico  II.17 (junio) (1873).  \n26 Galindo, \"La homeopat\u00eda.\"  \n27 Homeopathic physicians such as Pascual Bielsa, who also had a homeopathic pharmacy and who \npossessed a legal medical degree, did not face at least in the beginning the vicissitudes that Gonz\u00e1lez \nsuffered. For a detailed account of Bielsa\u2019s case see chapte r 5.  \n28 He is not included in the medical registry of 1871; see \u201cLista de los m\u00e9dicos, farmac\u00e9uticos, dentistas y \nparteras residentes en el Distrito Federal\u201d in AHSS, SP, EM, 3, 61. He recognized that the Institute \ngranted him a diploma. See Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1le z, \"Literatura m\u00e9dica y homeopat\u00eda,\" El propagador \nhomeop\u00e1tico  2.1 (1874).   69 \n Institute to change the Institute\u2019s regulations and attain ke y positions in the Institute\u2019s Directive \nBoard that originally only physicians with a regular medical degree could hold .29  \nGalindo\u2019s critiques, government institutions \u2019 actions against Gonz\u00e1lez, and the latter\u2019s \nreaction to the interventions of the Superior Board of Health motivated diverse responses from \nthe homeopathic community that mimicked the same distinction that academic physicians \nwanted to use to separate from homeopathic practitioners. For instance, Galindo\u2019s critiques \ngenerated different responses from homeopathic practitioners and physicians members of the \nIHM. Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez replied that a scientific society\u2019s diploma granted its holder the authority \nto promote that specific society\u2019s growth .30 Homeopathic physicians differed from this p osition \nand argued that homeopaths indeed needed an adequate medical training. Therefore they \nsuggested turning homeopathy into a legal practice by incorporating classes of homeopathy into \nmedical schools, as already happened in other parts of the world .31 While not directly critiquing \nGonz\u00e1lez\u2019s situation, homeopathic physicians were clear about their position regarding legal \ntraining and practice. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s self -promotion within the Institute motivated resignations from \n                                                             \n29 In 1869, Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez was elected treasurer of the IHM Board. His new position within the \nInstitute\u2019s government structure was possible only through a change in the Institute\u2019 s internal regulations, \nwhich for that year allowed that along with those physicians authorized to legally practice medicine, \n\u201cthose who obtained a certification from the institute that they had taken and passed examinations on all \nclasses that integrated the academic curricula of medical school\u201d could become first class members and \noccupy positions in the Board. See \"La junta directiva del instituto debe funcionar [...],\" El propagador \nhomeop\u00e1tico  I.4 (1871).  The new regulation was approved on March 6, 1871, just two days before \nGonz\u00e1lez\u2019s dispensary faced difficulties with the Superior Board of Health due to the dubious origin of \nGonz\u00e1lez\u2019s medical degree. The Board approved the new regulation of the IHM on th at date; see P\u00e9rez \nOrtiz and Fuentes y Herrera, \"REGLAMENTO del Instituto Homeop\u00e1tico Mexicano.\"  \n30 See Gonz\u00e1lez, \"Literatura m\u00e9dica y homeopat\u00eda.\"  \n31 The editors of the IHM\u2019s journal, Francisco P\u00e9rez y Ortiz, Pablo Fuentes Herrera, Jos\u00e9 Tranquilino \nHidalgo and Juan Pablo de los R\u00edos, gave the homeopathic physicians\u2019 perspective on Jos\u00e9 Galindo\u2019s \ncritiques, in Francisco P\u00e9rez Ortiz, Pablo Fuentes Herrera, Jos\u00e9 Tranquilino Hidalgo and Juan Pablo De \nlos R\u00edos, \"Atacados en los nums. 17 y 18 del Observador m\u00e9dico  [...],\" El propagador homeop\u00e1tico  II.7 \n(1873).  70 \n members who possessed legal degrees  and licenses, such as Jos\u00e9 Puig y Monmany, editor of the \nInstitute\u2019s journal at the time, and Pascual Bielsa .32  \nAs Bielsa\u2019s and Puig y Monmany\u2019s departure from the institute show, Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s  \nprofessional status and the nature of the IHM as an inst itution that granted medical degrees \nproduced tensions and divisions amongst institute\u2019s members. Such divide distinguished between \ntwo factions within the homeopathic community, homeopathic physicians and homeopathic \npractitioners, a divide that mimicked how academic physicians distinguished themselves from \nother healing practices , homeopathy included , in their effort to constitute a professional group. \nHomeopathic physicians were willing to be considered as members of the nascent medical \nprofession to the  extent that they abided by the criteria imposed by sanitary authorities and \nmedical elites as to what constituted a legal physician . Moreover, homeopathic physicians \nadopted the marginalizing discourse with which academic physicians addressed homeopathy a nd \nits practitioners  and used it against homeopaths who practiced on the margins of regular \nmedicine . As a consequence, homeopathic physicians promoted a division within the IHM.  \nWhy would members of the IHM who were also regular physicians be dubious abo ut \nhomeopath\u2019s training, if they were the ones who modified the institute\u2019s regulation that \nauthorized the organization of training courses and the granting of diplomas in the first place? \nHomeopathic physicians realized that the strategy to diffuse homeop athy initiated by Comellas in \nthe 1850s was out of fashion and that if they wanted to push homeopathy forward in Mexico in \nthe 1870s, it would not be enough to reproduce the social organization of academic physicians. \n                                                             \n32 Report given in an extraordinary reunion on April 9, 1871; see P\u00e9rez Ortiz, \"Discurso pronunciado por \nel se\u00f1or vicepresidente del Instituto.\"  For the list of authorized physicians of the Superior Sanitary B oard \nsee \u201cLista de m\u00e9dicos, farmac\u00e9uticos, dentistas y parteras, residents en el Distrito Federal\u201d, AHSS, SP, \nEM, 3, 61.  71 \n They needed to recognize the regulatio ns that ruled the professional life of physicians .33 On the \ncontrary, homeopathic practitioners argued that their right to practice homeopathy was granted in \nthe liberal Constitution of 1857 which gave them \u201c the right to teach  without any restriction that \nwhat might be appropriate [to them]; for where the law does not forbid, no one is allowed to \nproscribe\u201d .34 These fundamental professional divisions eventually materialized in a reform to the \nInstitute\u2019s internal regulations in 1875 that left all homeopaths who did not have a regular \nmedical degree out of the institutions.  \nThe IHM remained integrated by both professional and lay homeopaths from 1870  to \n1874, and its Board continued to be integrated by graduates of the National School of Medicine \nwho endorsed  homeopathy, or practitioners certified by the IHM, such as Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez. In \n1875, homeopathic physicians reformed the Institute to include only those with a legal medical \ndegree . In the new journal of the Institute, La Reforma M\u00e9dica  [The Medical Refor m], the Board \nclarified that the new regulation had two objectives : first, to constitute the Institute as a scientific \nsociety that gave voice to homeopathy within the medical profession and attracted more \nphysicians w ith a legal degree to its ranks,  and s econd , to avoid crit iques to the Institute for \n\u201cgranting the degree of profesores  [professionals], without any right to do so, to people who , \nwithout any consider ation of how learned or wise they were , had not adequately and legally \nprovided proof of their  medical knowledge.\u201d35 Through this action, the Institute complie d with \nprofessional regulations  and aimed to gain the acceptance of other homeopathic physicians, \n                                                             \n33 For such a position see the opinion of Jos\u00e9 Alberto Salinas y Rivera, who became member of the IHM \nin 1875, in Jos\u00e9 Salinas y Rivera, \"REMITIDO,\" La Iberia  S\u00e1bado 14 de agosto 1875.   \n34 The newly created Medical -Homeopathic Mexican Society presented its arguments in \"REMITIDO,\" \nLa Iberia  Martes 24 de agosto 1875. ; and \"La Sociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1tica Mexicana,\" El ec o de \nambos mundos  August 31 1875.  \n35 \"Advertencia,\" La reforma m\u00e9dica  I.1 (1875): 3 -4.  72 \n indicated by the re -incorporation of Jos\u00e9 Puig y Monmany into the institute and incorporation of \nnew members, all of them regular physicians .36  \nNevertheless, the professional image of homeopathy was not repaired , and the Institute \nwas not accepted as a professional medical society in Mexico City during the 1870s. Medical \nsocieties such as the Natio nal Academy of Medicine, the Pedro Escobedo Medical Association, \nand the Larrey Association stopped exchanging their journals with the IHM, at least during the \nfirst years of the decade .37 Any public support of homeopathy by professors within the National \nSchool of Medicine caused heated reactions from homeopaths, students in the National School of \nMedicine , and the public press .38  \n                                                             \n36 Other important doctors in the other urban centers in Mexico who integrated to the new Institute were \nFrancisco Marchena (Puebla), Jos\u00e9 Alberto Salinas y Rivera (Tenancingo), Sanfeli\u00fa (Veracruz), Luis \nZaragoza and Pl\u00e1cido Diaz (Puebla, 1877), Mariano Omed es de Viela (Mexico City, 1879), Ismael \nTalavera (Orizaba, 1879), and Macario Romero (Yautepec, 1879).

Later  on, when the \nacademy\u2019s attitude towards homeopathy turned more receptive, it started to exchange the IHM\u2019s journal; \nsee the Acts of the academic sessions on January 16, 1878, February 20, 1878 and June 5, 1878, in Gaceta \nM\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico  XIV.14 (July 15, 1879). Later on the academy would even exchange foreign \nhomeopathic journals, for instance in 1881 it started receiving Archivos de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica  from \nBarcelona, Spain; \"ACADEMIA DE MEDICINA. Sesi\u00f3n del 3 de enero de 1881. Acta num . 14 aprobada \nel 12 del mismo,\" Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico  XVI.7 (abril 1) (1881): 25.  \n38 Such as in the case of Adri\u00e1n Segura, a professor of pathology who in catedra  requested his students to \nexperiment with highly diluted doses. The national press either pr aised Dr. Segura as a defender of \nhomeopathy or as a traitor to scientific medicine, depending on the position that the newspaper took in \nthis conflict. Juan Pablo de los R\u00edos, a journalist and ardent homeopathic practitioner, praised Adri\u00e1n \nSegura as a de fender of homeopathy, in Juan Pablo de los R\u00edos, \"Una carta del Dr. Segura. - \nComentarios,\" El Monitor Republicano  Mi\u00e9rcoles 25 de abril 1877.  Some newspapers from M\u00e9xico City, \nsuch as El Combate, La Patria, and La Orquesta , published commentaries in the same terms as Juan \nPablo de los R\u00edos, and even one of them suggested Segura\u2019s resignation from his position of Professor of \nPathology at the National School of Medicine. But Adri\u00e1n Segura addressed the National Academy of 73 \n Regardless of blocking the IHM\u2019s incorporation into the professional life of medical \nsocieties in Mexico City, the IHM\u2019s strateg y of professionalization paid off in other parts of the \ncountry, gaining spaces where they could legally offer homeopathic training. Homeopathic \nphysicians obtained teaching positions at the School of Medicine of Puebla in 187839 and opened \nspaces for clini cal practice in th at city and in Veracruz in 1879 .40 That year, Puebla\u2019s new law of \npublic instruction regulated medical education, incorporating homeopathy as a medical degree, \nindependent from that of regular medicine, and organizing the academic curricul a for the \nhomeopathic degree .41 Governor Luis Mier y Teran regularized homeopathic practice in \nVeracruz in 1880 .42 Hence, the \u201cmedical reform\u201d carried out by the homeopathic institute \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nMedicine justifying his action. He explained that he was not a homeopath and that he made a favor to \nhomeopaths in believing in the accuracy of the homeopathic doctrine and in attempting experiments to \nsee if homeopathic theories were true.

See \"La Escuela de Medicina de Puebla,\" La reforma m\u00e9dica  II.8 (enero) (1878). ; \nand \"CR\u00d3NICA M\u00c9DICA.

Zaragoza held the position of Professor of Homeopathic Therapeutics and was in charge of the \nClinic of Homeopathy in the General Hospital in Puebla. Dr. Ismael Talavera promoted the opening of \ntwo wards, one for men with 17 beds and one for women with 8 beds, destined to homeopathic treatment \nin the Hospital \u201cLa Llave\u201d in Orizaba, Veracruz. See \"Inauguraci\u00f3n de dos salas de homeopat\u00eda en el \nHospital de Orizaba,\" La reforma m\u00e9dica. Segunda \u00e9poca  IV.8 (25 de septiembre) (1880).  \n41 Students of homeopat hy had to attend almost the same courses as allopaths, except Mineralogy and \nGeology, Pharmacy, Anatomic Pathology, and History of Medicine, which would be substituted by Clinic \nof internal homeopathic medicine, and Allopathic and Homeopathic Therapeutics;  homeopathic students \nhad also to perform \u201creasoned homeopathic experiences\u201d. The courses that allopaths needed to course \nwere Botany, Zoology, Mineralogy and Geology, Chemistry, Chemical Analysis, Anatomy, Histology, \nTopographical Anatomy, Anatomical Path ology, Pharmacy, Physiology, Internal Pathology, External \nPathology, Clinic of Internal Medicine, Clinic of External Medicine, Pathology of Infants, General \nPathology, Surgery, Therapeutics, Hygiene, Obstetrics, Clinic of Obstetrics, Legal Medicine and \nToxicology, and History of Medicine and Surgery. Even pharmacists needed to course homeopathic \npharmacy as part of their professional training. See Francisco de As\u00eds Flores y Troncoso, \"Ense\u00f1anza de \nla medicina en el per\u00edodo positivo,\" Historia de la medicina  en M\u00e9xico desde la \u00e9poca de los indios hasta \nla presente , vol. 3 (M\u00e9xico: Oficina tipogr\u00e1fica de la Secretar\u00eda de Fomento, 1886) 204 -06. \n42 In order to become a legal homeopathic practitioner in this state, homeopaths needed to certify that they \nhad studie d medicine as required by contemporary laws. Besides this requirement, they needed to pass \nexaminations on \u201cI. Applied botany with a special emphasis on the geography of medicinal plants of the \ncountry. II. Reasoned exposition of the Hahnemannian medical d octrine. III. Homeopathic therapeutics. 74 \n allowed homeopathic physicians to institutionalize homeopathy within official medical \ninstitutions in some states, but not in Mexico City.  \nThe position taken by the reformed IHM in 1875 reconfigured the path to becom ing a \nprofessional homeopath. An aspir ing homeopathic physician needed to study medicine at any of \nthe offici ally recognized medical schools, then learn homeopathy by reading homeopathic books \nor practicing along with a homeopathic physician or practitioner, and finally obtain a \nhomeopathic degree from the state of Veracruz. Otherwise that person needed to study \nhomeopathy in the School of Medicine of Puebla. Homeopathic practitioners believed that they \ndid not need to go through this entire pathway to become homeopaths, and consequently when \nthe IHM was reformed in 1875, they formed a homeopathic society of their  own in 1874, the \nSociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1tica Mexicana  [Medical -Homeopathic Mexican Society]. The \nDirective Board of this new society was integrated by practitioners who were not included in the \nlist of authorized physicians issued by the Superior Board of  Health in 1871. The society \npublished an academic journal, El faro homeop\u00e1tico  and opened a consulting office, just as the \nreformed IHM did. But in contrast to the latter, the society of homeopathic practitioners opened a \nschool to train new homeopaths .43 Homeopathic practitioners were not able to secure any \nauthorization by government or academic institutions, as opposed to their professional peers . 44  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nIV. Homeopathic clinics.\u201d The decree detailed the procedures for such examinations and clarified that \nwhile there were no professional homeopaths with title in Veracruz, the government would integrate the \nexamining c ommittee with three professors of surgery and medicine who were members of the IHM. See \nthe decree no. 105 in \"CR\u00d3NICA DE LA HOMEOPAT\u00cdA. Reconocimiento y protecci\u00f3n de la \nhomeopat\u00eda en el Estado de Veracruz,\" La reforma m\u00e9dica. Segunda \u00e9poca  IV.1 (1880).   \n43 See \"La Sociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1tica Mexicana.\"   \n44 For instance, Jos\u00e9 Salinas y Rivera was able to obtain a position of physician in a local prison, and \nCrescencio Col\u00edn participated in the oppositions for a position in one of the welfare hospitals in Mex ico \nCity; see note in J. Alberto Salinas y Rivera, \"CR\u00d3NICA de las oposiciones para proveer las plazas de \nm\u00e9dicos de los establecimientos municipales de M\u00e9xico,\" La reforma m\u00e9dica  II.6 (1877). ; and \n\"OPOSICIONES,\" Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico  XII.6 (15 de marzo)  (1877).  Following the example of the \nfirst homeopaths in Mexico, this homeopathic society sought to obtain authorization to practice \nhomeopathy directly from local authorities. On July 1878, Manuel Vald\u00e9s y Morelos, the Society\u2019s 75 \n  During the 1870s, homeopaths sought to incorporate the ir activities into the ordered \u2014 \nor in other words , legal  \u2014 national life. Both homeopathic physicians and practitioners detached \nfrom homeopathic entrepreneurial activities. Neither of the reformed professional societies, for \ninstance, included Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez amongst its members. Yet the community of ph ysicians, \nhomeopathic ones included, located the medical degree issued by the National School of \nMedicine as the junction that kept the profession together and that regulated officia l medical \ninstitutions . During this period, physicians whether homeopaths or not reacted against any \nattempt to disrupt such central unif ication . On the opposite side, practitioners unsuccessfully \nsought a venue to be accepted as regular physicians. If homeopathy was a therapeutic system that \nhealed people even in the hands of t hose who did not have a legal medical degree, its practice \ncould not be illegal, practitioners argued. This appreciation of homeopaths\u2019 clinical successes \nstarted a battle of credibility among homeopathic practitioners, homeopathic physicians, \nmembers of t he National Academy of Medicine, pharmacists, and students and graduates from \nthe National School of Medicine. These battles aimed to promote or discredit homeopathy, \nsublimate or derogate it, make it appear as either common or scientific knowledge, or use  its \ntenets as a heuristic tool to find new medicines.  \nPositivism, Medical Science, and the Plurality of Scientific Homeopathic Therapeutics  \nThe construction of homeopathy as the opposite of scientific positivistic medicine, a \npractice of ignorant people, a heuristic pharmacological tool, the true scientific therapeutic \nmethod, or a miracle cure mirrored at small scale larger socio -economic, political , and cultural \nchanges in Mexican society during the second half of the 19th century. Homeopathy was not \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \npresident, requested auth orization for him and all the members of the academic society he represented to \nissue death certificates, but with no success. To see a detail account of this event see chapter 5; \n\"CR\u00d3NICA M\u00c9DICA. Acuerdo sobre una solicitud de la Sociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1ti ca Mexicana,\" \nGaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico  XIII.24 (21 de agosto) (1878).  76 \n intrinsically alternative or heterodox in nature to medical science, and the multiple contemporary \ndepictions of it say more about the socio -political context within which the framers of such \ndepictions lived in than about the ontology of homeopathy itself .45 During the 1870s, while \nhomeopaths organized into professional societies following the example of other medical \nsocieties of the time, and while the discussion about the value of an official medical degree for a \nprofessional practice and inclusion in offic ial life was taking place, there was a discussion about \nthe epistemological status of homeopathy and the epistemological value of the clinical facts to \nwhich homeopaths turned to validate homeopathy\u2019s effectiveness. These discussions took place \nonly after homeopathy established a wide public practice in Mexico City, but most importantly \nwhen positivistic science became a tool of social reconstruction.  \nThe process of the professionalization of medicine \u2014 and homeopathy  \u2014 in Mexico \ncame at a time of peace tha t promised economic and cultural progress in Mexico .46 After Benito \nJu\u00e1rez finally defeated his competitors to make the liberal Constitution  of 1857 prevail, he \nestablished a government that gave the nati on a sense of stability (1867 \u201372). With his victory \ncame along necessary regulations to implement the Constitution ; new civilian and penal codes \nthat ruled in the Federal District and other federal territories were issued and soon other states \nfollowed this example. What I have just described as the reorgani zation of homeopathic societies \nso they would only accept physicians with legal medical degrees was just but one example of \nsuch tendency.  \nBut stability would not be achieved only through legal and institutional transformations. \nAn ideological transformat ion was also necessary. The importance of positivism for the \nconsolidation of the triumphant liberalism lies precisely in that it was used as a reconciliatory \n                                                             \n45 For an elaboration of this idea see Cooter, \"Alternative Medicine, Alternative Cosmology.\"  \n46 For a general assessment of this period see Lira and Staples, \"Del desastre a la reconstrucci\u00f3n \nrepublicana, 1848 -1876.\"  77 \n ideology that promised social reconstruction .47 When Gabino Barreda publicly read his Oraci\u00f3n \nC\u00edvica [Civic preach] in 1867,  he proposed to create a new ordered and progressive nation by \nteaching Mexican children how to think  methodologically. Inductive science was to be the \nfoundation of any empirical knowledge, keeping theology, metaphysics and philo sophical \nspeculation apart, and brin ging the nation into a superior \u2014 positive, in Comtean words \u2014 stage. \nSuch a pedagogical approach permeated the Mexican society in the following decades, thanks to \nBarreda\u2019s efforts as Minister of Instruction to create t he National Preparatory School, where \nstudents willing to pursue professional education absorbed Comtean positivism. For him , new \ngenerations needed a structured mentality in order to promote progress. They needed to learn \nfrom particular facts to general laws, from what is concrete to what is abstract, through \nobservation and experimentation, gathering positive facts from experience. Science, modernity , \nand progress were intertwined, and eventually materialized in projects that improved social and \nmaterial  conditions of the most important urban center in the nation, Mexico City .48  \nBarreda started promoting his positivistic ideology within the medical sciences even \nbefore his Oraci\u00f3n c\u00edvica  and more importantly in the context of a critique of homeopathy. In \n1861, he published La homeopat\u00eda, o juicio cr\u00edtico sobre este nuevo medio para enga\u00f1ar a los \nc\u00e1ndidos  [Homeopathy, or critical appraisal about this new means to deceive na\u00efve people] .49 \n                                                             \n47 See Hale, The Transformation of Liberalism in Late Nineteenth -Century Mexico .

See Gabino \nBarreda, Op\u00fasculos, discusiones y disc ursos coleccionados y publicados por la Sociedad Metod\u00f3fila \nGabino Barreda  (M\u00e9xico: Imprenta del Comercio, de Dubl\u00e1n y Ch\u00e1vez, 1877) i.  78 \n This work was so influential that throughout the second half of the 19th century and the first half \nof the 20th century it would guide academic physicians\u2019 appraisal of homeopathy, as in the case \nof Galindo\u2019s critiques .50 Barreda\u2019s concern with homeopathy was that it diffused medical \nknowledge among the general public, an audi ence that was not properly educated to judge \nmedical matters. He recognized that professional physicians knew about homeopathy; they had \nan obligation to do so since that was their profession. But since midcentury, the wide diffusion of \nhomeopathy in the M exican population generated comparisons between homeopathy and \n\u201ccommon medicine\u201d amidst untrained people. Barreda considered that \u201cthe people\u201d who talked \nabout homeopathy lacked rational data to judge the new medical system because they were \n\u201cignorant\u201d abo ut medicine in the first place.  \nBarreda believed that each one had to decide on the wellbeing of himself and his family, \nbut as the leading man of positivism in Mexico that he would become in the next years, he \nbelieved that it was necessary to \u201cil lustrat e\u201d people so they could m ake more informed decisions. \nOnce he took this step, the tone of his book turned into a denunciation of ignorance. He believed \nthat \u201cthere was no other way to effectively combat charlatanism, but with the diffusion of \nlights\u201d .51 As in the Oraci\u00f3n c\u00edvica , Barreda placed science and its diffusion through education as \nthe one and only solution that would truly and thoroughly eliminate what he called the hydra, \nreferring to charlatanism. He put charlatanism, ignorance, and \u201cvague and incomplete notions\u201d in \none single box, and contrasted them with truth and education. For the positivist , the diffusion of \nhomeopathy among the Mexican public was a consequence of its ignorance, and the only way to \n                                                             \n50 Barreda\u2019s critique of homeopathy went through several reprints with a different name in Revista \nPositiva , Barreda, \"La  homeopat\u00eda o juicio cr\u00edtico sobre este nuevo sistema.\"  Then the Cr\u00f3nica M\u00e9dica  \nreprinted it in several numbers of the volume 7 in 1904. Finally, it was printed in 1934 as a monograph, \nby \u201cAcci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica\u201d, the medical journal of the Sindicato de M\u00e9dicos Cir ujanos del Distrito Federal \n[Union of Physicians from the Federal District].  \n51 Barreda, \"Op\u00fasculos, discusiones y discursos,\"   1 -2. 79 \n stop ignorance \u2014 or the diffusion of homeo pathy, in that case  \u2014 was through education. The \nrest of the pamphlet was precisely that, an instruction o n how to think about homeopathy in \nterms of a charlatanry that deceived illiterate and untrained people . \nIn the early 1870s, the decade academic physi cians started using Barreda\u2019s rhetoric and \nmethodology. In order to discredit dispensaries\u2019, patients\u2019 , and practitioners\u2019 accounts about \nsurprising and unexpected results achieved with homeopathy, academic physicians used \n\u201cexperience\u201d, the ultimate tool t o decide epistemic conflicts according to Auguste Comte\u2019s \npositive methodology, without noticing that experience was also at stake. While for homeopaths \nexperience referred to the clinical outcomes of those patients who had been treated with \nhomeopathic me dications ,52 academic physicians referred to how to understand disease and its \ncauses in the body. A critique of homeopathy in 1871 read  \nThe philosophical thinking of our time is pure observation. Bodies at the reach of \nour hands and conditions where chang es in these bodies take place: That is \nscience. There is no place in it for anything that has not been seen and touched. \nMay anyone who believes in this [science] pay attention to animism, dynamism, \nvitalism and other preconceived hypothesis? Back up react ionary homeopathy! \nHail to the school of Paris!53  \n \nThis understanding drew a boundary between professional and amateur practice of medicine. \nOnly those who had access to positivistic science \u2014 in other words, those with a privileged \naccess to professional medical training  \u2014 could grasp such an understanding of medical science \nand practice. These medical elites discredited all other forms of medical knowledge , particularly \n                                                             \n52 It was homeopathic practitioners who most commonly used this argument, though previous \nhomeopathic physicians such as Ra m\u00f3n Comellas and Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3 obtained authorizations to practice \nhomeopathy on the grounds their success in epidemic outbreaks using homeopathy. In the 1870s the \nMexican Medical -Homeopathic Society would recurrently used this argument. Alberto G. Bianchi wa s \nthe one who particularly responded to homeopathic critiques, arguing that homeopathy proved more \neffective in hospital statistics; see Alberto G. Bianchi, \"Al \"Progreso\",\" El Ferrocarril  Mi\u00e9rcoles 21 de \njunio 1871.   \n53 Alberto G. Bianchi was responding to the critique published in El Progreso ; see \"Al Ferrocarril,\" El \nFerrocarril  Martes 30 de mayo 1871.   80 \n those proposed by curanderos , midwives, homeopaths, and nostrum sellers, practitioners  who \nacademic physicians labeled as charlatans. In the logic of academic physicians , these charlatans \nwere guilty of malpractice due to their lack of scientific knowledge .54 \nEven the Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico , the National Academy\u2019s of Medicine\u2019s journal, \nwhich originally did not intend to side on any medical discussion in 1865 ,55 started to publish \ncritiques of  homeopathic practice and therapeutics after homeopathic physicians professionalized \nthe homeopathic institute in 1871. These critiques were not as cent ered on homeopathy as a \nmedical system as Jos\u00e9 Galindo\u2019s; rather they were reflections on clinical cases that included \nnegative comments about homeopathy. Yet these comments pinpointed similar critical issues for \nacademic physicians regarding homeopathic p ractice, such as homeopath\u2019s lack of medical and \nsurgical knowledge, the practice of homeopathy just for profit, and the absence of any medical \nsubstance in homeopathic globules. Demetrio Mej\u00eda and Juan Fenelon were the most eager \ncritics of homeopathic pr actice and therapeutics in the 1870s in the Gaceta .56 Mej\u00eda catalogued \nhomeopaths amongst charlatans and included its therapeutic successes within those cases where \nthe patient healed due to the natural course of disease or in the absence of any therapeutic  \nintervention .57 Homeopathy to him was simply no therapeutics at all. If homeopaths coincided \n                                                             \n54 Claudia Agostoni describes this boundary as the logic behind the distinction between scientific \nphysicians and ileg al physicians; see Agostoni, \"M\u00e9dicos cient\u00edficos y m\u00e9dicos il\u00edcitos en la ciudad de \nM\u00e9xico durante el Porfiriato.\"  \n55 See Ehrmann and Jim\u00e9nez, \"Prospecto,\" Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico  I-II.1 (15 de septiembre) (1864).  \n56 I analyzed one of Fenelon\u2019s critiques in  chapter 1. There was another one where he detailed all the \nanatomical findings he made in a newborn who had developed liquid inside his skull, and all therapeutic \ninterventions Fenelon did to reduce the baby\u2019s brain swelling. Fenelon guided the reader to what he \nbelieved was the single anatomical cause of the child\u2019s death, the contusion of the head. It did not matter \nthat the immediate cause of death was diarrhea and that the physician mentioned in his report that the \nbaby\u2019s family lived in extremely unhy gienic conditions, Juan Fenelon accused a homeopath for \u201chaving \nused forceps without any dilution\u201d during the child\u2019s birth. See Fenelon, \"CIRUG\u00cdA PR\u00c1CTICA. Carta \ndel se\u00f1or Fenelon sobre varios puntos de cirug\u00eda,\" Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico  IX.17 (1 de septiembre) \n(1864): 317.   \n57 As Fenelon\u2019s critiques, lack of knowledge or unsounding basis of homeopathy were the reasons why \nDemetrio Mej\u00eda labeled homeopaths as cause of death or useless for healing or at least palliation. See 81 \n with other physicians\u2019 diagnosis and advised surgery, Fenelon accused them for not sustaining \ntheir faith in homeopathy or for a dapting  their practice to the socioeconomic status of the patient; \n\u201cthe profit was not worth the risk of wasting patient\u2019s time, as they are used to do\u201d, he said .58 \nFenelon did not agree with the idea that the cause of a particular disease would be the specific \ntreatment for that same disease \u2014 in other words the idea of simila similibus curantur , likes cure \nthe like \u2014 and he provided anatomical examples, as when he criticized tracheotomy to remove \nan object from a patient\u2019s trachea . According to him, tracheotomy w as a surgical practice worth \nof a homeopath, for it was \u201cadding a strange body to an intolerant organ which already had a \nstrange body within it.\u201d59 \nHomeopathic physicians saw the need of the homeopathic community to catch up with \nthe cultural demands impos ed by positivism and medical science. They realized that by \ncontinuing to emphasiz e the ability of every person to learn homeopathy, they weakened \nhomeopaths\u2019 ability to be recognized as legitimate medical practitioners. No matter their ties to \nthe regular  medical profession, by popularizing homeopathy as the medicine for the people \nhomeopaths built an image of popular medicine that conflicted with their professional \naspirations. For this reason, they internalized the scientific rhetoric and incorporated it  into their \nprofessional community, reshaping their own discourse. Homeopaths turned homeopathy into a \nscientific therapeutic system, based on clinical observations and facts, rather than anecdotes of \nmiraculous healings. Homeopathic physicians, hence, pic tured homeopathy as a \u201cmedical \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nDemetrio Mej\u00eda,  \"Fractura extensa de la boveda y base del cr\u00e1neo,\" Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico  IX.13 (1 \nde julio) (1874): 237. ; Demetrio Mej\u00eda, \"ACADEMIA DE MEDICINA.

The \u201cmedical reform\u201d was truly positivistic therapeutics for \nthem.  \nThe reformation of the hom eopathic institute in 1875 not only kept professional \ncredentials as a membership requirement, but also introduced a discursive shift in the way \nhomeopathic physicians diffused homeopathy. Homeopathic practitioners responded to Jos\u00e9 \nGalindo\u2019s critiques by opposing homeopathy to pathologic anatomy and traditional therapeutics. \nFor instance, Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez argued that allopaths \u2014 for him, those who practiced the \u201cofficial \nschool\u2019s\u201d therapeutics  \u2014 were not able to localize pneumonia in a single organ, and tha t even \nassuming this specific localization , their therapies harmed other organs, reducing the body\u2019s \nnatural self -recovery tendencies such when they used blood -letting , or producing new diseases \nsuch as when they used surgery . He blamed these methods as \u201ch ypothesis and nothing else; \ntheories lacking any foundations; respect for a systematic and fanciful tradition; no \nexperimentation; these are the great resources of the traditional school\u201d. And he continued,  \nIs it proper to dismiss fair observations [refer ring to those made by homeopathic \npractitioners], persisting in doing harm, cultivating the mistake, and turning into \nstrong advocate s of doctrines that are far from being scientific? This is where \nallopaths dwell and yet they call us assassins and charlat ans.60  \n \nGraduates of the National School of Medicine who adopted homeopathy and joined  to the \nIHM subscribed to the thesis that homeopathy was scientific therapeutics, yet they were not \noppos ed to the traditional therapeutics offered by \u201cthe official school\u201d. In response to Jos\u00e9 \nGalindo\u2019s critiques of homeopathy, the reformed IHM argued that the scientific locus of \nhomeopathy was its notion of pure experimentation and its foundational law of sim ilitude, the \nsimilia similibus curantur . It was only through this law that therapeutics became scientific, the \n                                                             \n60 Gonz\u00e1lez, \"La homeopat\u00eda,\" 239.  83 \n editors of the IHM\u2019s journal argued .61 This position allowed them to be less dogmatic about the \nprinciples of homeopathy, which consequently made them more cautious about the general \napplicability of the homeopathic law and some of its implications .62 For instance, Jos\u00e9 Alberto \nSalinas y Rivera believed that homeopathy supplemented \u201cofficial therapeutics\u201d and \nconsequently believed that homeopathy was  more a therapeutic method than a medical system .63 \nAccording to him, allopathy lacked the individualization of each patient\u2019s disease impli cit in the \nhomeopathic approach;  consequently homeopathy demanded more detailed clinical observations \ncontrasted to t he clinical practice taught by allopaths. Rigorous clinical observation and rigorous \npharmaceutical experimentation \u2014 in other words , detailed application of the principles of pure \nexperimentation and the law of similitude  \u2014 made homeopathy a positive scie nce in Salinas y \nRivera\u2019s analysis.  \nThere were some divergences amongst homeopathic physicians. While Salinas y Rivera \nbelieved that the exact coincidence of the patient\u2019s individual symptoms with the specific \nsymptoms produced by a particular homeopathic  remedy determined the homeopathic doctor\u2019s \nprescription, Francisco Marchena, another graduate of the National School of Medicine who \njoined the IHM in 1875, believed that the election of the right medication should be based on the \npatient\u2019s general sympto ms.64 Both agreed that it was necessary to use infinitesimal or highly \n                                                             \n61 Francisco P\u00e9rez Ortiz and Tranquilinio Hidalgo, both registered in the Superior Board of Health were \nthe editors of the journal of the IHM. They suscribed this opini\u00f3n in an editorial article of the Institute\u2019s \njournal; see \"Similia Similibus Curantur,\" El propagador homeop\u00e1tico  III.1-2 (1874).   \n62 Other graduates from this school such as Crescencio Col\u00edn persistently sustained homeopathy\u2019s \nexceptionality, aligning with the dogmatic rhetoric of homeopathic practitioners; see below in this \nchapter. For the position of the professional society founded  by homeopathic practitioners see \"Nueva \ncruzada,\" El faro homeop\u00e1tico   (1874).   \n63 See Salinas y Rivera, \"DIAGN\u00d3STICO EN HOMEOPAT\u00cdA.

Adri\u00e1n Segura , professor of Pathology at the \nNational School of Medicine , carried out some experiments with homeopathy and even \nprompted his students to test the infinitesimal doses of this therapeutic system in 1877 . His \npioneering position regarding homeopathy is evid ence of a generational shift regarding \ntherapeutics within the Academy. Instead of relying on what previous physicians, scholars or \ntextbooks said about specific therapeutic approaches, what at the time was called empirical \ntherapeutics, he proposed to act ually carry out experiments to se e if those approaches worked in \nclinical practice. When Segura addressed the Academy, he emphasized that he only asked \nstudents to \u201cpersonally learn from the field of what is experimental\u201d, as he had done it for \u201cthree \nyears without reaching a definite opinion about homeopathy\u201d.65 He was clear about his disbelief \nin the theoretical foundations of homeopathy, yet he acknowledged that its law was \nrecommended in clinical practice for it had proved to have good results. Regardles s of public \ndenunciations that with no success demanded him to resign from his position at the school of \nmedicine, Segura continued experimenting with homeopathy and acknowledging its \ncontributions to the national pharmacopeia.66 By the first half of the 18 80s, Adri\u00e1n Segura was \n                                                             \n65 Segura, \"CR\u00d3NICA M\u00c9DICA. Carta del Sr. Dr. Adri\u00e1n Segura.\"  \n66 In 1882, he continued prescribing treatments recommended by homeopaths in the Hospital Ju\u00e1rez  and \nreporting his successful results to the Gaceta;  see \"ACADEMIA DE MEDICINA. Extracto del acta de la \nsesi\u00f3n del 16 de noviembre de 1881. Acta no. 7 aprobada el 20 de noviembre,\" Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico  \nXVII.1 (1 de enero) (1882): 10.  He acknowledged tha t homeopaths introduced the use of phosphorous for \nthe treatment of homeopathy, and that the medicine sulphur  was effective against diphtheria because of its \nhomeopathicity. He argued that this substance produced the ulcerations similar to those caused by the \ndisease itself. For his report on phosphorus see \"ACADEMIA DE MEDICINA. Sesi\u00f3n del 1o de mayo de 85 \n not neutral about homeopathy as other authors in the Gaceta , he was positive about the \nimportance of homeopathic contributions in both new drugs to treat disease and theoretical \nexplanations of the physiological effect of such drugs.  Moreover, he was confident to discuss it \nwith members of the Academy, which suggests a more open attitude of the Academy to \nintroduce homeopathy in their discussion of clinical cases.  \nAfter twenty years of critiques, members of the National Academy of Med icine started to \nacknowledge the therapeutic value of homeopathy, even in the hands of those who were \n\u201coutcasts\u201d of professional or academic medicine .67 This attitude shift also permeated the \nNational School of Medicine,  where students evolved from trying to explain \u201cthe parallel \nbetween rational medicine and homeopathy\u201d, as the title of Facundo Ramos y Ramos\u2019 1872 \ndissertation read, to evaluate \u201cwhat type of healing method should homeopathy adopt, dosimetry \nor allopathy?\u201d, as Arturo Palmero Alcocer\u2019s 1895 dissertation title asked .68 Students from the \nearly 1870s were not the same of those of the 1880s. Chemistry started to have an academic \nspace in the school of medicine. With the educational reforms of 1867, the new academic \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n1882.

When Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Puig y Monmany died in 1877 the Gaceta \nM\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico openly stated that \u201cprofessors of the academy did not endorse such a system.\u201d When \nthe journal announced that Francisco P\u00e9rez Ortiz had passed away in 1884, the note only mentioned that \nhe was a homeopath. When Crescencio Col\u00edn died in 1889, the journal on ly clarified that he was not \nmember of the Academy.

He probably wrote this dissertation to fulfill the \nrequirement to practice medicine in Mexico. The title dissertation clearly explained its content and \nsuggested its conclusions \u2013that the homeopathic  approach did some contributions to medicine, though it \nalso carried some problems with it.

Rather th ey considered it as part of the therapies available for any physician, and being \ntrained in chemistry, they were concerned about the doses it used.  \nChemistry provided new tools for pharmacists and physicians to understand the structure \nof old drugs and med ical formulations. It also provided new insights for thinking about \nhomeopathy. Chemically oriented physicians and pharmacists\u2019 appreciations of homeopathy \nwere not monolithic. On one side were those who believed, like the pharmacist Francisco Pati\u00f1o, \nthat mathematical and chemical analysis provided evidence that homeopathic dilutions did not \ncontain any trace of medical substance .70 Adri\u00e1n de Garay, a medical student in 1881 , followed \nall the instructions included in Hahnemann\u2019s Organon  to prepare a homeopa thic medication and \nthen subjected himself to the homeopathic regime of foods and beverages .71 He finally ingested \nthe medication without experiencing any of the effects attributed to the specific substance he was \n                                                             \n69 See Francisco de As\u00eds Flores y Troncoso, \"Establecimiento de Ciencias Medicas. - Escuela Nacional de \nMedicina.

Hilario \nS. Gavilondo in the newspaper La Rep\u00fablica  where he placed homeopaths as an example of the liberty of \nprofessions that Mexicans enjoyed in the early 1880s; see Francisco Pati\u00f1o, \"La libertad de profesiones,\" \nLa independencia m\u00e9dica  I.36 (1881).  The motivation to start the discussion suggests, as I have \nemphasized, that scientific discussions about homeopathy were rooted in the dispute for more patients as \nthe marketplace became more competitive in the last quarter of the 19th century. For his critiques of \nhomeopathic dilutions see Francisco Pati\u00f1o, \"La homeopat\u00eda,\" La independencia m\u00e9dica  I.38 (1881). ; and \nFrancisco Pati\u00f1o, \"Estudios sobre la homeopat\u00eda.

He graduated  of medicine in 1887. Around 1910, he was professor of \nTopographic Anatomy in the ENM. For his critique to homeopathy see Adri\u00e1n de Garay, \"La doctrina de \nHahnemann refutada por el Sr. Col\u00edn,\" La independencia m\u00e9dica  I.44 (1881).   87 \n ingesting. Pati\u00f1o and De Garay even challen ged Crescencio Col\u00edn, the homeopath with whom \nthey were having a discussion about the content of homeopathic doses, to a public experiment, a \nsituation that Colin rejected because he believed that Pati\u00f1o and De Garay missed the \nfundamental points of homeop athy and homeopathic pure experimentation .72 This discussion \nabout actual effectiveness with highly diluted doses continued throughout the rest of the 19th \ncentury .73 \nOn the other side were those pharmacologists interested in finding either new medical \nsubst ances or new applications for already known medicines. Fernando Altamirano, one of the \nmost important pharmacists in the last quarter of the 19th century who dedicated his life to \ninvestigate the medical properties of the national flora and fauna and who w ould played a key \nrole in the research program initiated at the Natio nal Medical Institute, an institution created \n                                                             \n72 When the \u201cSociedad Metodofila Gabino Barreda\u201d and authors -both pharmacists and physicians - of the \nrecently created journal La Independencia M\u00e9dica  critiqued homeopathy, Crescencio Col\u00edn was the single \nhomeopathic physician who debated with them. In these  debates, Col\u00edn pointed out that his adversaries \nmissed the point of the law of similitude and pure experimentation, and that doses were not essential to \nthe discussion of what homeopathicity was and how it worked. But as discussions progressed and his \nadversaries demanded experimental proof that diluted doses had a physiological effect in the human body, \nCol\u00edn responses turned dogmatic, emphasizing that homeopathy was the single therapeutic method that \nwas scientific, and that there was no other method, wh ether chemical, physiological, used in animals or \ndiseased humans but the homeopathic one that proofed the effect of homeopathic medicines. Col\u00edn was \nnot willing to accept partial proofs of homeopathy\u2019s effectiveness and he demanded a neutral public space \nfor such experiments. The society was created in 1877. Between 1877 and 1878, the journal reprinted \nGabino Barreda\u2019s critique of homeopathy and another critique by Daniel Mu\u00f1oz, one of Barreda\u2019s \ndisciples.

For Fernando Malanco see Fernando Malanco, \"La homeopat\u00eda ante la raz\u00f3n,\" \nLa reforma m\u00e9dica. Segunda \u00e9poca  III.9-11 (1888).  For Maximino R\u00edo de la Loza\u2019s position see below. \nPhysicians that formerly argued against homeopathy such as Juan Fenelon continued to oppose \nhomeopathy. He did not even acknowledge the value of homeopathy when his peer membe rs of the \nacademy, physicians and pharmacologists, started to acknowledge the value of homeopathy at the bedside \nand in pharmacological research in the mid -1880s. See J. Fenelon, \"TERAP\u00c9UTICA. Consideraciones \npr\u00e1cticas m\u00e9dico -quir\u00fargicas,\" Gaceta M\u00e9dica de  M\u00e9xico  XXIII.2 (15 de enero) (1888): 25 and 28.   88 \n during the Porfiriato solely for this purpose , was aware of the substances used by homeopaths .74 \nHis contribution to the Academy suggests that  homeopath s\u2019 frequent use of poison ivy motivated \nhim to look for the plant\u2019s pharmacological properties and promote its use among members of \nthe Academy. In the review of animal -produced poisonous substances presented by Jes\u00fas \nS\u00e1nchez to the Academy in 18 92, he commented that homeopaths used a large diversity  of \nanimal poisons as medicines  and concluded by quoting a famous French treatise of therapeutics; \n\u201cthe homeopathic doctrine has created a pure materia medica  from which all kinds of invaluable \nnotions about the special properties of medicines and about a multitude of particularities about \ntheir action which were not know amongst us are taken\u201d .75 Pharmacologist s\u2019 interest in finding \nnew therapeutic substances ma de them less concerned about homeopathic concentrations and \nmore interested in the homeopathic pharmacopoeia and its applications.  \nHomeopathy was nothing like a marginal practice in Mexico City at the end of the 19th \ncentury. The intellectual environment o f the last quarter of the 19th century favorably positioned \nhomeopathy as a scientific therapeutic system that competed with others that were in vogue at \nthe time. From domestic medicine practiced by patients who lacked any technical training in \nmedicine i n the 1850s, homeopathy had become a therapeutic system worth considering by \ntrained physicians and pharmacologists. The widespread use of this therapy amongst not only \npatients but also scholars, whether physicians, veterinarians, and pharmacists, made it  a sought -\n                                                             \n74 When he reviewed national plants that had irritant properties in 1880 for the Gaceta , he recognized that \nhomeopaths were the ones who most frequently used poison ivy [ mala mujer ]. Moreover, this plant was  \nthe same one that Madero sent to Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez de Lara to research its homeopathic properties. See \nFernando Altamirano, \"MATERIA M\u00c9DICA. Apuntes para el estudio de los medicamentos irritantes \nind\u00edgenas,\" Gaceta M\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico  XV.24 (15 de diciembre)  (1880): 510.  \n75 The authors of this Treatise of Therapeutics were Trousseau and Pidoux, authors to which homeopaths \nconstantly referred to in their discussions with academic physicians to proof that the latter\u2019s peers had \nalready experimented with homeopat hy and found it valuable. See Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez, \"HISTORIA \nNATURAL M\u00c9DICA. Nota relativa \u00e1 los virus, venenosos \u00f3 ponzo\u00f1as, de algunos animales que viven en \nM\u00e9xico. 2a. parte.

In ot her words, in a map of 19th century medical knowledge, academic physicians and \nprofessional pharmacists located homeopathy on the periphery as an accessory tool with which \nthey could gain knowledge about new therapeutic substances. This chart of medical kn owledge \nwas a mirror image of the professional space that homeopaths occupied in the last quarter of the \n19th century. Just a few graduates from the National School of Medicine practiced homeopathy \nand organized into professional societies. They were criti cal about some approaches of what they \ncalled \u201ctraditional\u201d medicine at the medical school, but they had no influence to promote a \nchange. Moreover, even geographically, the homeopathic school in Puebla and regulated medical \ndegrees in Veracruz were not lo cated in the epicenter of modernity that Mexico City was at the \nend of the 19th century.  \nUnable to find a more central position in academic discussions, within the National \nSchool of Medicine, and in other medical institutions, homeopathic physicians resu med former \nstrategies to diffuse homeopathy, particularly the provision of medical training and free health \nservices. The conjunction of these strategies with a scientific rhetoric helped homeopaths to \nconvince Porfirio D\u00edaz and his minister of the interio r to support a homeopathic hospital where \nclinical results decided homeopathy\u2019s therapeutic efficacy. As I will show in the next section, \nthis was achieved thanks to the context that homeopaths themselves had created : a reconfigured 90 \n homeopathic community integrated now by  both professional physicians who possessed \nknowledge of medical science and entrepreneurial practitioners who needed to be trained in \nmedicine, and the public acceptance of homeopathy as a scientific therapy.  \nPorfirio D\u00edaz\u2019s Scientific Gov ernance and the Creation of the National Homeopathic Hospital  \nIn 1884, Porfirio D\u00edaz was elected President of Mexico. His thirty -years -long dictatorship \ntransformed M\u00e9xico from a politically divided and economically devastated nation into one \nwhere \u201corder and progress\u201d, as his political campaign boasted, dominated. Following the advice \nof Los Cient\u00edficos [The Scientists], a group of elite politicians and men of profound influence , \nmost of who m grew up in Mexico City adopting Barreda\u2019s positivist philosophy, Mexico City \nbecame the epitome of an ordered and progressive city, particularly in term s of the medical \nsciences. As Mexican historian Claudia Agostoni shows, D\u00edaz\u2019s government sought to transform \nthe nation\u2019s capital into a cleaner and healthier city .76 This interest manifested in the creation of \ninstitutions that aimed to promote pharmaceut ical, microbiological, and pathological research77. \nSuch interest also extended to new therapies that promised to treat epidemic diseases, including \n                                                             \n76 See her Agostoni, Monuments of Progress: Modernization and Public Health in Mexico City, 1876 -\n1910 . \n77 The institutes were the Instituto M\u00e9dico Nacional , the Instituto Bacteriol\u00f3gtico Nacional , and the \nInstituto Patol\u00f3gico Nacional , respectively.

They resulted from homeopathic physicians\u2019 demands. They took advantage of \nseveral trends in D\u00edaz\u2019s govern ment:  the need for regulation of professions through the creation \nof state -funded professional schools; the status of homeopathy as a modern scientific therapy in \nneed for an ultimate experiment to certify its effectiveness; and the government\u2019s need to co pe \nwith the high rates of mortality in Mexico City \u2014 one of the clearest indicators of the lack of \nprogress in Mexico  \u2014 which translated into the provision of health services through welfare \ninstitutions. D\u00edaz\u2019s creation of homeopathic institutions and, he nce, his regulation of the \nhomeopathic profession in Mexico took the form of a social experiment, one which both \nhomeopathic practitioners and physicians had been requesting . In order to try the efficacy of \nhomeopathy as a therapeutic tool, he first author ized the creation of the homeopathic hospital; \nand after receiving  favorable results, he decided to authorize the creation of the homeopathic \nschool.  \nIn the 1880s, homeopathic institutions suffered a new transformation that put \nhomeopathic physicians and practitioners back together again, reviving homeopaths\u2019 arguments \nabout the liberal practice of homeopathy. In spite of the Mexican Homeopathic Institute\u2019s \nreorganization in 1875 and the recognition of homeopathy\u2019s contributions to medical science, it \nwas not able to gain public spaces for the study and practice of homeopathy in Mexico City in \nthe 1880s. The IHM\u2019s inability to enroll more physicians made its members to seek support from \n                                                             \n78 For instance, in 1887,  the Diario Oficial de la Naci\u00f3n  published the homeopathic treatment for cholera \nbecause it proved to be more effective than regular therapies.

In 1888, J oaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado, a recent convert to \nhomeopathy, one of the founding members of the new IHM, and a graduate from the National \nSchool of Medicine in 1877, opened a medical academy as part of the IHM efforts to propagate \nhomeopathy. He believed that a  homeopathic school was necessary for \u201cit was better to train \neducated professors who would brilliantly represent and willingly diffuse Hahnemann\u2019s science, \nthan to expect the fortuitous adoption of it by physicians.\u201d80 The new generation of homeopathic \nphysicians realized that the dreams of a previous generation to become part of the medical \nprofession by acknowledging official institutions as centers of pr ofessional control did not work  \nand that they needed to create their own means to make the homeopathic  profession grow and \nendure, based on the professional liberties that the Constitution granted.  \n                                                             \n79 The IHM grouped around 15 homeopaths in 1869. By 1873, it had approximately 30 members. The \nreformed IHM was left with only five homeopathic physicians in 1875. A rough calculation suggests that \ninitially, the society that grouped homeopathic practitioner s had at least five times more members than the \nIHM. Only a 10 physicians adopted homeopathy and became members of the IHM from 1875 to 1880. \nDuring the 1880s, the IHM lost institutional presence and Crescencio Col\u00edn remained as the single \nhomeopathic phys icians who debated with other physicians who critiqued homeopathy. In 1885, he \nreorganized former members from both homeopathic societies into a single one; the C\u00edrculo Homeop\u00e1tico \nMexicano  changed its name to IHM one year later, for the law of Veracruz re cognized members of this \ninstitution as legal homeopaths. See\u201dAve F\u00e9nix\u201d, La reforma m\u00e9dica. Segunda \u00e9poca  I.11 (julio) (1886) \nquoted in Francois Flores, Historia de la homeopat\u00eda en M\u00e9xico . For the new society, the distinction \nbetween physician and practitioner was no longer an obstacle to share an institutional life, as Juan N. \nArriaga, a member of the new society and homeopathic practitioner, put it \u201cthere is no way one can \nrequire from tho se who practice [homeopathy] to have a title provided by our authorities, and one must \nrely on the ones issued by foreign institutions or by the corporation that represents [this] medical system \nin our country\u201d. See La reforma m\u00e9dica. Segunda \u00e9poca  II.7 (1 887).  The new institution incorporated a \nlarger number of both former and new homeopaths than previous societies; there were 52 members \ndistributed in 20 cities in 1887.

Segunda \u00e9poca  III.7 (1888).  \n80 See \"La inauguraci\u00f3n del Hospital Homeop\u00e1tico.\"  93 \n The provision of free medical services was also a key element that distinguished the \npractice of physicians from that of practitioners. Members of the Academy b elieved it was the \nrole of the state to provide health services to the poor .81 The reformed IHM found it difficult to \nestablish free medical services after 1875, due to the lack of Gonzalez\u2019s sponsorship. Originally, \nits members needed to provide funds for the institute\u2019s new dispensary and their own medicines; \npatients in turn needed to pay medical consultation .82 In 1878, the institute opened the Casa de \nBeneficencia Mexicana  [Mexican Welfare House] to provide free public medical consultations \nand medicines , but it was closed a few months later because sponsors sold the property .83 \nMembers of the institute tried to open homeopathic hospitals that did not have any connection \nwith the IHM, but with no success .84 In 1888, the institute that put homeopathic physicians and \npractitioners back together again opened its dispensary as a means to \u201cincrease the public \nawareness of such a therapeutic system, to provide evidence of its clinical successes, and to \nfulfill phy sicians\u2019 duty as charitable men\u201d .85 Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez de Lara, a recent graduate of the \nNational School of Medicine  took charge of the new dispensary.  \nOnce again, the duality of the homeopathic community both as legal physicians and \nirregular practitioners  raised voices that clamored  for regulation. In a lecture given at the \n                                                             \n81 See for instance Carrillo, \"M\u00e9dicos del M\u00e9xico decimon\u00f3nico: entre el control estatal y la autonom\u00eda \nprofesional,\" 353-57. \n82 Arts. 3, 4 and 5 of the new \"REGLAMENTO,\" La reforma m\u00e9dica  I.1 (1875).   \n83 See \"Hospital homeop\u00e1tico,\" La reforma m\u00e9dica  III.7 (febrero) (1879). ; and Juan Arriaga, \"El Dr. \nCrescencio Col\u00edn,\" La reforma m\u00e9dica. Segunda \u00e9poca  IV.8 (agosto) (1889).  \n84 In 1874, Jos\u00e9 Puig y Monmany, an honorary member of the IHM, attempted to open a homeopathic \nhospital for which he required permission to the city\u2019s government. The Superior Board of Health to \nwhom the case was turned responded that a homeopathic hospita l could be set to work if it complied with \nthe hygienic requirements for a hospital, but the commission considered that Puig\u2019s hospital did not fulfill \nthe requirements of ventilation and consequently denied the authorization to Jose Puig.

Inauguraci\u00f3n del consultorio gratuito para \nlos pobres.\"   94 \n National Academy of Medicine in 1887, Maximino R\u00edo de la Loza, a famous pharmacist ,86 \nproposed to solve the problem of homeopathic charlatanism by both incorporating homeopathy \ninto allo pathy and teaching homeopathic classes in the National School of Medicine .87 He \nbelieved that by eliminating the dogmatism in both systems, disputes would end and every \npractitioner would find room to use any system for specific cases in their clinical prac tice. \nMoreover, he acknowledged that the only way to stop the diffusion of homeopathy as a domestic \nmedicine and the demand of homeopathic \u201chealers\u201d by patients in Mexico City was for the \nNational Academy of Medicine to promote the study of homeopathy in t he National School of \nMedicine. Only in that way, would homeopathic patients seek treatment with trained physicians \nrather than charlatans, he concluded.  \nFrancisco de As\u00eds Flores y Troncoso regarded homeopathy and the training of \nhomeopaths in a similar f ashion. He welcomed the training of homeopaths in the school of \nmedicine of Puebla .88 He even considered that through this approach the medical school of \nPuebla surpassed the ENM. But he also criticized the regulation in Veracruz, for it provided \nmedical de grees without even having a medical school. In Flores\u2019s opinion, regulation could \n                                                             \n86 Son of Leopoldo R\u00edo de la Loza. As his father, he played an important role in the institutionalization of \nchemistry, pharmacy and pharmacology in Mexico, as researcher, inventor, president of the \nPharmaceutical Society, and promoter of pharmacy as a profession independent from medicine during t he \nsecond half of the 19th century. See Liliana Schifter Aceves, \"La trayectoria cient\u00edfica de Maximino R\u00edo \nde la Loza como parte de la identidad de la Qu\u00edmica Mexicana,\" Bolet\u00edn de la Sociedad Qu\u00edmica \nMexicana  5.2-3 (2011).  \n87 He was confident that homeopa thy was not only useful to explain for instance new developed vaccines, \nbut also to foresee the application of new discovered alkaloids, as he himself did it when he competed for \na position of adjunct professor of chemistry in the ENM in 1861.

In admission thesis, he studied the uses of the plant \nSenecio canicida  where he explained how people used the plant to poison wolves and coyotes that lived \nin their villages, how extracted the alkaloid responsible for its effects, and how by using the law of \nsimilitude he deducted the medical uses of such substance. In clini cal experiments with dogs that received \na specific dose of this acid, he found that all of them suffered from convulsion. He concluded that the new \nsubstance could be used to treat epilepsy.

So while acknowledging that some trained \nphysicians adopted homeopathy, he severely criti cized untrained people who practiced it. \nMoreover, when he analyzed homeopathy as a medical system, he acknowledged it as a valuable \ntool because of its idea to carry out experiments in healthy individuals and its law of similitude .89 \nFor Flores y Troncoso, homeopaths needed to carry out further ex periments in order to \ndemonstrate that highly diluted doses had clinical effects. For such reasons he believed that the \nhomeopathic doctrine was \u201cworth as a subject of study and reasoning, even if it seemed singular \nand ineffective\u201d. \u201cIt was time \u2014 he conc luded  \u2014 to judge it based only on the purest and most \nreasoned experimentation and provide a definite verdict\u201d, about it as either \u201ca lie, or a true \nmedical progress. \u201d90 \nThe idea of carrying out an impartial experiment to test homeopathic doses drove medica l \nand pharmacological discussions in the early 1880s. But like many of Porfirio D\u00edaz\u2019s political \nand economic decisions during his dictatorship, his inclination for homeopathy was guided by \nhis own personal and political interests, rather than the benefit of the nation. While the press \nreported the creation of the National Homeopathic Hospital as a welfare effort that would also \nhelp to settle down the disputes between allopaths and homeopaths, the idea to support \nhomeopathy did not come from the group of p oliticians called los cientificos , among which \nfigured members of the National School of Medicie who were opend detractors of homeopathy, \nsuch as Porfirio Parra, close disciple of Gabino Barreda. Rather Diaz\u2019s inclination to \nhomeopathy came through Manuel Romero Rubio, his Minister of the  Interior in the early 1890s \nand father -in-law. Romero Rubio\u2019s close relationship to one of the wealthiest families in Mexico, \nthe Pesado family, and his inclination for homeopathy, facilitated Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado \u2019s \n                                                             \n89 See his chapter Flores y Troncoso, \"Terap\u00e9utica,\"   641 -9.  \n90 Flores y Troncoso, \"Terap\u00e9utica,\"   647 -8. 96 \n access to the President.91 D\u00edaz suffe red from a bone infection that no physician had been able to \ntreat successfully. When he learned  about Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado, he requested his services. \nUsing homeopathy, Segura y Pesado was able to make D\u00edaz\u2019s wound heal in 10 days .92 Whether \nthe story i s accurate or not, or if it only resembled clinical stories of success pictured by \nhomeopathic practitioners, Segura y Pesado\u2019s family connection with the President allowed the \nhomeopathic doctor to reach Porfirio D\u00edaz and obtain his support for homeopathy .  \nWhen Segura y Pesado addressed the Minster of the Interior to request support to open \nthe homeopathic hospital, he accommodated homeopathy into the trends I have described so far . \nHe argued that \u201cthose who subscribe [to the cause for the homeopathic hos pital] possess this \ntitle\u201d, and \u201cconsequently, we fulfill the requirements of the law to practice our profession.\u201d He \nbelieved that by establishing a hospital, the government would \u201cexpose the excellence of \nhomeopathic methods, contribute to solve the cala mities caused by epidemic diseases in Mexico \nCity, [\u2026 and] indicate that the administrations look[ed] after the general good through public \nwelfare.\u201d To substantiate his arguments, Segura y Pesado listed a series of statistics of European \nand US hospitals that showed the reduced mortality of patients treated with homeopathy during \nepidemic diseases. He only asked for material support and administrative staff to keep the \nfacility working, for the medical staff would provide their services free of charge.93 \n                                                             \n91 Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado was son of Guadalupe Pesado de Segura and Vicente Segura y Arg\u00fcelles. \nGuadalupe Pesado de Segura was daughter of the first matrimony of Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Pesado.

AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 1, 17 -21. 97 \n On July 1, 1893, Manuel Romero Rubio, Minister of the Interior, announced that Porfirio \nD\u00edaz had granted authorization to use El Polvor\u00edn  for the homeopathic hospital .94 In a few days \nmaterial resources and regulations were set, and the hospital started offer ing its services. The \nhospital was intended for poor patients with acute diseases who wanted to be treated by the \nhomeopathic method. For patients with chronic diseases, the hospital hosted an outpatient clinic. \nThe government paid for up to 60 patients in  the hospital and 14 staff personnel. F our \nhome opathic physicians \u2014 Joaqu\u00edn Segura Pesado, the hospital\u2019s head, Ignacio Mar\u00eda Monta\u00f1o, \nIgnacio Fern\u00e1ndez de Lara, and Fernando G\u00f3mez Su\u00e1rez  \u2014 offered their services, medicines, \nand medical and surgical instru mental free of charge, and medical personnel w ere subsequently \nincorporated from Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado\u2019s homeopathic school .95 As the journalist from El \nSiglo diez y nuevo argued when he reported  the inauguration of the hospital, the government had \nopened  the fields of regular battle to homeopathy, setting up a clinical experiment to decide the \neffectiveness of homeopathy in the clinic, as well as a social experiment that would decide the \nfuture of the homeopathic profession.  \nMedical statistics came out ev ery six months, showing the results of homeopathic \nintervention in acute diseases in the homeopathic hospital, and giving both homeopathic \nphysicians and Porifirio D\u00edaz the arguments they needed to regulate the homeopathic profession. \nThe hospital\u2019s staff and Porifirio D\u00edaz found the statistics outstanding. Mortality ranged between \n8.01 and  12.8%, in contrast to, for instance, 33% in Hospital Ju\u00e1rez .96 The homeopathic \n                                                             \n94 Correspondence from the Minister of the Interior to the Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado and other homeopaths, \nAHSS, EH, HNH, 1, 1, 23 \u2013 25. \n95 Correspondence between the Welfare Office of the Minister of the Interior and Joaqu\u00edn Segura y \nPesado, and \u201cReglamento de l Hospital Homeop\u00e1tico\u201d; AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 1, 26 -36 \n96 For the statistics of the homeopathic hospital see AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 1 p. 53; 1, 3, p. 2 -3; see also \nJuan Antiga Escobar, Consideraciones acerca de las estad\u00edsticas del Hospital Nacional Homeop\u00e1tico  \n(M\u00e9xico: Imp. de Trinidad S\u00e1nchez Santos, 1901) 11 -14.;  an article published by El Partido Liberal \nreprinted in \"Una defensa de la homeopat\u00eda,\" La medicina cient\u00edfica  VIII.22 -23 (1895).   98 \n hospital\u2019s staff argued that Porfirio D\u00edaz found the statistics of allopathic hospitals in such a stark \ncontrast to the homeopathic ones that he decided not to make the former publicly available . In \nthe eyes of the President, homeopathy succeeded in the clinical facts. In a time of scientific \ngovernance, of the dictatorship of facts, homeopathy proved its superiority over other treatments \nand earned a place in the official institutions of modern Mexico at the end of the 19th century.  \nYet homeopaths still needed to regulate their professional situation. Professors of the \nexisting homeopathic academy used the same argument that Barreda used to discredit \nhomeopathy, but this time a dapting it to support their petition. They used the argument that the \nregulation of homeopathic medical training would end up with homeopathic charlatanism in \norder to  convince President D\u00edaz to suppo rt a homeopathic medical school;  after all, the \nhomeopathic hospital had already prove the effectiveness of homeopathy and its status as a \nscientific practice. As homeopathic physicians did 20 years before to professionaliz e the IHM, \nthis new generation argued that most homeopaths who practiced in Mexico were not trained \nphysicians and that homeopathy was a \u201clegacy of charlatans\u201d. \u201cUnemployed, ignorant, and \nmisfortunate people, all of them open homeopathic consulting offices ; there is one on every \nstreet; even women open theirs and venture on with the beneficent science, greatly harming \npeople and homeopathy itself,\u201d they maintained.97 Porfirio D\u00edaz seconded this perspective. \nConsidering that Joaqu\u00edn Segura\u2019s homeopathic acade my already nourished the homeopathic \nhospital with homeopathic physicians, and that his school needed to provide \u201call the scientific \ncurriculum to its students in order to give plain certainties to patients who used this medical \nsystem and to preclude any abuses from practitioners who lacked any medical training and title\u201d, \nDiaz decided to constitute the profession of m \u00e9dico cirujano home\u00f3pata  [homeopathic medical \n                                                             \n97 See \"Una defensa de la homeopat\u00eda,\" 351.  99 \n doctor] .98 On August 17, 1895, he issued the decree that created such a profession and that \nregulated Joaqu\u00edn Segura\u2019s academy. This document provided the foundatio ns of  the academic \ncurriculum for students of this new profession, which were similar to those provided by the \nENM , plus dissection and homeopathic doctrine. Coursework done at the homeop athic academy \nwas considered legal , and the academy itself was declared \u201cnational\u201d ; in other words, the decree \ntransformed Joaqu\u00edn Segura\u2019s academy into the state\u2019s professional school for homeopaths, the \nEscuela Nacional de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica  [National School of Homeopathic Medicine]. \nProperly trained homeopaths would no longer b e charlatans and would instead become \nauthorized phy sicians.99 \nConclusions  \nThe regularization of the homeopathic profession can be seen as a symbol of state \npolicies during the Re stored Republic and the Porfiriato, rather than an actual form of regulating \nthe medical profession. Starting in the 1870s, the Mexican government sought to organize state \ninstitutions into ordered structures that promoted Mexico\u2019s economic growth and the social and \ncultural modernization of its population. For this reason, the state\u2019s instructional system adopted \npositivism as a modernizing ideology, and, in the case of medicine, turned the National School of \nMedicine, the Superior Board of Health, the Nat ional Academy of Medicine, and welfare \nhospitals into centers that aimed to control, regulate, and unify the medical profession. \nHomeopaths\u2019 efforts to reorganize their professional associations to acknowledge these \ninstitutions as centers of professional authority in the 1870s and D\u00edaz\u2019s support to create and \n                                                             \n98 See Porfiri o Diaz\u2019s Decree, August 10, 1895, that created the ENMH, in \"DECRETO,\" La homeopat\u00eda  \nIII.1 (1895): 3.   \n99 See a note published in El Universal on October 2, reprinted in \"La Escuela de Medicina Homeopatica \ny el progreso de las ciencias m\u00e9dicas,\" La medicina  cient\u00edfica  VIII.22 (1895).  100 \n fund a homeopathic hospital and regulate a school of homeopathic medicine in the 1890s \nfollowed this trend.  \nThe way these modernizing efforts aimed to transform the nation, its institutions, and its \npopulation favored particular elite groups and marginalized the rest of the population. The \nconstruction of homeopathy as a distinct medical profession in Mexico during the second half of \nthe 19th century is an example of such a tendency within the medical  profession. Homeopaths \nwho pushed for the professionalization of homeopathic professional societies and the creation of \nhomeopathic hospitals and schools belonged to urban medical elites. Moreover, their network of \nacquaintances was closely associated wit h D\u00edaz\u2019s extended family, which also occupied key \ngovernment positions. The status they had as graduates of the National School of Medicine and \nthe scientific rhetoric they used to position homeopathy as a therapy worth discussing within \nacademic circles w as the same as that used by the rest of the academic medical community to \ndistance itself from unprofessional forms of medical practice and unscientific forms of medical \nknowledge. Homeopathic physicians, hence, discredited and marginalized other homeopathic \nknowledge and practices that they regarded as less scientific and professional.  \nYet, p hysicians and the government used the growth of the population of irregular \nmedical practitioners as an argument to further state regulations. The presence and increasing \ngrowth of irregular practitioners\u2019 population motivated physicians, homeopathic ones included, \nto demand more comprehensive laws that attracted more state support to the medical profession, \ncreating a loop that perpetuated the social stratification of all medical practitioners, whether \nprofessionals or not, allopaths or homeopaths. By obta ining D\u00edaz\u2019s government support, \nhomeopathic physicians furthered the divide between regular and irregular medical practitioners \nin Mexico. If in the 1870s they supported it by acknowledging the status given by the possession 101 \n of a medical degree provided b y an official school and the use of a scientific rhetoric, in the \n1890s they created an institutional distinction between homeopathic and allopathic medical \ndoctors, and homeopathic and allopathic practitioners. Homeopathic physicians used those \npractition ers who could not have a place in professional homeopathic societies in the 1870s as a \nreason for the regulation of a homeopathic school that provided them adequate medical training.  \nIf the National Homeopathic Hospital and the National School of Homeopat hic Medicine \nwere symbols of the regulatory unification that governments sought during the Restored \nRepublic and the Porfiriato, at a narrower level they represented a true divide for the medical \nprofession .100 But if there existed other types of practitione rs and therapies in the la st quarter of \nthe 19th century, why did homeopathy in particular obtain Porfirio D\u00edaz\u2019s support? The answer \nlies in the nature of homeopathy as a medical system around which its practitioners found \nidentity  and the marginalizing a ttitude of academic physicians against it .101 Homeopathy was not \nan unorthodox group of medical beliefs in the second half of the 19th century, but by framing it \nas a distinct type of medical knowledge practiced by untrained people, academic physicians \npromp ted homeopaths\u2019 creation and organization of parallel medical institutions. Other groups \nsuch as midwives, while resisting control, eventually were assimilated and eliminated as a \nprofession .102 Clergymen and traditional healers provided free healing service s and in the case of \ntraditional medicine, had an alternative view of medicine, but they did not seek to organize into a \n                                                             \n100 See a note published in El Globo on Septeber 28, reprinted in Quevedo y Zubieta, \"La Homeopat\u00eda \noficial \u00f3 la Bifurcaci\u00f3n de la Ciencia,\" La medicina cient\u00edfica  VIII.22 (1895). ; and Carrillo, \n\"\u00bfIndivisibilidad o bifuraci\u00f3n de l a ciencia?: La institucionalizacion de la homeopat\u00eda en M\u00e9xico.\"  \n101 For a discussion about how heterodox medical practices in the 19th century constituted themselves as \nsuch see Cooter, \"Alternative Medicine, Alternative Cosmology.\"  \n102 See Carrillo, \"Nacimiento y muerte de una profesion. Las parteras tituladas en Mexico.\"  102 \n professional group .103 Therapies such as magnetism, hypnotism, dosimetric medicine, and \ntraditional herbal remedies were simply that, the rapies, and their theoretical background either fit \ncontemporary explanations of disease an d the body, or did not function  as ideologies that \nsocially organized and unified their practitioners.  \nHomeopathy was a medical system that attracted urban elites a nd middle class \npopulation, and for this reason it did what other therapeutic or medical approaches could not. It \nworked as an ideology that grouped educated citizens who in turn used it as a means to criticize \nthe elitist aspirations and monopolistic desi res of professional physicians. As in other countries \nwhere homeopaths organized into professional societies and created their own medical schools \nand hospitals ,104 in Mexico homeopathy gathered a group of practitioners, entrepreneurs, and \nphysicians around a single ideology and professional corporate body. Unlike these countries, \nMexican homeopathic physicians were unable to create major medical institutions, such as \nschools and hospitals, without the lack of sponsors , and even with them, homeopathic \nprofess ional societies only provided some basic medical training and small dispensaries or \nconsulting offices. Homeopathic physicians were able to raise homeopathy to the status of a \nscientific therapeutic approach, but they were not able to position it within th e curriculum of the \nNational School of Medicine. In contrast to the United States, where homeopathic institutions \nthrived thanks to a regulatory model that minimized the regulatory intervention of the state in \nprofessional medicine in the 19th century, in Mexico the centralizing regulatory policies of the \nPorfiriato led to the allocat ion of  state resources to support a homeopathic hospital and school. \n                                                             \n103 Ana Mar\u00eda Carrillo places these three groups of practitioners \u2013homeopaths, clergymen and traditional \nhealers - as groups that were resistant to control. See Carrillo, \"M\u00e9d icos del M\u00e9xico decimon\u00f3nico: entre \nel control estatal y la autonom\u00eda profesional,\" 161 -5. \n104 For the professional organization of homeopaths in England during the 19th century see Phillip A. \nNicholls, Homoeopathy and the Medical Profession  (London ; New York: Croom Helm, 1988). ; for the \nUS case see Kaufman, Homeopathy in America; the Rise and Fall of a Medical Heresy . 103 \n Hence, the case of homeopathy in Mexico provides a good example for understand ing how \nstrong state interven tion influenced the configuration of the Mexican medical profession in the \n19th century.  104 \n Chapter 3. Scientific Medical Training for the Working Class: Homeopathic Medical \nSchools and the Centralization of Medical Education in Mexico City, 1895 \u20131940  \nIn 1939, the newly created Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional  [National Polytechnic Institute] \ndistributed a booklet that explained the history, curriculum, institutional status, and reasons for \nthe inclusion of the National School of Homeopathic Medicine (ENMH) as one of the Institutes\u2019s \nfounding professional schools .1 The pamphlet argued that \u201chomeopathic medicine [\u2026] proposed \nto solve a tough problem[,\u2026] the provision of an efficient social service with a minimum cost to \nthe human masses.\u201d Accor ding to the text, homeopathy\u2019s primacy in providing such a service \nwas a consequence of its theoretical foundations and practices addressed specifically to \u201cthe \ncrowds of desheredados  [disenfranchised]\u201d, which the text identified with \u201cworkers, campesinos \n[farmers,\u2026]\u201d and those \u201cfighters of the socialist true\u201d who were still in their mothers\u2019 wombs.2 \nFor this reason and aligni ng with the socialist emphasis on education proposed by President \nL\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, the ENMH gained a position amidst the professional  schools intended to \nprovide professional training to the working class.  \nThis rhetoric reproduced arguments used by homeopathic practitioners and physicians \nwho had been trying to organize into a distinct professional group within the larger medical \nprofes sion since the mid -nineteenth century. Addressing medical training and healing services \nfor the working class granted homeopaths support from both the people and the state through the \n20th century, in spite of National -School -of-Medicine (ENM) graduates\u2019 g eneral opposition. In \ninstitutional terms, this rhetoric helped them to receive Porfirio D\u00edaz\u2019s support to open a National \nHomeopathic Hospital (HNH) and the ENMH in 1893 and 1895; it helped the Escuela Libre de \n                                                             \n1 Escuela Nacional de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica  (M\u00e9xico: Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica, Instituto \nPolit\u00e9cnico Nacional, Departa mento de Ense\u00f1anza Superior, T\u00e9cnica, Industrial, Comercial, Vocacional y \nPrevocacional, 1939).  \n2 See section \u201cImportancia de la medicina homeop\u00e1tica frente a la Revolucion Mexicana\u201d in Escuela \nNacional de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica   35-6. 105 \n Homeopat\u00eda de M\u00e9xico [Free School of Homeopa thy of Mexico, hereon ELHM] to attract \nstudents and become the largest homeopathic medical school in Mexico in the 1920s and 30s; \nand it also helped to reinsta te the ENMH as a state medical school during the C\u00e1rdenas \nadministration after the National Unive rsity dis solved it in 1925. The homeopathic medical \nsystem and professional schools thrived in the first half of the 20th century due to homeopaths\u2019 \nability to align their training institutions with different governments\u2019 populist policies that aimed \nto br ing professional education to the working class.  \nThe way different homeopathic groups used the rhetoric of educating the working class \nintertwined with the state \u2019s educational and administrative policies and the interests of the larger \nmedical and local h omeopathic communities . The complex interplay between educating the \nworking class, providing modern scientific medical training, and financing the complex facilities \nthis type of training demanded led to the diversification of homeopathic schools in Mexico  City. \nFurthermore, the institutional shifts that the two schools that emerged as a result of this process \nwent through was also the result of a difficult social, political, cultural, and institutional process \nof institutionalization of the Revolution of 1 910 during the decade 1920 \u201330. The provision of \nmedical training to the working class was not a simple issue in Mexico City either in the \nPorfiriato when social elites integrated the medical profession and enjoyed the favor of Porfirio \nD\u00edaz or after the re volution when military leaders contended for political power and struggled to \ncreate modern institutions that fulfilled the promises of the revolution. The revolution acquired \ndifferent meanings for different homeopathic groups. While for ELHM founders it meant \nproviding medical education to those who could not attend the ENM, for ENMH authorities it \nmeant that the state provided the resources to improve medical training. While different \nadministrations favored one or the other for various \u2014 mostly politica l rather than academic  \u2014 106 \n reasons , eventually wha t made both institutions thrive  was students\u2019 resistance to be ing coopted \nby top -down regulation of medical training.  \nAs I will analyze in thi s chapter, this  divide influenced these homeopathic schools\u2019 \npositions within government institutions and state regulations, the financial support they \nreceived, the quality of their facilities, their academic curriculum structure s, and their student \npopulation structure s and graduation rate s. Eventually, the ENMH\u2019s model that reproduced the \nENM\u2019s ended up in the former school\u2019s incorporation into the latter, leaving the model that \naddressed the working -class needs as the only one through which homeopathic medical training \nsurvived. Eventually , the interventionist state regulated in favor of academic -medical -curriculum \nuniformity and adequate teaching facilities. Yet its compromise to fulfill social demands \u2014 \nspecially the provision o f training to the working class \u2014 led it to listen to homeopa ths and keep \ntheir schools alive . \nThe doctrina ire struggles within the homeopathic profession, the push of university \nphysicians to unify and standardize medical training, and the state\u2019s intervention in regulating \nmedical schools interplayed to create a d iverse set of medical schools, including homeopathic \nones, in Mexico City. The socio -economic and political diversity of actors and institutions made \nthe unification of professional medical training a nuanced process that while giving uniformity to \nthe med ical curriculum, also retained institutional diversity. The disputes between the groups that \nheaded medical schools in Mexico City during the process of reconstruction after the armed \nphase of the Mexican Revolution raise questions about the role of a revo lutionary state in the \nconfiguration of the medical profession in Mexico. In other words, it provides an opportunity to 107 \n trace the specific \u201cpolitical geographies\u201d in Mexico that decided over the \u201cscience wars\u201d \nbetween homeopathy and the rest of the medical  profession .3 \nThis chapter analyzes the institutional history of homeopathic medical schools in Mexico \nCity during the first four decades of the twentieth century. The politics of the creation, closure, \nand re -intallment of the ENMH as well as those that c reated and regulated the ELHM \ndemonstrate how class, medical science, and the state intertwined to diversify medical education \nin Mexico City. I will follow a chronological sequence to compare and contrast how different \nstate policies worked on the ground in homeopathic medical schools. The first section describes \nthe professional politics that led to the creation of the ENMH, how these influenced the medical \nschool\u2019s position in the Porfirian  administration, and the consequences this position ha d \nregarding  the quality of medical training offered at this school. The second section explains how \nthe revolution introduced a new rhetoric that different groups within the homeopathic community \nused to either create a new homeopathic medical school, as in the case of the ELHM, or obtain \nstate sup port, as the ENMH did. In the thi rd section, I analyze the role that state regulation and \nmedical science played in the transformation of the ENMH into a medical specialty. I show how \nprofessional aspirations of ENMH graduat es aligned with the administrative centralization and \nideological unification of ENM authorities and graduates, while the doctrinarian vision of  \nhomeopathy of  ELHM students and faculty led them to oppose such tendencies and constitute a \nmedical group and s chool that resisted state regulation and ideological imposition.  \n                                                             \n3 For the concept of b oundary formation, epistemological geographies and science wars see Thomas F. \nGieryn, Cultural Boundaries of Science: Credibility on the Line  (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, \n1999).   108 \n The \u201cbifurcation of science\u201d to prevent \u201cabuse\u201d: The National School of Homeopathic \nMedicine and the politics of medical training marginalization, 1895 \u20131910  \nAs I analyzed in chapter 2, a direct consequence of the success of homeopathic \ntherapeutics as applied in the National Homeopathic Hospital was that Porfirio D\u00edaz regulated \nhomeopathic medical training that was already being offered by homeopathic professional \nsocieties through the A cademy of Homeopathy.4 This academy was structured as a regular \nmedical school. Some of its faculty members were ENM graduates, and the courses they taught \nwere the same as the ones included in the ENM\u2019s academic curriculum (see Table 1). The \nacademy offer ed courses such as anatomy, clinical practice, materia medica, pathology, hygiene, \nsurgery, physiology, and pharmacology .5 With D\u00edaz\u2019s regulation, the hospital hosted the \nacademy and became the ENMH.  \nD\u00edaz\u2019s regulation compelled the n ew homeopathic school to include courses that \n\u201cembraced all the scientific knowledge that [was] required by law\u201d, standardizing requirements \nfor enrollment and academic curricula in all medical schools in Mexico City .6 Now all ENMH \n                                                             \n4 Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado, one of the homeopathic physicians who re quested the creation of the National \nHomeopathic Hospital, already headed an Academy of Homeopathy hosted by the homeopaths\u2019 \nprofessional society when the hospital opened.

Dr. \nSegura y Pesado was the head and also taught anatomy; Dr. Bernab\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez was secretary; Dr. \nIgnacio Fern\u00e1ndez de Lara taught clinical practice; Dr. Pablo Fuentes y Herrera, materia medica ; Dr. Juan \nN.

N\u00famero 34. 1984, \ncited in Francois Flores, Historia de la homeopat\u00eda en M\u00e9xico   32. \n6 The Law of Public Instruction regulated professional schools\u2019 academic curriculum in the Federal \nDistrict and the Federal Territories. D\u00edaz\u2019s signed the dec ree on August 10, 1895. It would not be \neffective until January 1, 1896. This regulatory trend did not differ from previous attempts to regulate \nhomeopathic medical training in Veracruz and Puebla in the early 1880s, where students of homeopathy \nneeded to be proficient in almost the same curricular content as their non -homeopathic peers. In addition, 109 \n prospective students needed to have previously  attended the National Preparatory School. To \nobtain their medical degree, they had to undertake 19 courses in a span of five years after which \nthey took their professional exam. The new academic curriculum of the homeopathic school was \nthematically a copy  of the one offered by the ENM, though less extensive in terms of the number \nof courses taught for a single topic (see Table 1). For instance the ENM offered one course more \nof internal and external pathology, and of internal and external clinical practice . Instead the \nENMH offered three extra -courses on materia medica and therapeutics. The ENMH curriculum \nalso offered the course \u201cFoundations and expositions of the [homeopathic] doctrine\u201d, which the \nENM did not.  \nD\u00edaz\u2019s regulation of homeopathic medical tra ining also resulted in the legal recognition \nof ENMH\u2019s medical degrees. The decree required ENMH\u2019s professors to be legal phy sicians, in \nother  words, holders of degrees obtained in state -regulated medical schools. They also needed to \nbe members of the home opathic professional society. With regular professors and an authorized \nmedical curriculum, the ENMH medical degree acquired a legal status that according to the \ndecree aimed to protect consumers of homeopathy by \u201cpreventing the abuse of those who \npractice  without the authorized knowledge or medical degree\u201d .7 The Academy was given the \nstatus of \u201cnational\u201d \u2014 hence the name of the school  \u2014 just to make its courses legal, and to give \nthose who obtained the degree of M\u00e9dico Cirujano Home\u00f3pata  [Homeopathic Medic al Doctor] \nthe same rights and obligations as M\u00e9dicos Cirujanos Al\u00f3patas [Medical Doctors] . With such \nintentions, D\u00edaz seemed to cope with one of Mexico City\u2019s persistent problems during his 30 -\nyear term, the presence of irregular practitioners. Having a s tate-sanctioned school for a \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nthey need to undertake courses proper to homeopathy. The internal regulations of the Academy of \nHomeopathy followed D\u00edaz\u2019s decree in the configuration of its a cademic curriculum. See \"DECRETO.\" ; \nand \u201cReglamento de la Escuela Nacional de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico\u201d, AHSS, BP, \nEH, HNH, 1, 5.  \n7 See \"DECRETO.\"   110 \n therapeutic system that was widely consumed, but most importantly prescribed, by both social \nelites and the working -class seemed to provide medical training to individuals who could not \nafford elite medical training at the ENM.  In other words, D\u00edaz aimed to regulate irregular \npractice by providing medical training to the working class.  \nThe position of the ENMH within Porfirian , Madero\u2019s, and Huerta\u2019s government \nstructures hindered its material progress for two decades. The home opathic hospital hosted the \nschool during this period, and the Ministry of the Interior, which funded the hospital, did not pay \nfor faculty salaries or other ENMH\u2019s specific needs .8 Material improvements to the hospital \nimpacted the school, though, which m eant that any improvement to the hospital also improved \nthe school .9 For instance, the hospital provided classrooms for lectures and facilities and patients \nto carry out clinical practices. Moreover, the Ministry did not originally give any medical \ninstrum entation t o the hospital in 1895. Sixteen years later, the hospital\u2019s inventory registered a \nlarge list of \u201cscientific instruments\u201d which were useful for clinical practice and might also be \nused for instruction .10  \nThroughout the first two decades of the 20th century, the ENMH remained beyond the \nregulatory efforts of the Ministry of Public Instruction. Consequently, ENM graduates who \ncontrolled this Ministry and who questioned ENMH\u2019s medical training and existence as a state -\nfunded medical school could not control or update its academic curriculum as they did with the \nENM\u2019s. ENM graduates such as Quevedo y Zubieta and Porfirio Parra regarded the state \n                                                             \n8 The section of the homeopathic hospital in the AHSS  holds several letters with petitions from Joaqu\u00edn \nSegura y Pesado, head of both the hospital and the school during this period, to either the Ministry of the \nInterior or the head of the Office of Public Welfare to request material for the out -patient clin ic, but \nnothing specific for the school during this time period. See AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 7.  \n9 In 1910 the head of the hospital requested painting for the hospital facilities because it would host a \nmeeting with foreign homeopathic practitioners to comme morate the anniversary of Mexico\u2019s \nindependence. He also requested other minor fixes produced by an earthquake and the rainy season during \n1911.

Instead of opening schools for every medical method or procedure, Quevedo said, \nthe government should provide material elements to advance the practical instru ction of basic \nsciences in one single medical school. Moreover, he denounced the structural contradiction of \nDiaz\u2019s government by placing the homeopathic school outside the jurisdiction of the ministry \nthat regulated public instruction. This opinion persis ted after a decade. When D\u00edaz asked \nEduardo Liceaga, head of the ENM, about opening a new homeopathic school in 1904, Liceaga \nreplied that homeopathy only differed from medical science \u201cin the way it prescribed \nmedicines\u201d, and as a consequence, he deemed a s administratively illogic al to keep a separated \nschool or create a new one which would offer the same medical training as in the ENM . \u201cThere \nwould not be any reason to build a National Homeopathic School [\u2026] just because [that school] \nuses a special modal ity to prescribe medications\u201d, he concluded.12 \nIts position outside the Ministry of Justice and Public Instruction ma de ENMH lag  behind \nENM\u2019s curricular reforms. The ENM\u2019s curriculum went through four changes during the \nPorfiriato  in order to cope with the dramatic changes taking place in the medical sciences at turn \nof the 20th century. Curricular changes aimed to expose new medical students to specialties such \nas bacteriology, histology, mental diseases, gynecology, and ophthalmology  \u2014 all topics offered \n                                                             \n11 The term was Quevedo\u2019s, but both held a similar opinion about homeopathy and the ENMH. Quevedo \ny Zubieta, \"La Homeopat\u00eda oficial \u00f3 la Bifurcaci\u00f3n de la Ciencia.\" , reprinted in El Globo  September 28, \n1895; and Porfirio Parra, \"La sanci\u00f3n legal de la homeopat\u00eda,\" La escuela de medicina .septiembre y \noctubre (1895).  \n12 The new school of homeopathy did not open, but Eduardo Liceaga and the ministry of instruction did \nnot have authority to stop the ENMH from working. See Justino Fernandez, Correspondencia Particular \nDel Secretario De Justicia E Instrucci\u00f3n P\u00fablica, AHUNAM, ENM, ENMH, 43, 4, P. 21; and Eduardo \nLiceaga, Personal letter to the Ministry of Justice and Public Instruction, AHUNAM, ENM, ENMH, 43, \n4, pp. 27-33. 112 \n in the most re nowned medical schools in Europe .13 These changes continued after 1910 for \npolitical rather than academic reasons .14 The pedagogic impulse that drove such changes was \nlearning thro ugh practice rather than theory,  at the bedside and in the hospit al, in cadaver s and \npatients, rather than in libraries using texts and printed images.  \nIn contrast, the ENMH\u2019s curriculum remained unmodified until 1916 (See T able 1). Yet \nENMH dissertation  titles suggest that this unmodified curriculum did not influence graduates to \nmerely pursue careers in homeopathy, as some E NM graduates argued (see below), t hough \nhaving a faculty of homeopaths did have an effect on students\u2019 interest i n this particular \ntherapy .15 Half of the  dissertations approached regular medical iss ues such as pleurisy, puerperal \nfever, gastric disorders or dietetics, antiseptics, epidemic diseases, and medicinal plants, and the \nrest discussed the philosophical principles behind homeopathy, the therapeutic superiority of \nhomeopathy over surgery or ot her allopathic therapeutic procedures, and the homeopathic way to \ntreat specific diseases.  \nAs a consequence of the homeopathic school\u2019s lag in facility improvements and \ncurricular updates, it turned into a second -class medical school . While still offering  basic \nmedical training, it did not withst and the changes in medical science that were taking place \nduring the first decades of the 20th century. In  the eyes of the medical elite, homeopathic doctors \n                                                             \n13 In 1881, 1897, 1902, 1906.

Enriq ue Herrera Moreno analyses the ENM\u2019s curricular changes from 1833 to \nthe early 1920s.

Juan Antiga kept a track of ENMH\u2019s dissertations in \nAntiga, \"Un resumen de la historia de la homeopat\u00eda de M\u00e9x ico.\" There are only three dissertations that \ndiscussed homeopathy in the ENM during the 19th century registered in Carmen Casta\u00f1eda de Infante, \nCat\u00e1ogo de tesis de medicina del siglo XIX  (M\u00e9xico, D.F.: Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, \nCentro de Es tudios sobre la Universidad, 1988). .  113 \n were poorly trained physicians who specialized in the us e of a single therapeutic approach .16 In \nthese terms, the goal of the homeopathic physicians who created the ENMH to uplift the status of \nhomeopathy failed in the long term. However, in numerical terms, the homeopathic school \nbecame the second more important medical school in the city in terms of the number of \ngraduates it produced. In 1900, a national c ensus reported that only 9.3% of the total number of \nphysicians in Mexico City was homeopaths; 8.2 if considered nationally. The DSP records show \nthat the proportion of homeopaths vs. allopaths with license to practice medicine in Mexico City \nincreased from 3.7% to 6.9% from 1871 to 1907  (See Table 2) .17 While these statistics su ggest a \nsuccess of the homeopathic school in terms of regulating the homeopathic profession, they also \nprovided ENM faculty with the information to argue that this school only diverted state funds \nthat otherwise could be used in the ENM\u2019s academic and mate rial improvement.  \n \n                                                             \n16 See Justino Fernandez, Correspondencia Particular Del Secretario De Justicia E Instrucci\u00f3n P\u00fablica, \nAHUNAM, ENM, ENMH, 43, 4, p. 21; and Eduardo Liceaga, Personal letter to the Ministry of Justice \nand Public Instruct ion, AHUNAM, ENM, ENMH, 43, 4, pp. 27-33.

The school\u2019s faculty elected a new Dean and Directive Board, which were \nratified by Carranza\u2019s government in 1914 .18 Led by the new Dean, Luis F. Porragas, the ENMH \nwent through curricular improvements in exchange for the go vernment\u2019s economic support \nduring Carranza\u2019s term. Using a revolutionary rhetoric, Porragas explained the school\u2019s slow \nprogress as a consequence of the lack of economic support in July 1916 . Accordingly, the \n\u201chomeopathic physician needs to sacrifice his time to provide an inefficient and unpaid \nservice.\u201d19 Porragas did not blame his faculty \u201cfor the human heart seeks improvements, which \n[the homeopath] cannot achieve when he comes to the School for jobs without stipend.\u201d20 For \nthis reason, he demanded t hat the new Minister of the Interior include the school in the \nMinistry\u2019s budget. \u201c[A]s the revolution came to protect everything that implies improvement \u2014 \nPorragas said \u2014 [\u2026] we [\u2026] revolutionaries by heart [\u2026] come to tell you with adherence to \nthe law, and  according to our humanitarian motto, give the support that the noble cause we \nsustain demands\u201d.21 A few months later, the school\u2019s Board authorized a new curriculum that \nshowed that the medical \u201cknowledge provided by [the homeopathic school was] the same a s the \n                                                             \n18 Correspo ndence between the Office of Public Welfare, the Subminster of the Interior and the Dean of \nthe ENMH, during October, 1914, see AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 22, pp. 1 -4.  \n19 See L etter from Luis F.

Founders of the ENMH adopted \nthe 19th century discourse that sought ho meopathy to thrive as a medical system and profession, \nparallel to what they called allopathy or the traditional school. For this reason, they wanted the \nsame legal and social status for their school as the ENM had. In contrast, Porragas internalized \nthe d iscourse of the medical elite, recognizing that the school \u201chad not progressed as desired\u201d \nand that students \u201chad not achieved all the required knowledge\u201d .23 Founders of the ENMH \noffered their professional services as charity, in order to secure government support. This new \ngeneration of homeopathic doctors sought a new relationship with the government that \ndemanded remuneration for professional services .24 For instance, Rafael Isa\u00edas y Fern\u00e1ndez, head \nof the homeopathic hospital in 1916, requested that homeo pathic doctors and students with their \nclinical practices at the institution receive a stipend; \u201cbesides being fair that they receive [such a \nstipend] in payment for their work, it creates the right to demand the exact fulfillment of their \nduties.\u201d25  \nBut h omeopaths \u2019 demands surpassed what the government was willing to grant. \nMoreover, obtaining government support implied that homeopathic institutions depended \ndirectly on the volatile politics of the time.

He even granted that if there was no ward available for the \nschool, modifications should be carried out i n the General Hospital to fulfill his demands. But \nthe relocation of the ENMH was more expensive than keeping the hospital in its place, and both \nthe school and hospital remained untouched .29 After the politically turbulent and deeply violent \nyears of the armed phase of the revolution when Carranza started to reconstruct the state\u2019s \ninstitutions, homeopaths\u2019 demands went beyond Carranza\u2019s political and economic willingness \nto support homeopaths \u2019 school. However, during this decade a different model of professional \neduca tion started to develop.  \nThe model of escuelas libres [literally free schools, referred to those schools that did not \nreceive state funds; in other words private schools] emerged in 1912, amidst the revolutionary \n                                                             \n26 A letter \u2013presumably from Luis F.

Political instability and inconsistencies in the regulatory framewo rk at the \nnational level did not allowed university authorities to extend their policies beyond Mexico City. \nBut even in the city, the model of free schools aimed to counterweight the authority of the \nuniversity.  \nThe Escuela Libre de Derecho [Free School o f Law] first initiated operations in 1912, \nclosely followed by the Escuela Libre de Homeopatia  [hereon ELHM after its current name Free \nSchool of Homeopathy of Mexico]. Rather than an open effort to undermine the UNM\u2019s \nauthority, as the Free School of Law was, the ELHM started as an effort to provide homeopathic \ntraining to the working class. Its founder, Higinio G. P\u00e9rez , would use this rhetoric to attract a \nlarger population of students contrasted to the one the ENMH received, promoting  the model of a \n                                                             \n30 Francisco A rce Gurza, \"El inicio de una Nueva Era, 1910 -1945,\" Historia de las profesiones en M\u00e9xico , \ned.

Since the regula tion of medical \nschools and particularly homeopathic ones closely depended on the relationship of the university with the \nfederal government, I want to make clear the difference between an institution closely aligned in \nadministrative terms with the acrony m UNM, and one with autonomy the autonomy for curricular and \nadministrative self -regulation with the acronym UNAM.

Perez adopted the rhetoric used  50 \nyears earlier by homeopathic practitioners and entrepreneurs to provide healing services and sell \nhomeopathic first -aid kits to those who did not have access to a p hysician. Perez used his \nparticular approach to homeopathy as an ideology under which he created a group that defended \nthe rights of the working -class to have access to medical training.  \nJust as Porragas represented a group of homeopaths who had assimilat ed the need for an \neducation based on the new medical sciences and was willing to align ENMH\u2019s curriculum with \nENM\u2019s ,34 Higinio P\u00e9rez represented a group that was not convinced that all medical science and \nscientific breakthroughs benefited the homeopathic physician. This tension between being a true \nhomeopath or one who used other therapeutic approaches besides homeopathy had always been \nan issue of concern among homeopaths and their critics .35 But in a school specifically designed \nto teach homeopathy, homeo paths needed to clarify their position, as Porragas did in 1916. Yet \nduring the early days of the ENMH , this position was far from clear. Having a curriculum that \n                                                             \n34 Porragas\u2019 position is difficult to assess. He did modify the ENMH\u2019s academic curriculum in 1916, but \nit seems that he did it to obtain funds to improve t he homeopathic school, rather than for any doctrinarian \nconviction. As I will analyze below, he was also a member of the Academy that Higinio P\u00e9rez created to \ngroup together those homeopaths who pursued orthodox homeopathy in 1910. In the early 1920s, he \nnever showed up to discuss the eventual merging of the ENMH to the ENM, probably regarding it as a \nlost cause. Rather than someone who ceded to allopathy, he should be regarded as someone who took the \nopportunities he found to attract resources to the ENMH.  Though in so doing it he tacitly acknowledged \nthe medical ideology imposed by the ENM academic curriculum. See below for an analysis of ENMH \nmerger to the ENM.  \n35 In the 1870s the distinction between pure homeopaths and those who were not pure was based o n the \nuse of highly diluted doses or not. Generally, physicians educated at the ENM believed that it was \nnecessary to prove all dilutions even concentrated ones in order to see their effects, while practitioners \ngenerally preferred to stick to Hahnemann\u2019s works and use only highly diluted doses.

He did not dare to \nprescribe a diluted and dynamized fibroid polyp as he should\u2019ve done if he were a faithful disciple of \nHahnemann, missing the \u2018similia similibus\u2019.

No doctor should place one method as \u201cthe single one, \u2018sinequa non\u2019 of the \ntherapeutic desideratum.\u201d39 The contradict ion between being a \u201c good homeopathic doctor\u201d or a \n                                                             \n36 He was a Cuban immigrant who obtained a homeopathic degree from the ENMH in 1901 and who \nsponsored a homeopathic society and jour nal in the 1910s. He graduated as a physician from the \nUniversity of Havana in 1892. His activities supporting Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed and his revolutionary movement led \nhim to travel widely between the island and the US. He arrived in Mexico in 1896 where he obtained a \ndegree from the ENM and later from the ENMH. The Sanitary Board of Health sent him with a \ncommission to study yellow fever to Chiapas. From there he travelled widely throughout Central and \nSouth America. He was professor of Pathology at the Free Universi ty of El Salvador; he practiced \nmedicine in Costa Rica, and Ecuador. He returned to Mexico in 1899 and established as a homeopathic \ndoctor. He was one of the founders of the Academia Homeop\u00e1tica Mexicana in 1904. He was editor of La \nPropaganda homeop\u00e1tica since 1902 until he stop publishing it in 1908. There he publicized homeopathy \nand other therapeutic commodities he distributed in Mexico City. He left Mexico in 1911.

His own particular vision of \nhomeopathy did not materialize until 1910 when he gathered a group of ENMH graduates into an \nacademic society of \u201cradical purists\u201d that aimed to establish as a parallel institut ion to the \nNational Academy of Medicine, hence its name, Academia Homeop\u00e1tica de Mexico  \n[Homeopathic Academy of Mexico] .41 Members of this new academy proposed to use \ntherapeutic approaches that resembled or stimulated the body\u2019s nat ural way of healing  and \nconsequently rejected approaches that opposed natural healing forces and produced a non -\nnatural, sometimes worse, form of disease .42 Highlighting that this was the truly core of \n                                                             \n40 He followed an orthodox career path for a physician who did not belong to urban elites during the \nPorfiriato , and for a student of medicine who eventually became a homeopath. He was born in \nAlfajayucan, Hidalgo, a town loca ted 75 miles north from Mexico City, in 1865. He spent his early years \nstudying at the local church before moving to the state\u2019s capital seminar to pursue an ecclesiastical career. \nP\u00e9rez subsequently moved to Mexico City where he attempted to study laws, b ut after a couple of years in \nthe ENM he ended up studying medicine in the ENMH. After three years, he graduated in 1899 with the \ndissertation title: \u201cMorbid individuality\u201d. He became faculty member of his alma mater, where he taught \nGeneral Pathology and Histology. He established a private practice in Mexico City in the early years of \nthe 20th century.

This Board was integrated by Francisco Castillo, President, \nHiginio G. P\u00e9rez, Vice -president, Alfredo Ortega , Secretary, and Luis F. Porragas, Treasurer. While not \npart of the Board, Joaqu\u00edn Segura y Pesado and Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez de Lara figured as honorary President \nand Vice -President, respectively, acknowledging their status as founders of the National Homeopat hic \nHospital and School. \u201cActa de Instalaci\u00f3n de la Academia Homeop\u00e1tica de M\u00e9xico\u201d, Archivo de la \nEscuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda de M\u00e9xico [here on AELHM], pp. 1.  \n42 For instance, they believed that orthodox homeopathy did not oppose to general practices in medicine \nsuch as surgery, toxicology, hygiene, and mechanical medicine, but they were specific about the \nprohibition of certain contemporary therapies, such as antiseptics, thermal waters, caustics, cauteries, \nplasters, concoctions, and poultices. They did  not like injections to introduce serum, narcotics, or \nanalgesics in the body, not even as palliative medicine, but they believed that a true homeopath could use \nthat type of therapy only if the patient asked for it. They also disagreed with cleansing inje ctions for \nnatural childbirths, but totally agreed with anesthetic injections for surgery. \u201cAlocuci\u00f3n del Dr. Higinio G. \nP\u00e9rez, al inaugurarse la Academia Homeop\u00e1tica de M\u00e9xico\u201d. Actas de la Academia Homeop\u00e1tica de 125 \n Hahnemann\u2019s homeopathic doctrine, Higinio P\u00e9rez applied a sectarian ethos to this particular \napproach to homeopathy. In his speech at the Academy\u2019s inauguration, he compared \u201corthodox\u201d \nhomeopathy to the \u201ceternal truth\u201d, and criticized those who \u201cdiverted their steps from the \npathway of light and preferred to walk through the dark and  lost path of Allopathy.\u201d For him, the \n\u201ctrue homeopath\u201d was a \u201ctrue priest of medicine and apostle of the altruistic science that \nhomeopathy was\u201d.43 \nHiginio P \u00e9rez pursued such \u201chomeopathic altruism\u201d to create a proprietary homeopathic \nschool with working cl ass sensibilities.44 The narratives about ELHM origins point to its \nworking -class sensibilities rather than to its medical sectarian emphasis, though once established , \nthe school turned into a symbol of medical sectarianism, working -class rights to medical \ntraining, and independence from government regulation . In 1912, two disappointed working -\nclass students who could not attend the ENMH approached Higinio G. P\u00e9rez for advice. He \noffered himself to lecture if they gathered a bigger group. One month later, tw enty persons , \nprofessional teachers or students who could not continue their professional studies , attended \nP\u00e9rez \u2019s classes early in the morning and late at night, a schedule particularly suited for those who \nattended regular job duties.45 Consequently, t he newly created  Escuela Libre de Pr\u00e1cticos \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nM\u00e9xico, AELHM, pp. 3 -4.; and also Session  of February 1, 1910, Actas de la Academia Homeop\u00e1tica de \nM\u00e9xico, AELHM, pp. 13 -16. \n43 \u201cAlocuci\u00f3n del Dr. Higinio G. P\u00e9rez, al inaugurarse la Academia Homeop\u00e1tica de M\u00e9xico\u201d  \n44 The life of the Academy was ephemeral, probably as a result of the political turmoil during 1910. Their \nmembers stop gathering after a few months, but they continued supporting homeopathy, sometimes \neffectively sometimes not. For instance, Luis F. Porraga s tried to improve medical education in the \nENMH. Jos\u00e9 D. Conde Perera became the president of the Sociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1tica de Yucat\u00e1n in \nthe early 1920s. This society created a homeopathic school within the Universidad Nacional del Sureste , \nwhen Conde Perera was president. \"La Sociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1tica de Yucat\u00e1n, solicita la creaci\u00f3n de \nla Escuela Especial de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica,\" Revista de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica  I.9 (1922).  The \nsociety opened a homeopathic hospital too. \"El gobernador Dn. Felipe Car rillo visita la Facultad y el \nHospital homeop\u00e1ticos,\" Revista de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica  2.1 (1922).  \n45 The early account of the Escuela Libre  is taken from Querido Moheno, \"En defensa de los home\u00f3patas. \nAlegato del lic. Querido Moheno ante la Suprema Corte de  Justicia de la Uni\u00f3n,\"  (M\u00e9xico: 1924), vol., \n75 - 76. See also Francois Francois -Flores, La Escuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda   71-81. 126 \n Home\u00f3patas [Free School of Homeopathic Practitioners]  aimed to train working class students. \nHowever, acknowledging that they were receiving professional training, students decided to \nrename the institution as Escu ela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda [Free School of Homeopathy] six months \nlater after it was established. This insinuated students\u2019 desire to be considred professional doctors \nas a logical consequence of the training they received. Eventually this aspiration led them  to \nconfront the state\u2019s policies that regulated the medical profession.  \nIn contrast to the ENMH, the ELHM was the result of one individual\u2019s efforts to provide \neducation to the working class. Consequently its material resources were limited , and its \nacade mic curriculum was not as developed as the ENM\u2019s. Higinio P\u00e9rez\u2019s own residences \noriginally hosted the school, but the increasing demand made him look for new facilities that \naccommodated classrooms and a sanatorium  in 1913. In  1917, the medical sanatorium  was \ntransformed into a small clinic and a consulting office.  In 1913, t he ELHM\u2019s academic \ncurriculum was not as developed as the one offered at the ENM or the ENMH  (See Table 1) . The \nELHM offered 14 courses distributed over four years. Contrasted to the E NM\u2019s curriculum, the \nELHM offered no training in \u201cbasic sciences\u201d such as medical chemistry, medical physics, \nhistology, and bacteriology ; also no dissection practice, less clinical practice, and no courses on \npharmacy or physiotherapy. In contrast to the ENMH\u2019s curriculum, the difference was mainly in \nextent , for both schools offered the same courses.  \nIn 1921, after having remodeled his own house and installed new facilities, Perez moved \nthe school back to its original installations. The remodeled building  had now classrooms \nspecifically dedicated to courses of surgery and obstetrics, a laboratory, three rooms for clinical \npractices, one conference room, one consulting office where students offered free medical \nservices, a library, administrative offices an d a large green area. Eventually, an amphitheater w as 127 \n built; meanwhile students started doing their dissection practices at the crematories of \u201cDolores\u201d \nGraveyard. Students had been requesting cadaver s, bones or skulls to this graveyard early since \nthe cre ation of the school, but in 1921 they obtained a permission from the local government to \ndo their dissection practices early in the morning, from 6 to 8 am, before attendants to the \ncemetery arrive d. In exchange, the local governor requested students open  up four free \nconsulting offices to provide medical services to the population who lived near the graveyard.46 \nIn exchence of material resources to complete their training, homeopaths offered health services \nwhich in turn gave them the clinical practice thei r training required. In curricular terms, the \ndifferences between the  ENM and ELHM remained the same through the second half of the \n1910s (see Table 1).  \nAs an additional provider of medical training to the population of Mexico City in the \nearly 1910s, the  ELHM and its model for proprietary medical schools became the target of \ncritiques from the medical establishment. Francisco I. Madero , the land owner and homeopath \nthat I analyzed in Chapter 1, became the first democratically elected President after 30 ye ars of \ndictatorship. Having a President that used, practiced, and promoted h omeopathy caused \nuncertainty among  the National Academy of Medicine. This uncertainty was dissipated w hen \nMadero acknowledge d the Academy early in 1912  as an official institution t hat his government \nwould consult on matters of sanitation, medicine , and health .47 Consequently, t he Academy felt \nless compromised to make a public critiques to  homeopathic practice. For instance, during a \ncelebration to congratulate Madero\u2019s decision, Rica rdo E. Manuell, President of the Academy, \ntalked about how medical science had defeated most of the \u201cplagues\u201d in the country, but not the \n                                                             \n46 See AHCM, AGDF, P, AV 3469, 108.  See AHCM, AGDF, PD 3513, 1132; 3520, 1555; and 3469, 108.  \n47 The Academy requested such acknowledgment to Presdient Madero. On January 9, 1912, D\u00edaz \nLombardo replied that Madero acknowledged it as an \u201coficial institituion\u201d \"La Academia N. de Medicina \nde M\u00e9xico, ha recibido la siguiente comunicaci\u00f3n,\" Gaceta m\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico  XLIX (1912).   128 \n most important, the free practice of medicine .48 According to him, the lack of regulation of \nmedical practice in Mexico  caused several problems amongst which he included homeopathy. \nFor him homeopaths were a \u201cnational flora that corroded the nation\u201d whose practice of \nprescribing globules that lacked any medical substance turned them into \u201cmurderers\u201d and \n\u201ccriminals\u201d who lef t a wounded person  bleeding.  \nThis attitude extended to the medical community, leading Eduardo Lavalle y Carbajal to \ncriticize the lack of regulations for medical practice and the recently created ELHM .49 Based on \nhis appraisal of the recently created Free School of Law, he criticized the possible obstacles that \na \u201chypothetical\u201d50 free medical school might face without funding from such businessmen as \nRockefeller. For him, a high -quality medical education required t he building of dissection rooms \nand hospital s, where students could be trained using the \u201cthree vir tues\u201d of good medical training \n\u2014 cadaver s, laboratories, and patients with different kinds of diseases. Such a school, he \n                                                             \n48 Among these were native people\u2019s healing approaches mingled with traditional religious beliefs; \u201cmore \ncivilized\u201d domestic remedies whose curative powers were testified by large lists of professionals, even \nphysicians; charlatans w ho spectacularly advertised their services in the streets, offering secret remedies \nto heal incurable diseases; new drugs or serums whose therapeutic efficacy was certified by non medical \nauthorities such as judges, governors, bishops and the like; and med ical consultation by mail. Ricardo E. \nManuell, \"DISCURSO pronunciado por su autor, en la sesi\u00f3n celebrada en el anfiteatro de la Escuela \nPreparatoria, el 6 de marzo de 1912,\" Gaceta m\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico  VII (Tercera Serie) or XLIX.3 (marzo) \n(1912).  \n49 For his analysis about the regulation of medical practice, see Eduardo Lavalle y Carbajal, \"Historia de \nla medicina en M\u00e9xico. A los m\u00e9dicos debe exig\u00edrseles t\u00edtulo oficial u oficialmente revalidado,\" Gaceta \nm\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico  L.9 (septiembre) (1913).   \n50 His work explicitly referred to a hypothetical free school. Yet it is unlikely that Lavalle was not aware \nof the newly created ELHM. Medical doctors who engaged in historical or sociological research during \nthe twenties rarely recognized private medical scho ols, and when they did it, they considered them too \nunworthy to be studied. For instance, when in 1926 the National Academy of Medicine called for a prize \nto the best research that analyzed the contemporary status of medical education in Mexico, none of th e \nsubmitted works included a discussion of private schools, not even the ELHM which by that year had \ngraduated 166 students. Only Esteban Pous Ch\u00e1zaro mentioned that he would not include \u201cthose so -called \nschools that were a plain manifestation of medical p iracy\u201d.  \"Dictamen que presenta la comisi\u00f3n \ndesignada por la Academia Nacional de Medicina para juzgar los trabajos presentados la concurso anual. \nPrimer Tema: 'Estado Actual de la Medicina en la Rep\u00fablica,\" Gaceta m\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico  57.

Otherwise, he concluded, these schools would only graduate \u201cm\u00e9dicos de pacotilla\u201d \n[literally, rubbish doctors], \u201cincomplete physicians\u201d whose lack of thorough knowledge of \nmedicine would make them kill rather than heal patients . He even recalled a case in the USA, \nwhere institutions turned \u201cin one or two years the illiterate son of a central -American\u201d into a \nmedical doctor. This last statement is telling about the implicit classism that underlay his \ndiscourse about adequate medi cal training.51  \nThe tradition of ENM faculty and graduates not directly attacking homeopathy and \nLavalle\u2019s requirement of a big investment to fund a worthy private medical school suggest that \nLavalle might have been openly aware of the ELHM and that he was  being politically correct \nwhen he did not specifically refer to it. In his critique , he described problems that the  school was \nalready facing in 1913. For instance, his comment about the impossibility of funding a private \nmedical school through an unsalar ied faculty and a hundred -student pop ulation paying 5 pesos a \nmonth \u2014 as the Free School of Law\u2019s faculty and st udents funded their institution \u2014 was also \napplicable to the ELHM, though the latter was in a much worse situation since students paid an \nannual  fee of 2 pesos. And his description of students at such institutions as \u201cilliterate\u201d mimicked \nManuell\u2019s depiction of homeopaths .52  \nHiginio P\u00e9rez, founder of the ELHM, regarded this school as a motor of social \ntransformation that benefited Mexican society.  At th is school,  orthodox homeopathy, which \nP\u00e9rez regarded as scientific medicine, transformed working class individuals into professionals \n                                                             \n51 Lavalle y Carbajal, \"Historia de la medicina en M\u00e9xico.

E. Manuell to refer specifically to homeopaths as one of the specific plagues that \u201ccorrode d the \nnation\u201d. See Manuell, \"DISCURSO pronunciado por su autor, en la sesi\u00f3n celebrada en el anfiteatro de la \nEscuela Preparatoria, el 6 de marzo de 1912.\"  130 \n with a medical degree. In his view homeopathic science was a tool for class mobility , a tool to \nredeem the working c lass. In a speech addressed to ELHM students, he acknowledged that the \nschool was blamed for hosting \u201cmasons, shoemakers, and the working class\u201d, and \u201cimprovising \nprofessional [doctors]\u201d with deficient medical training . But he motivated students by \nhighlig hting the  school\u2019s  democratic ethos. The school \u201cwas open to any person without any \nclass distinction who wanted to learn\u201d, he said, because \u201cscience was not a privilege of the \nwealthy\u201d. He believed that there was more pride in the transformation of workin g-class students \ninto professionals who looked after their fellows than in training more \u201cwise\u201d doctors as the \nENM did. He compared the school to \u201ca forge that tempered [student\u2019s] spirits, and forged [their] \ncharacter\u201d, in order to turn them into \u201cmodest practitioners\u201d. He considered that there was no \nlack of planning in the school\u2019s way of training, for small groups and closer interaction with \nfaculty improved students\u2019 academic performance.53 \nHiginio P\u00e9rez \u2019s adaptation of his homeopathic school to provide  medical training to the \nworking class attracted larger amounts of students than the ENMH  did. The former enrolled 31 \nstudents in 1913 .54 In 1916, the ELHM graduated 16 students, while the ENMH graduated only 5 \n(Graph 1). Even five years after Porragas modi fied the ENMH curriculum with the promise of \nfederal funding, the ENMH la gged  behind. In 1921, 20 students graduated from the ELHM , \nwhile no ne graduated from the ENMH  (see Graph 1). The ELHM became the most important \nprovider of homeopathic doctors in Mexi co City in the early 1920s and 30s. Eventually, its \nconspicuous presence pushed the Department of Public Health (see chapter 4  and 5 ) and the \nMinistry of Public Education (see below) to regulate its practice and training. But in the early \n1920s the focus of regulation of medical training was the ENMH.  \n                                                             \n53 See Francois -Flores, La Escuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda   21-23. \n54 \u201cHistorias Academicas de medicos de la ELH\u201d and \u201cRegistro general de medicos y parteras de la \nELHM, 1916 -1949\u201d in AHELHM.  131 \n  0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 \n1896  \n1898  \n1890  \n1902  \n1904  \n1906  \n1908  \n1910  \n1912  \n1914  \n1916  \n1918  \n1920  \n1922  \n1924  \n1926  \n1928  \n1930  \n1932  \n1934  \n1936  \n1938  \n1940  \n1942  Number of Graduates  \nYears  Graph 1: Graduates from Homeopathic Medical \nSchools, 1896 -1942  \nGraduates from Escuela Nacional de Medicina Homeopatica (ENMH)  \nGraduates from other national and foreign homeopathic schools  \nGraduates from Escuela Libre de Homepatia de Mexico (ELHM)  \nNotes:  Other national instituions that granted homeopathic titles were the Government of the State of Yucat\u00e1n, the  \nNational University of the Southwest at Yucat\u00e1n (which later on would become the School of Homeopathic \nMedicine of Yucat\u00e1n), and the Homeopathic School of Jalisco.

Though widely \nknown as a reformer whose interventions incorporated the native population into a national \nmestizo culture, Vasconcelos\u2019 reforms also impacted pro fessional education. The UNM became a \nrevolutionary institution of the people and for the people, under his lead ership . Administratively, \nhe transformed the university into the Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica [Ministry of Public \nEducation, SEP], a change t hat signaled his priorities. Yet the privileged position of the \nuniversity within the new office placed it over other professional schools, i.e. free schools, as a \ncenter from which the state could start to regulate professional education in the 1920s .55 These \nchanges  also impacted schools of homeopath y too. \nJos\u00e9 Vasconcelos was interested in the status of both homeopathic schools and requested \nan evaluation that contrasted the national one and the free one . Dr. Gildardo G\u00f3mez and \nEngineer Fortunato Dozal\u2019s noted that both institutions lacked facilities t o provide hands -on \nexperience for students, which in turn ma de these schools rely too much o n lectures . Compared \nto each other, the ENMH\u2019s \u201csmall\u201d facilities \u201cwithout any pedagogic plan\u201d made it less suitable  \nfor professional medical training.56 In a similar fashion, Dr. Donato Moreno criticized the \ncurricula and pedagogic methods of state -regulated schools in general and those of the ENMH in \nparticular as  \n                                                             \n55 At this moment the issue about how to, if so, regulate professional practice was still under discussion. \nAttempts to regulate artic le 4 of the constitution which provided the liberty of professions had been \nundertaken with no success. This situation made the NUM an institution that aimed to regulate \nprofessional education in Mexico, but without any legal foundations. For a detail anal ysis of the \nregulation of professions see chapter 4.  \n56 The report is dated on September 15, 1920. In the case of the ENMH, it highlighted the actual situation \nof the school its facilities and academic curriculum. At this moment the school had 51 students enrolled. \nThey counted a total of 77 graduates up to 1920 with a rate of graduation of 3 per year. Gildardo G\u00f3mez \nand Fortunato Dozal, \"Sr. Rector de la Universidad Nacional,\" Escuela Libre  I.8 (1921).  133 \n encyclopedic, preserving the Comtean system which has been totally abandoned \nin the civilized world because it only produced erudite and pedantic people who \nlack[ed] practical competence [\u2026. These school\u2019s educational] system lack[ed] \nany practical studies to produce  real abilities and knowledges.57 \n \nIn contra st, G\u00f3mez and Dozal\u2019s report praised the medical facilities and training at the \nELHM .58 G\u00f3mez and Dozal described ELHM\u2019s facilities as better in terms of size and \norganization. ELHM classrooms were large, well-ventilated , and well -illuminated, and different  \nschool\u2019s sections were separated o n different floor s. The ELHM also had a library. The report \nargued that while ELHM only provid ed courses essential to become a homeopathic medical \ndoctor, the schools curricular content and strcutrue had the advantage of avoiding a course \noverload that produced mediocre doctors. Dr. Moreno praised ELHM\u2019s pedagogic methodology  \nfro training students to use their \u201cown senses\u201d rather than \u201cmemorizing\u201d to build up their own \nmedical experience. \u201cTheir knowledge might be limited,  but it is real\u201d, he said. Moreover, \nstudents\u2019 enthusiasm and the faculty\u2019s personalized attention helped overcome any school\u2019s \nmaterial deficiency, he concluded.59 \nRegardless of ELHM\u2019s limited infrastructure and the consequential limited practice that \nstudents had and that G\u00f3mez and Dozal acknowledged, the report highlighted the effort of \nproviding medical training without state support, and suggested that the school would provide \nadequate training if the UNM inspected it regularly. Dr. Moreno requested that the UNM offer at \nleast a one -time stipend to reward the effort of the private homeopathic school. Vasconcelos \n                                                             \n57 He introduced himself as Professor of Natural Histor y, Psychology, and Logic in a High School in \nZacatecas; professor of Descriptive Anatomy, Surgical Clinics, and Surgical Therapeutics at the ENM; \nand founder of and professor of Surgical Therapeutics at the Medical School of the Army. Donato \nMoreno, \"Mi op ini\u00f3n sobre las escuelas homeop\u00e1ticas, libre y nacional, formada conmotivo de las visitas \nque a las referidas escuelas hicimos los se\u00f1ores ingeniero Dosal y doctor G\u00f3mez con el subscripto,\" \nEscuela Libre  I.8 (1921).  \n58 The report also highlighted the differences in the population each school served. These figures are \nsimilar to the ones I already analyzed in this chapter. THE ELHM quadrupled the population of enrolled \nstudents. 50 students had graduated from the ELHM, m aking a graduation rate of 13 per year.  \n59 G\u00f3mez and Dozal, \"Sr. Rector de la Universidad Nacional.\"  134 \n empathized with such arguments, and though he could not offer financial or material support, he \nagreed to send inspectors to the school or to op en courses at the UNM so that ELHM\u2019s students \ncould complete their training .60 Moreover, he brought the discussion about adequate training to \nregulation when he stated that ELHM medical degrees \u201cshould have\u201d at least the same status as \nthe ones from the ENM H, because both schools had a similar curriculum. This was more of a \npersonal opinion than  a feasible statement, for while in constitutional terms the  degrees might \nhave the same status, state institutions and social elites valued official degrees over any  others \n(see chapter 4).  \nVasconcelos decided to incorporate the ENMH into the UNM two months after the \nreport .61 He might have been influenced by the school\u2019s poor infrastructure or Porragas\u2019 \ndemands for funds, yet it is more likely that his interest laid in the organization of already \nexisting state professional training institutions under the newly created Secretaria de Educacion \nPublica  [SEP, Ministry of Public Education]  rather than the technical needs of particular medical \nschools. Once hosted by the UNM, the ENMH began to receive funds and improve its facilities \nand curricular structure, just as Porragas had promised four years earlier.62 Six months after its \nincorporati on, the school had new facilities and material resources for the library and the \n                                                             \n60 Transcription of a correspondence from Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos to the ELHM circa 1920 in response to the \nreports provided by Dr. Gildardo G\u00f3mez and Eng.

He \norganized his faculty to \u201creform\u201d the academic curriculum ,64 though he reported that al most all \nclasses in the school\u2019s curriculum already offered practical activities .65 For instance, J. M. \nCarrera, Professor of Physiology, reported several practic al sessions on the effects of gastric \nsubstances, digestion, and the use of instruments to meas ure heart rate. Isaac Jim\u00e9nez, Professor \nof Topographic Anatomy, mentioned that all anatomical regions studied in class had been \nlocalized and dissected in c adavers .  Yet it seemed that resources were not enough  for in 1923 \n                                                             \n63 A new building to host the school was remodeled outside the homeopathic hospital during January and \nFebruary. The National Homeopathic Ho spital\u2019s was placed in what today is the street of Chimalpopoca \nat Ave  \nnida 5 de febrero, in Mexico City; and the school was moved to Puente de Alvarado, 78.

A library was build up \nfrom donations and new purchases. The library  received a thousand books from the hospital; Juan N. \nArriaga, editor of La homeopat\u00eda  and translator of several books written by American homeopaths, \ndonated 230 books, pamphlets and other publications; the school bought 27 books.

Jos\u00e9 G. Troncoso, professor of Descriptive \nAnatomy for nurses, brought his students to six dis sections performed by the professor of the class, \nAntonio Orozco; Juan N.

Was Porragas requesting more funds in a veiled fashion? Or did faculty reports \noverstate their resources and practical pedagogic methodology? Why would Porragas request an \nincreased budget when the number of enrolled students did not increase when the UNM took \nover the administration of the ENMH?  \nSimilar concerns rose am ong ENM faculty who complained about irregularities in the \nhomeopathic school and its high budge t/student  ratio. In December 1920, an anonymous author \ncomplained in the Gaceta M\u00e9dica Mexican a about the irregularities at the ENMH. He reported \nthat a \u201cmonthly budget of $8, 900 was spent in the education of 22 students who attend the \nNational School of Homeopathy\u201d , that \u201c[a person was] listed as professor and student at the same \ntime, [and  that] veterinarians who lacked a job and due to the promotion of homeopathy [were] \nstudying homeopathy.\u201d67 Manuel Godoy, professor of Surgical Therapeutics at the ENM, argued \nthat investing in a school that \u201conly trained twenty something students\u201d was \u201cunnecessar y and \nhence superfluous\u201d, and that such funding would be better used to improve ENM facilities and \nthe Medical School of the Army .68 The budget of each medical school at the university was \ncalculated according to student enrollment, but even if such differences were taken into account, \nENMH  students \u2019 costs were as high as twice for ENM  students\u2019 .69  \n                                                             \n66 See \"Escuela Nacional de Medicina H omeop\u00e1tica,\" Bolet\u00edn de la Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica  I.3 \n(1923): 146.   \n67 See \"Sr. J.

The first semester of 1923 each school had 1702 \nand 161 students, 342 a nd 61 personnel amongst administrative staff and faculty, who received a total of 137 \n ENM\u2019s faculty discomfort lay  in havin g lost the privileged position that their school h eld \nin previous government administration s, both during the Porfiriato  and after the revolution. For \ninstance , Godoy\u2019s main concern was that Jose Vasconcelos\u2019 sponsorship reproduce d the same \nirregularities as during the Porfiriato , when the Minister of the Interior pressed state governors to \npay students from the countryside to study at the ENMH  or allowe d students who had not \nfinished their high -school to enroll in this school.70 Godoy suspicions were sounde d for i n the \nsame journal where he published his critique , anonymous authors report ed Vasconcelos \u2019 \nkeenness to patronize students from Cent ral America to study medicine at  the ENM. 71 \nVasconcelos did more than divert SEP\u2019s funds to Central American students . His concern to turn \nthe SEP into an institution that provided education to the popular classes made him withheld \nresources that ENM faculty believed necessary to improve medical training at their school. For \ninstance, Vasconcelos refused to fund the cons truction of a new building for the ENM in the \nearly 1920s. He believed that the Palace of the Inquisition, the building that hosted the school , \nprovided the space needed to carry out medical training . He argued that the SEP had broadened \nthe scope of publi c education, but that in order for the government office to commit to the \npromotion of culture amongst Mexican people, it was necessary that the medical profession \nfunded the construction of the new facilities.  His anit -elitist position led Vasconcelos say  that \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n295,609 and 56,290 in salaries, respectively. These figures indicate that the state invested an average of \n447.04 pesos per student at the ENM and 777.27 pesos per student at  the ENMH from 1922 to mid -1923. \nThe cost to educate homeopaths was twice as much as that for allopaths, despite the increase of ENMH \nstudent\u2019s population and lower salaries paid to ENM faculty.

When the ENMH became \none of the medical schools within the university, Manuel Godoy initiated a campaign to discredit \nhomeopaths\u2019 status as medical doctors, actualizing 19th-century critiques about homeopaths \nlacking medical training . For him homeopaths \u2019 sectarian approach inclined them to discredit true \nmedical science in fa vor of their sectarian approach, leading them into a poor medical criterion. \nGodoy noted that because of their  \nblind faith, truly sectarian, in the Hahnemann \u2019s system, [professors of the ENMH] \ndid not consider truly necessary the deep study of topics that  constituted \ntraditional medicine, and if they taught them, it [was] because they were obliged \nby law. It was understandable [hence\u2026] that these topics received very secondary \nattention, as they considered them inferior  and opposite to their system.73 \n \nEven  worse for Godoy was that as clinical practice was undertaken at the homeopathic hospital \nwhere only homeopathic methods were taught, students were left without any  exposure to the \npractice of allopathic therapeutics.  \nAt the institutional level, he accuse d homoeopaths of usurping the place that graduates \nfrom ENM should have. Not having the proper medical training, homeopaths prescribed \nmedications they were not trained to use, and they advertised their services as medical doctors, \nnever mentioning that th ey were homeopaths. To solve this situation, Godoy proposed that \nhomeopaths undert ake the curriculum as the rest of students of medicine did at the ENM; that the \nENMH be closed and its funds reassigned to the ENM in order to improve medical education at \none single professional medical school; and that special courses of homeopathy be offered at the \n                                                             \n72 See Excelsior , March 14, 1923, cited in Bolet\u00edn de la Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica .

Was Godoy accurate in his critique of the ENMH or was he only \nreproducing a common trope about homeopathic medical training amongst his pro fessional \npeers? In other words, w ere ENMH faculty as sectarian as, for instance, Higinio P\u00e9rez?  \nThe discussion about hands -on experience in medical training flooded the discourse of \nmedical school authorities in the 1920s .74 Under Carranza\u2019s administration , Dr. Amo r, the \nENM\u2019s d ean (1916 \u201320), modified the academic curriculum and made practical classes  \nmandatory , clearly establishing the number of classes in each course and the minimum that a \nstudent should attend in order to be examined in a specific course. He a lso named faculty \nresponsible for  laboratories and dissection rooms t o coordinat these classes. When Dr. Guillermo \nParra replaced Dr. Amor in May 1920, he continued to promot e the school\u2019s growth by \nincreasing the number of faculty, opening new  clinical classes, and expanding the school\u2019s \ninfrastructure.75 Since Porragas had used the ENM\u2019s academic curriculum as  a model to improve \nthe ENMH\u2019s, both medical schools\u2019 curricula were essentially the same in the early 1920s. When \nclosely analyzed, figu res show that the ENM offered slightly more practical courses, particularly \nin anatomy, pathology and clinical practice (See Table 1). The ENMH\u2019s curriculum offered one \ncourse more of therapeutics and one more of material medica , keeping the same emphasis on \nthese topics as in previous years. In order to accommodate such a curricular load, the ENM took \nsix years to graduate a student, while the ENMH needed only five. The total number of courses \n                                                             \n74 Dr. Enrique Herrera Moreno offered an analysis of the changes in the academic curriculum of the ENM \nsince the creation of the school in 1833 to the early 1920s where he criticized the lack of emphasis of \nphysiological know ledge, particularly during the 20th century. Herrera Moreno, \"La Escuela de Medicina \nde M\u00e9xico.\"  Dr. Fernando Ocaranza, who was secretary of the ENM from 1921 to 1923 and director from \n1924 to 1934, held a similar opinion. See, for instance, Fernando Ocara nza, Breve historia de la Facultad \nde Medicina  (M\u00e9xico: Alcal\u00e1 y Gonz\u00e1lez, 1939) 28 -30.; and Fernando Ocaranza, Historia de la medicina \nen M\u00e9xico  (M\u00e9xico: Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes, 1995) 201 -2. For him, the \n\u201cphysiological thought\u201d \u2013the one that Claude Bernard introduced to medicine - had to be central in the \nENM\u2019s academic curriculum if it wanted to belong to the group of most advanced medical schools in the \nworld.  \n75 Ocaranza, Breve historia de la Facultad de Medicina   29-30. 140 \n offered by the ENM and the ENMH was 39 and 28, respectively. Wh ile some of the ENM \ncourses, such as logic and medical morality, did not require any practical instruction, in general \nthis school offered more practical training contrasted to the homeopathic one. There is no \nevidence that indicates that ENMH faculty was sectarian as Godoy critiqued. Moreover, \nPorragas\u2019 willingness to modify the ENMH curriculum in 1916 indicates otherwise. Yet, as \nG\u00f3mez and Dozal report ed and as Moreno\u2019s letter indicated before Godoy, it seemed that ENMH \nstudents received less practical tr aining than their counterparts at the ENM .  \nBy incorporating the ENMH into the university, Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos achieved the central \nregulation of all professional medical schools with the consequential improvement of ENMH\u2019s \nfacilities and curriculum. His inte nded administrative centralization did not imply doctrina ire \ncommunion between the two medical schools within the university. On the contrary , the rhetoric \nof ENM\u2019s faculty to discredit ENMH\u2019s medical training was intertwined with the former\u2019s \ninability to  monopolize state -supported medical training, which perpetuated what Quevedo y \nZubieta called in 1895 the \u201cbifurcation of science\u201d. But through further administrative reforms, \nENM\u2019s faculty took the opportunity to merge the ENMH to the ENM and transform th e official \ndegree of homeopathic medical doctor into a medical specialty. With it, ENM\u2019s model of \nmedical training became the one sanctioned by the state and hence the \u201cofficial\u201d one.  \nPresident \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n \u2019s decree of October 9, 1923, ordered the incor poration of the \nhomeopathic school into the ENM, arguing that ENMH students would benefit from adequate \npractical medical training at the ENM and that the ongoing administration would reduce the \nbudget allocated to state -funded medical schools .76 But the no tion of \u201cincorporation\u201d was \n                                                             \n76 Savings we re around 100, 000 pesos to train 40 students of homeopathy. See Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n, Acuerdo \nNum. 4230 de fecha 9 de octubre d e 1923 del C. Presidente de la republica, Copy of the presidential \nagreement where \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n decrees the unification of the Schoo l of Homeopathic Medicine to the \nFaculty of Medicine, AHUNAM, ENAE, 8, 161, p. 5  141 \n contested and highly negotiated by authorities of both medical schools during the discussions \nthat planned how to actually implement the presidential decree before the effective date of \nJanuary 1, 1924 .77 During the negotiations,  there was a clear intention to offer both medical \nmajors \u2014 homeop athic doctor and medical doctor \u2014 within the ENM. In the presidential decree, \n\u201cincorporation\u201d of the ENMH originally meant a more efficient use of material resources within \nthe university. B ut the timing of discussions within the University Council that planned the \nmerger, the willingness of ENM faculty to unify medical training, and the willingness of ENMH \nfaculty and students to be acknowledged both as true scientific physicians and as an independent \nacademic group led homeopaths to lose the school that distinguish ed them as a parallel medical \nprofession.  \nThe timing of academic reforms suggests that Bernardo Gast\u00e9lum, SEP\u2019s vice -president \nand also a medical doctor, sided with ENM faculty, w ho in turn used their privileged position \n                                                             \n77 There were multiple reactions from the medical community which tried to change the Presidential \ndecision. While they eventually succeeded, discussions in the University Coun cil were already taking \nplace and President Obreg\u00f3n did nothing to stop them. Rafael Colom\u00e9, Jos\u00e9 D. Conde and Alonso V. \nGamboa, president, vice -president, and member, respectively, of the Sociedad M\u00e9dico -homeop\u00e1tica de \nYucat\u00e1n  sent a telegram to the Presi dent requesting that the ENMH remained independent because the \nidea of merging training in both medical approaches was unattainable and because the entire scientific \nworld possessed an academic representation of homeopathy. So did Miguel R. Zece\u00f1a and E. C asta\u00f1on \nRinc\u00f3n, president and secretary of the Sociedad de estudiantes de la ENMH , who requested \u00c1lvaro \nObreg\u00f3n that he kept the school independent. President conceded and through his minister of the interior \nhe let faculty of the ENMH know that he would reconsider his decision if they decided to offer their \nservices without payment, a s faculty had done it during the Porfiriato. Faculty agreed, and they formed a \ncommission to discuss the proposal. Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n authorized homeopaths\u2019 proposition, but the \npolitical turmoil of the presidential succession prevented it from taking place. I n contrast to homeopaths \nreactions, C. Viesca y Lobat\u00f3n and F. Z\u00e1rraga, president and secretary of the AMM, congratulated \nPresident Obreg\u00f3n for his decision. See Alonso V.

He, Manuel Gea Gonz\u00e1lez, ENM\u2019s Dean, and \nEzequiel A. Ch\u00e1vez, UNM\u2019s Chancellor, design ed this curriculum with no ENMH -faculty \nparticipation. A week  later, Gast\u00e9lum submitted a new reformed curriculum for the ENM, which \ncoincidentally was the same as the one proposed for the ENMH with the exception of the \nhomeopathic courses (See Table 1, year 1920 \u20134, ENM, 1924). The University Council originally \ncreated a commission with two members from ENM faculty and the ENMH Dean to evaluate the \nnew curriculum for the ENMH, but the new curriculum for the ENM demanded a bigger \ncommission to evaluate both. Consequently the Council added the ENM secretary and the ENM  \nDean to the original commission, increasing the already unbalanced ENM -to-ENMH -faculty \nratio.79 \n Political timing and professional antipathies also played an important role during these \nnegotiations. Taking advantage of timing, the commission to evaluate c urricular reforms took \nthree weeks to bring back its resolution to the University Council, and in the session of \nDecember 14, 1923, Gea Gonz\u00e1lez, president of the commission, requested an extra week to \nsubmit the final report .80 By early January 1924, when the University Council started to discuss \nthe commission\u2019s report, the ENMH no longer existed as an independent institution in the \nuniversity and consequently did not have representation in the council .81 Although the council \n                                                             \n78 See Acts of the University Council, November 14th, 1923,  in \u201c21a.

The commission\u2019s report empha sized that due to his absence at  meeting s, the \ncommission had had to analyze the new ENMH curriculum without any input from \nrepresentatives of that school .83 Revolving around the prejudice that homeopaths rejected the \nunity of medical science when they offered medical training of their own, ENM f aculty proposed \nin their report that students of both medical degrees undertook the same courses on medical \nsciences and that special homeopathic courses were created for those who wanted to pursue the \ndegree of homeopathic doctor.  \nSuch a plan still kept t he degree of homeopathic doctor as distinct from that of medical \ndoctor even within the ENM, but the lack of activism of ENMH faculty and students within the \nUniversity Council84 and their alignment with ENM faculty\u2019s ideology led to the merger of both \ncurricula and degrees into one and turn ed homeopathy into a medical specialty. Despite the \nUniversity Council\u2019s invitation, Porragas did not attend the sessions when the report was read \nand discussed .85 In contrast, Miguel F. Bachiller, ENMH\u2019s professor of micr obiology, and \nAbelardo Mart\u00edn Novelo, an ENMH student, did attend, but their opinions favored the \n                                                             \n82 The proposal to consider the voice of ENMH faculty came from Dean Ezequiel A. Ch\u00e1vez. Gea \nGonz\u00e1lez intervened to ratify that he would agreed on the proposition if ENMH faculty and students were  \nallowed to offer their opinion but not to vote any resolution. Dean Ch\u00e1vez acknowledged that even if he \nwanted them to vote, that was not possible due to UNM legislation.  \n83 See Dictamination of the new study programs for undergraduate studies in Medicine  and Homeopathy \nin \u201cDictamen \u201d, AHUNAM, CU, 13, 92, 1233.  \n84 ENMH faculty and students and other homeopathic organizations did pursued activism but not within \nthe university. They rather addressed personally President Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n. Alonso V.

For instance, Miguel Bachiller believed in the \n\u201cuniqueness\u201d of medical scientific courses, in the \u201cscientific education  of the youth\u201d, and in the \nneed to \u201cbe first a scientific doctor\u201d before \u201cprescribing globules\u201d.86 Students of homeopathy \nwere concerned about studying at an institution where homeopathy raised profound antipathies \nand let Fernando Ocaranza, a member of the  commission, know about their concern .87 Believing \nthat such animosity might bring disciplinary problems within the ENM, Ocaranza seconded \nENMH students\u2019 request for teaching homeopathy as a medical specialty in the Escuela \nNacional de Altos Estudios [Gradu ate School], just like other medical specialties were taught. \nWith no objections from the University Council, the commission decided to modify the original \nreport, turning the ENM into the single medical school within the university responsible for \ntraining medical doctors.  \nThe seemingly consensual decision that unified medical training at the ENM and placed \nthis school as the single institution that granted official medical degrees in Mexico City was a \nconsequence of different trends in government adminis tration, the persistence of ENM faculty to \nuse a unilateral view of science to monopolize state support and unify medical curricula and \nschools, and a shift in ENMH faculty \u2019s perce ptions of homeopathic training . Central regulation \nstarted when D\u00edaz require d the ENMH to have the same curriculum as the ENM. Social and \npolitical revolts precluded the UNM from organizing and centraliz ing professional education, \nand when Vasconcelos resumed such efforts in 1920, the ENMH stood as a minor budget -\nconsuming school in contrast to the ENM. ENM faculty took advantage of their institutional \nposition to implement their plans to get rid of the ENMH and consolidate the ENM as the single \nofficial medical school. A new generation of homeopaths who had been trained jus t as their \n                                                             \n86 See \u201c 33a. Sesi\u00f3n. \u201d \n87 Both Abelardo Mart\u00edn Novelo and the Society of Students of the ENMH had addressed the University \nChancellor and Fernando Ocaranza before the council\u2019s meeting to let them know this concern.  145 \n ENM peers appropriated the marginalizing discourse of ENM faculty, reducing homeopathy to a \ntherapeutic system whose particular views of disease and the body were subsumed to modern \nscientific ones.   \nBachiller and Mart\u00edn Novelo\u2019s opinions show that EN MH faculty and students had \nforgotten ENMH \u2019s original ideal of training the working class and instead appropriated the \naspirations of medical elites .88 As such they aligned with administrative centralization, but \ndetach ed from the revolutionary ideal of providing education to those who had no access to it. \nPorragas, his staff, and students aimed to participate in  the professional, economic, and social \nbenefits that ENM -graduated medical doctors enjoyed and that Vasconcelos  so harshly criticized. \nIn contrast, the ELHM brought medical training to those who could not study at the UNM, \nfulfilling the revolutionary ideal with which Vasconcelos was infusing the university. The \nELHM received positive comments from different sector s of the society, from ministers to ENM \ngraduates, from legislators to Supreme Court ministers . All of them praised the school\u2019s effort as \na private institution which \u201crelieved the government from university education so it can dedicate \nits economic effort s to educate the masses who are less privileged to pursue academic studies\u201d ,89 \nas J. M Puig Casauranc, Vasconcelos\u2019 successor as Minister of the SEP, commented; or its \norganization, effort, and willingly action, despite their poor resources. As these commen ts, \nG\u00f3mez and Dozal\u2019s report,  and Moreno\u2019 letter show, the EL MH was positioned as a medical \n                                                             \n88 For instance, Godoy criticized ENMH graduates for changing adve rtisements outside their consulting \noffices to include a note that said they belong to school of the UNM. Godoy \u00c1lvarez, \"Con motivo de la \nincorporaci\u00f3n de la Escuela Nacional de Homeopat\u00eda en el Departamento Universitario,\" 3.  \n89 Francois -Flores gathered a  series of positive comments to the ELHM in \u201cEl Libro de Oro\u201d in Francois -\nFlores, La Escuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda   15 - 18. These comments came from Carlos B. Zetina (1918), J. \nM Puig Casauranc, Dr. J.

In the \nbrochure that explained the curricul ar changes in 1925, he displayed the characteristics that made \nhis medical school distinctive. He plainly and openly opposed \u201cofficial\u201d medical training. His \ncurriculum and pedagogic methodology emphasized a low course load, providing only the \nindispensabl e theoretical content. Instead professors gave students elements that prepared them \nto do their own research and find answers to their own medical inquiries. The core of Higinio\u2019s \napproach was the human being; \u201cthe healthy man is and will always be the mea sure and base of \ncomparison in all medical speculation\u201d, he wrote.91 Higinio P\u00e9rez\u2019s rhetoric attempted to \ndisqualify science -based medical training at the ENM by turning upside down ENM\u2019s faculty \n                                                             \n90 Higinio P\u00e9rez\u2019s exortation to his students.

P\u00e9rez, \"Programas y m\u00e9todos de ense\u00f1anza de la Escuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda y \npreparatoria anexa,\"  (J. L. Mu\u00f1oz, 1925), vol., 3 -11.  147 \n own discourse. What for the latter seemed modern and scienti fic medicine, i.e. microbiology and \nphysiology, for the former was no more than a medical training that missed the focus of \nmedicine. What for the latter seemed advanced laboratory practices, for the  former was no more \nthan routinarian observations that mi ssed the key of medical training, the patient . By placing \nELHM\u2019s pedagogical approach over ENM\u2019s, Higinio P\u00e9rez put the former in competition with \nthe latter, ideologically turning the ELHM into what ENM\u2019s faculty was trying to get rid of at the \nUNM in 192 4. \nRegardless of its pedagogic methodology, ELHM\u2019s curricular structure did change from \n1913 to 1933 (See Table 1), increasingly resembling ENM\u2019s by  1933. With new reforms, P\u00e9rez \nadded courses on b asic and medical sciences such p harmacopeia, biochemistry, and bacteriology, \nin 1925, and physiotherapy, psychiatry, parasitology and physiological pathology, in 1933. These \ncourses had generally been first included by t he ENM, though others, such as p hysiotherapy and \nhygiene, had first been included in homeopathic curricula. The ELHM offered more courses in \ntherapeutics and fewer in  clinical practices and courses of specialization than the ENM, though it \nhad extended the time -span for medical studies to five years. But as with former reforms, the \nsimilar structure differed in terms of extent, or in other words, how many courses were dedicated \nto each topic. While these differences were justified by Higinio\u2019s particular training perspective, \nthey also indicate d his own tendency to equate the ELHM\u2019s acad emic curriculum with the \nENM\u2019s. These differences were  less radical compared to the ones of the early 1910s, and would \nbecome even less distinctive in the 1930s. The convergence of all medical academic curricula \noffered by medical schools in Mexico City in  the 1930s suggests a general acknowledgment, \nregardless of doctrinarian views, that medical doctors, homeopaths and allopaths alike, needed to \nacquire a set of concepts and skills before they could be considered professional practitioners. 148 \n Differences sti ll existed in terms of amount of courses dedicated to a particular subject, but in \nterms of structure medical academic curricula were mainly the same. This confluence in the \nstructure of medical schools\u2019 academic curricula in Mexico City was a consequence of a new \nreconfiguration of the role of the state and the UNM  in professional education at the turn of the \n1930s.  \nThe ELHM achieved in the 1910s and the 1920s what the ENMH could not during the \nPorfiriato  and the first three decades of the 20th century. It turned into a medical school that \noffered training to those who could not afford an elite education at state institutions, shifting the \nlocus where homeopathic doctors were trained in Mexico City. It seemed that the sectarian and \nuplifting eth os and a working -class orientation with which Higinio P\u00e9rez imbued his medical \nschool attracted a larger and more committed student population, at least during the 1920s .92 The \nELHM graduated more students even after the ENMH was incorporated into the UNM : 22 and \n10, respectively , in 1924 (See Graph 1). The rate of graduation at the ELHM remained fairly \nconstant (13 graduates per year) without significant variations from 1916 to 1938. The ENMH\u2019s \nrate of graduation was 3.5 from 1895 to 1924 and 7.1 from 1928 to 1936 (See Graph 1)  \u2014 \nclearly  lower than the ELHM\u2019s. During the 1920s, the ELHM became the main provider of \nhomeopathic doctors for Mexico City and the whole country, and from 1924 to 1928, the only \nprovider . These figures changed in the 1930s. While the  ELHM\u2019s graduation rate remained \nsteady , and its graduates still remained the most important group of homeopathic doctors in the \ncountry throughout the 1940s, a new wave of state support reinsta ted the ENMH in an effort to \nprovide medical training to the w orking class at the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN). \nEventually this lead the ENMH to restore its original position during the Porfiriato  as the second \n                                                             \n92 Analysis of transcripts of the ELHM in the AHELHM.  149 \n most important school in Mexico City in terms of the quality of its facilities, the amount of \nfundi ng received, and the number of students graduated .  \n\u201cBuil[t] up on indestructible foundations\u201d: The Struggle to Introduce Scientific Medicine in \nSEP-Administered Homeopathic Medical Schools, 1928 \u201336 \nThe presidential succession of 1928 and the Maximato  (1928\u201334) brought a series of \ndrastic institutional rearrangements that impacted homeopathic schools. In the course of eight \nyears, the ENMH was re -insta ted as an official medical school (1928), the SEP -regulated free \nschools \u2019 and ELHM\u2019s medical degrees became official (1930), and the ENMH became a \nfounding school of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) (1936), a socialist project to bring \nprofessional education to the working -class initiated during the L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rde nas pres idential \nperiod (1934 \u201340). The volatile situation of homeopathic schools reflected tensions between the \nstate and the UNM that resulted in the displacement of the university as the regulatory office of \nprofessional education under SEP\u2019s control. From 1910 to 1925 the National University served \nthe needs of the state, as when it incorporated the ENMH, it closed the National School of High \nStudies, or when Vasconcelos denied funds for a new building for the ENM. Its position within \nthe SEP placed it over othe r professional schools ,93 but also subjected it to SEP\u2019s own budgetary, \nadministrative, and academic policies .94  By the end of the 1920s UNM\u2019s secondary role within \n                                                             \n93 For instance, during Calles administration (1924 -1928), he provided legisl ation that subsumed free \nschools under the rule of the university. In order to make their degrees legal, the UNM needed to evaluate \nand validate free schools\u2019 academic curricula. Otherwise graduates from free schools needed to pass an \nexamination in the un iversity in order to receive titles from it. See section VIII in the report from the \noffice of medical demography in the \u201cINFOMRE DEL DEPARTAMENTO DE SALUBRIDAD PARA \nEL MENSAJE PRESIDENCIAL DEL 1\u00ba DE SEPTIEMBRE DE 1925.\u201d, in the A HSS, SP, S, 9, 15.  \n94 With Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos as Dean (1920 -4), the University became a tool to develop the nationalistic and \nrevolutionary project of providing basic education to the entire nation, which meant the mobilization of a \nhuge amount of material and human resources to the c ountryside in order to reach the most economically \nunderserved sectors of the population. But professional education remained elitist and liberal; elitist, for \nonly the affluent sectors of the society, many of them living in urban centers, especially in Me xico City, \ncould afford this type of education, and liberal because it believed in its own academic and administrative \nself-governance. See Javier Mendoza Rojas, Los conflictos de la UNAM en el siglo XX , Colecci\u00f3n 150 \n the SEP reached a point of rupture and led to a conflict that concluded with the Portes Gil \nadministration (1928 \u201330) granting the university autonomy .95 With its autonomy earned, the \nuniversity turned into a professional institution similar to the other professional schools that \nexisted in Mexico City, at least in administrative terms, for it stop ped working as the regulatory \ncenter of professional education in the city. The new UNM\u2019s Organic Law proposed to gradually \nturn this institution into a private one without \u201cany right to impose its criteria in the evaluation of \nfree and private institution s that offered education similar to the one the university provided\u201d.96 \nMoreover, article 37 explicitly gave the responsibility to regulate free schools, validate their \ncurricula, and legalize their titles to the President of Mexico and the SEP .97 This radic al shift \nbrought regulation back to free schools, including the ELHM, in Mexico City.  \nRegulation of free schools was a political issue to undermine UNM status rather than an \neffort to improve education at these schools. While turning them into \u201cofficial\u201d i nstitutions \nimplied that the state was responsible for regulat ing their curricul a and the way they \nfunctioned ,98 the state did not provide any funds to cope with these schools\u2019 material needs.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nEducaci\u00f3n Superior Contempor\u00e1nea Serie May or, ed.

This history developed throughout the \n1920s and 1930s, sometimes through faculty demands, and sometimes through students\u2019 congresses or \nprotests. In 1928 new projects to attain the a utonomy were proposed, one by a students\u2019 association and \nthe other by the rector, Alfonso Pruneda, but none of them succeeded. In 1929, once Emilio Porte s Gil \ntook office, a minor conflict between university students and authorities escalated to the point where the \npublic force surreptitiously infiltrated the university campus, confronting a group of students that \nmanifested against them. President Portes G il\u2019s overreaction was caused by the political struggles \nbetween the ruling party and the party led by Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos, the one student leaders supported. The \nconflict turned into a general strike which Portes Gil solved by giving the National University i ts \nautonomy.

See Francois -Flores, La Escuela Libre de 151 \n President Portes Gil initiated the regulation of free schools af ter he solved the conflict with the \nUNM. The SEP positively evaluated medical studies at the ELHM during this transition , and \nwhile the school  suffered from some infrastructural deficiencies in the s urgery room and needed \nto meet specific hygienic requirem ents, the SEP believed that it would be ready to provide \nadequate medical training once it improved its condition .99 The decree that regulated the ELHM \non January 1930 stated that the school could \u201cfreely formulate its curriculum, programs, and \nteaching met hods; but in order to modify the ones currently used it most notify the SEP\u201d ,100 \nthough it imposed a curricular structure. Just as D\u00edaz did almost three decades earlier  with the \nENMH, this decree listed the courses that each student needed to take in order to obtain a \nhomeopathic medical degree, but on this occasion, these courses followed the ELHM curriculum \nof 1925 rather than the ENM\u2019s. Besides requiring the school to  graduate students in no less than \n4 years, the decree imposed no more regulations.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nHomeopat\u00eda   89-95.

While these \nreforms preserved t he school\u2019s particular view of medicine and homeopathy, the slight change in \nthe thematic content indicated a shift towards introducing basic sciences and medical specialties \ninto the curriculum and using such changes to publicize the ELHM as a modern medi cal school. \nA pamphlet that publicized the school in 1935 preserved the same view regarding homeopathy, \npedagogic methodology, and curricular structure with which Higinio P\u00e9rez advertised the ELHM \nin the early 1920s .101 Yet pictures highlighted the school\u2019s modern facilities, in contrast to the \nones it offered in the late 1920s (See Figure 2 ).

These images and the courses \noffered in the curriculum of 1933 show that despite its particular view of medicine, ELHM \nadapted its curricular structure and facilities to provide its students with modern scientific \nknow ledges and practices that benefited their everyday medical practice. Other situations \ninfluenced the adoption of a scientific rhetoric to s howcase the ELHM to the public as a medical \nschool that offered modern medical training. Among these were a shift in leadership and a a \nlarge discrediting campaign during the early years of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas\u2019 administration , mounted \nby ENM graduates against homeopaths in the context of a new effort to reg ulate professions (See \nchapter 6 ). Higinio P\u00e9rez died in October 1929, and first -generation graduates headed the school \nduring the 1930s.  This new generation of homeopathic doctors as their doctrinaire peers from the \nENMH adopted medical science and displayed in the ELHM curriculum and pamphlets to place \nthis medical sc hool as a modern professional vis-\u00e0-vis the other two medical schools in Mexico \nCity, the ENM and the ENMH , in the early 1930s .  \nThe political turmoil during the Maximato  also resulted in the re -instatement of the \nENHM as a state -sponsored  option to train homeopathic doctors .102 The transformation of \nhomeopathy from a distinct major into a medical specialty did not help homeopathy endure \nwithin the UNM in 1924. ENM faculty designed the specialty\u2019s curricular content, eliminating \nall doctrin aire content from i t, though ENMH graduates were responsible for teach ing the \nspecialty .103 However, the specialty did not last longer than a year .104 Calles\u2019 1928 decree argued \n                                                             \n102 See \"Decreto por el cual se establece la carrera de M\u00e9dico Cirujano Home\u00f3pata,\" Diario Oficial  1928, \nOrgano del gobierno constitucional de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, Febrero 3, 2014, \n<http://www.dof.gob.mx/index.php?year=1928&month=03&day=12>.7  \n103 Pharmacopo eia, Pharmacodynamics, Homeopathic Therapy, and Philosophy of Medicine Especially of \nHomeopathy were the courses that finally constituted the specialty\u2019s curriculum, substituting, Materia \nmedica and Homeopathic Doctrine, original courses which provided the  core ideology of homeopathy. 154 \n that \u201cthe way in which the [UNM] decided how to teach Homeopathic Medicine neither \nfacilitated nor or iented students enrolled in the [ENM] towards homeopathy, which resulted in \nthe total lack of homeopathy students at this school.\u201d105 This might seem contradictory to \nBachiller and Novelo\u2019s position in 1924, which contributed to the fate of the ENMH within t he \nUNM. But the homeopathic community in general wanted the homeopathic school to thrive as an \nindependent institution. At the time of the merger, faculty and students sought support from \nforeign and national homeopathic institutions, which responded offer ing venues through which \nENMH students could continue studying at a homeopathic medical school .106 Consequently, \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nThis shift framed homeopathy as a pharmaceutical specialty, a particular way of ministering drugs, rather \nthan a medical approach with its own particular view of medicine.

For instance Manuel Cece\u00f1a Quiroz bitterly \ncomplained about the lack of awareness of homeopathic theories by ENM\u2019s professors when he studied \nmedicine in the mid -1920s, and he remembered their constant mocking of homeopathy during his years as \nstudent.

In response, students and professors initiated a series of denunciations, which \nauthorities \u2019 reports corroborated, about how for the sake of his own particular benefit G\u00f3mez \nEsparza\u2019s monopolistic administrative practices attempted to \u201cdeviate from the hospital\u2019s \nspecific medical approach\u201d , that is, to support surgical rather than homeopathic therapeutic \ninterventions .111  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nthe Head of the Office of Public Welfare, May 28, 1929 and July 9, 1929, in AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 4, \np. 2 and 5.  \n109 A report from the Head of the Medical Department of the Office of Publi c Welfare stated that he had \nreports about the undesirable workings of the school.

While there are reasons to believe that he \nmismanaged school\u2019s funds115 and created group of interest within the HNH ,116 these accusations \nmust be taken cautiously. There were students who argued that half of the sixteen students \nenrolled in the scho ol in 1930 were exempt from school fees and the other half did not pay fees \n                                                             \n114 According to the students\u2019 letter and oth er documents, students paid 30 pesos for enrolling fees, 10 \npesos each month for tuition, and 20 pesos for examination, making a total of 150 pesos a year.

At a certain point during the 1920s, \nboth medical staff and practitioners started receiving a stipend. In 1930, physicians and practitioners \nreceived 3 and 2 (pesos?) a day, respectively.

These \nstudents\u2019 denunciations mo st likely responded to their concern when they feel their source of income \nthreatened. Consequently, they might have overreacted in their statements. Yet, while G\u00f3mez Esparza and \nPorragas might have not mismanaged ENMH medical student fees, they might have  done it with ENMH \nnursing student fees. Plutarco El\u00edas Calles\u2019 decree authorized the creation of a nursing school within the \nENMH. Rather than ENMH medical students, it seemed that nursing ones paid fees without receiving a \ndegree after fulfilling all req uirements. The latter said they had paid $150 pesos in total and had not \nreceived their degree. See \u201cHacen graves cargos contra un secretario.

Further accusations of corruption came in 1932. \nThese exposed G\u00f3mez Esparza as a person who stole medical material from the homeopathic hospital to \nuse it in his private clinic. Moreover, nurses and administrative personnel accused him of using the \nhospital\u2019s surgery room for his private patients. See letters from nursing students and medical staff of the \nhomeopathic hospital in AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 24, pp. 24, 26, and 27.  \n116 Members of the Association of Surgeons of the National Homeopathic Hospital (see note 105) did not \ncomplain about G\u00f3mez Esparza\u2019s surgical tendencies. Moreover, they believed that his interventions were \nmotivated by hi s desire to improve the hospital and provide a better service to patients.

At least in the late 1910s the \nhomeopathic  community at state homeopathic institutions was united. In the 1930s the conflict \nwas located within homeopathic institutions and am ong ENMH graduates and students (G\u00f3mez \nEsparza graduated from the ENMH in 1923). G\u00f3mez Esparza\u2019s reforms might have been we ll \nintended, but his opinions negatively impacted the school. For instance, echoing G\u00f3mez \nEsparza \u2019s declarations, a journalist commented that \u201ca school of medicine which lacks \nmicroscopes to actually see bacteria, microtomes to do histological preparations , \nhaematocytometers to count red cells in blood samples, or dyes to find out the presence of the \ntuberculosis bacillus, should not exist.\u201d He also believed that the \u201cfaculty is naturally deficient  \nsince they do not receive a salary, and students have a poo r quality because they are rejects  from \nother schools\u201d.119  \nIn contrast to students\u2019 attitude s in the University\u2019s Council in 1924, this new generation \nactively protested against G\u00f3mez Esparza\u2019s reforms which diver ged from homeopathy and \nopposed the original intention for which the hospital was created.

It is \nunclear to what extent a strike in a school that did not receive state funds and had only 14 \nenrolled students might have exerted any political pressure to government authorities. But this \nthreat suggests students\u2019  political involvement in attracting economic support to their medical \nschool. Students\u2019 denunciations produced G\u00f3mez Esparza\u2019s destitution as secretary of the school \nin 1930, though he remained as head of the homeopathic hospital. A year later Porrag as was \ndestituted as dean of the school .120 With Fidel de Regules leading the ENMH, faculty and \nstudents continued protesting against G\u00f3mez Esparza\u2019s marginalizing attitudes at the HNH ,121 \nuntil in 1932 a new administration brought a new leader to the National  Homeopathic \nHospital .122 Even if G\u00f3mez Esparza left the homeopathic hospital as a consequence of a change \n                                                             \n120 Correspondence from ENMH students to the President of the Public Welfare, July 20, 1931, in AHSS, \nBP, EH, HNH, 4, 17, p. 1 -2. \n121 Correspondence from Dr. Alejandro Cerisela, vice minister of the SEP, to D.

Students\u2019 protests also exposed \nG\u00f3mez Esparza\u2019s corruption at the National Homeopathic Hospital in 1932.  \n122 Apparently, G\u00f3mez Esparza enjoyed the President\u2019s support. From 1930 to 1932, authorities \nacknowledged the problem of having two approaches to medicine and therapy at the n ational \nhomeopathic hospital. Some reports advised a clear division of staff and their specific job duties in \nsurgical rooms and homeopathic dispensaries or consulting rooms. See Report from the head of the \nMedical Department of the Public Welfare to the P resident of the Board of Public Welfare on March 25, \n1930, AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 12, p. 9 -15. Other reports recommended closing the surgical wards of the \nhospital and turning this institution into a homeopathic dispensary; some of these reports recommended  \ndismissing G\u00f3mez Esparza and giving the hospital a truly homeopathic approach.

But non e of these recommendations actually took place. \nMoreover, G\u00f3mez Esparza cynically replied to students and authorities\u2019 requests to open spaces in the \nhomeopathic hospital for the practice and teaching of homeopat hic medicine saying that the hospital \u201chas \nbeen, is, and will always be\u201d open to ENMH students and faculty.

Even with Fidel de \nR\u00e9gules at the helm , the school  was an institution in Calles\u2019 decree, but not in the real world . \nDespite the change in government administration, de R\u00e9gules received no support from the SEP \nin 1932 ; \u201cnot ev en a chair where [he] could sit \u201d, he said.123 His house hosted the school, but first \ngraders stopped attending and second and third graders were thinking to do the same for it \nresulted expensive to att end classes at each of the professors\u2019 own residencies.  Two years later, a \nSEP report cited in a special issue  of Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica , the Journal of the Union of Medical \nDoctors of Mexico City, indicated that the school was still hosted at de R\u00e9gules residence,  that \nthe school\u2019s library had only \u201cthree books of white homeopathic magic, an anatomy by Higinio \nP\u00e9rez, and lacked archives\u201d, and that facilities included only 14 deteriorated benches, 11 \ndeteriorated chairs, 1 desk, and 1 microscope .124 Whether this was a  transcription of the r eport or \nnot, the tone is  suggestive of how SEP inspectors or ENM graduates perceived ENMH facilities \nat the time. But even the description was exaggerated, or despite SEP authorities or homeopathy \ndetractors\u2019 opinion, these numbers indicate that the ENMH lacked the essential elements to \nprovide medical education. Its situation was even worse than ELHM\u2019s when it started in 1912.  \nENMH\u2019s conditions led the SEP to temporally stop issuing medical degrees to ENMH \ngraduates and close the sc hool, but eventually student activism aligned it with new President \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nEsparza, and the President of the Board of Public Health, from July 27 to October 20, 1931, AHSS, BP, \nEH, HNH, 4, 17, p. 12 -7.  \n123 Dr. de R\u00e9gules complained to Franci sco Ortiz Rubio, head of Public Welfare, and apparently the \nPresident\u2019s brother, that the SEP\u2019s minister promised him all the material and moral support . \nCorrespondence from Dr. Fidel de R\u00e9gules to Francisco Ortiz Rubio, head of the Office of Public \nWelfar e, on July 27, 1931, in AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 4, 17, pp. 12 -13. \n124 SEP\u2019s report in October, 1934, quoted in Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica , the journal of the Sindicato de m\u00e9dicos \ncirujanos del D.

Being \ngoverned by ENM graduates, the office did not support the ENMH\u2019s growth. The offices \u2019 head \neven denied medical degrees to ENMH\u2019s students who had already passed their final \nexaminations in 1933. The closure of the school in 1934 motivated the recently created \nAsocicaci\u00f3n de Estudiantes de Homeopat\u00eda del Distrito Federal  [Association of Homeopathic \nStudents of the Federal District] to seek political support with the Student Federation of \nTechnical Schools .126 The connection of these two societies placed the ENMH in a social, \npolitical, and institutional context that resulted in the school\u2019s obtaining long-term state support. \nIn 1935, the Minister of the SEP placed the homeopathic school under the Office of Technical \nEducation. A year later, this office organized SEP\u2019s technica l schools into the National \nPolytechnic Institute, an institution that professionalized vocational education during the \nC\u00e1rdenas presidential term.  \nState support brought resources that drastically improved ENMH\u2019s facilities in the late \n1930s. In 1939, the  National Polytechnic Institute showcased ENMH\u2019s modern and scientific \nfacilities which promised prospective students to be trained in lab sciences  such as biochemistry \n(See Figure 5 ), bacteriology, parasitology, histology, physiology (See Figure 6), and pharmacy , \nand medical sciences such as anatomy, surgery, internal medicine, obstetri cs, and gynecology \n(See Figure 7 ).127 In turn, the school attracted a larger student population. During the 1930s the \nschool graduated 7.9 students per year, more than double the number it graduated in the 1910s or \neven when the SEP funded it (1920 \u20134) (See Graph 1). Moreover, its rate of graduation almost \n                                                             \n125 This brief recount of the situation of the ENMH within the SEP is taken from Escuela Nacional de \nMedicina Homeop\u00e1tica   29-34.; and Francois Flores, Historia de la homeopat\u00eda en M\u00e9xico   61-65. \n126 Carlos Montfort, the student t hat led students \u2019 mobilizations in the conflict with Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez Esparza, \nled this new mobilization in 1933 -4.  \n127 Escuela Nacional de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica . 164 \n paralleled the ELHM\u2019s (9.9 students per year in the 1930s). E NMH \u2019s curricular structure was \nessentially the same as the ELHM  in 1939 (See Table 1), indicating that the SEP\u2019s intervention \nprovided a shared curricular structure in all medical schools regulated by this government \ninstitution. Like ELHM, the ENMH\u2019s curricular thematic content reflected that of the ENM, \nthough it of fered fewer courses in each topic and on medical specialties. The confluence of the \ncurricular structure and the display of modern and scientific facilities in both SEP -administered \nhomeopathic medical schools points to the tools used by L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas\u2019 a dministration to \nfulfill the promises of the revolution and to bring modern medical training to the working class.  \n  \nFigure 5. \u201c Students Taking Their Class in the Laboratory of Biochemistry\u201d at \nthe National School of Homeopathic Medicine circa 1939\nEscuela Nacional deMedicina Homeopatica (Mexico ,D.F.:Secretaria deEducacion Publica, Departamento deEnse\u00f1anza Superior, Tecnica ,Industrial,\nComerical ,Vocacional yPrevocacional ,Instituto Politecnico Nacional, 1939 ),pp.48.\n165 \n Conclusion  \nThe state regulation of homeopathic medical schools took almost half a century  to \nachieve . The difficulties that Mexican governments faced in controlling one of the most powerful \nprofessional groups in the first half of the 20th century resulted from the contradictions between \nopposing medical doctrines, class i nterests, and different government administrations. \nHomeopathic medical training was not drastically different from that provided by the ENM, \nneither during the Porfiriato  nor after 1910. But the struggle for state support made ENM \ngraduates and authoritie s frame homeopathy as a \u201cbifurcation of science\u201d and the ENMH as a \nsecond -class medical school that provided poor medical training. While orthodox homeopathy \noffered an alternative view of the human body with a particular approach to therapeutic \ninterventi on in contrast to the one offered at the ENM, it did not precluded homeopathic medical \nschools from providing adequate medical training. Rather, orthodox homeopathy offered an \nideology around which students and faculty united to fight for their right to ac cess professional \nmedical training, in the case of the ELHM, and state support, in the case of the ENMH. In other \nwords, homeopathic ideology in itself did not preclude an adequate medical training. The \ndivisionary and marginalizing discourse of ENM gradua tes aimed to monopolize state resources \nand turn public opinion to their side. But because of political enmities or convictions, state \nauthorities acknowledged the importance of homeopathic medical schools as independent \ninstitutions that needed regulation  and support. Ironically, despite the state\u2019s recognition of \nhomeopathic school\u2019s institutional independence from the UNM and despite the doctrinarian \ndifferences and ideologies endorsed by homeopathic schools, state support and regulation 166 \n implied acknowle dgment of medical science as a tool and a sign of modern medical training and \nmedical progress by homeopathic medical schools .128  \nThe regulation of homeopathic medical schools occurred in a period of radical social \ntransformations that were reflected in the creation of new forms to bring medical training to the \nworking class. The creation of the ENMH is a s ymbol of the privileged pos ition of elite \nphysicians during the Porfiriato , and the discussions about ENMH representing a bifurcation of \nscience were no more than ENM elite physicians\u2019 complains about losing Porfirio D\u00edaz\u2019s \nunilateral support. While originally the ENMH intended to s olve the problem of irregular \nhomeopathic healers in Mexico City, it actually provided homeopathic medical training to social \nelites and did so throughout the 1910s and 20s. The conflict within the UNM was but an \nextension of the Porfirian  conflict among m edical elites. The social upheaval after D\u00edaz\u2019s de feat \nin 1910 introduced a model of medical education that actually addressed working -class needs. \nThe struggle between ELHM and ENM graduates took place in the arena of the regulation of \nprofessional medica l practice (that I will analyze in chapter 4 and 5). But ELHM \u2019s recognition as \na worth y medical school by state authorities and the increasing rate of professional homeopathic \nmedical doctors that it graduated placed the ELHM as a working -class institution  that competed \nwith the elite ENM. Moreover, while the  shift toward  regulating free schools and reinsta ting the \nENMH was originally a political revenge against the UNM for not complying with Calles\u2019 \ninterests, in the long run it also signaled an institutio nal path that C\u00e1rdenas  used to provide \nprofessional training for the working class while centralizing its regulation . The revolution \n                                                             \n128 Ana Mar\u00eda Carrillo\u2019s arguments about the tensions between professional autonomy and state regulation \nduring the 19th century extended to the first half of the 20th century. She argues that though with its \nrelationship with the state the medical profession  gained political power over the rest of the health \nprofessions, the state was not consequential with the medical profession\u2019s monopolistic desires. This \napplies to homeopathy and its alternative view of homeopathy in homeopathic medical schools. Carrillo,  \n\"M\u00e9dicos del M\u00e9xico decimon\u00f3nico: entre el control estatal y la autonom\u00eda profesional.\"  167 \n turned an elitist effort to train irregular homeopathic practitioners during the Porfiriato  into two \nmedical schools that o ffered medical training to the working class during and after L\u00e1zaro \nC\u00e1rdenas\u2019 presidential term.  \nIn a larger perspective, the state\u2019s regulation of homeopathic medical schools during the \nfirst half of the 20th century aimed to centralize curricular, administrative, and political control. \nEvery wave of r egulation centered its efforts o n standardizing the academic curriculum of \nhomeopathic schools, following the ENM\u2019s model during the Porfiriato and at the UNM, and the \nELHM\u2019s model in the 1930s under SEP\u2019s regulation. This division resulted from the split \nbetween the SEP and the UNM as regulating institutions at the turn of the 1930s.

This tendency was but a generalization of what happened at the local level. The state \ncreated and regu lated homeopathic medical schools as schools independent from government \noffices that regulated the ENM. In this sense, while state intervention regulated medical \ncurricula, it diversified medical schools.  \nThis diversification had consequences within stat e funded homeopathic institutions, as \nexemplified by the fate of the ENMH during the 1920s. Dependence on the state\u2019s budget \nthreatened this school\u2019s own existence, and like the ENM, the ENMH\u2019s fate depended on the \npolitics of the state. In contrast, the E LHM did not depend on the state as a training institution, \nand state policies did not impact its institutional life as such during the 1910s, 20s and early \n30s.130   \nPolitically, homeopathic medical schools adapted to the changing interests of the state \nfrom  the Porfiriato to revolutionary governments. While the ENMH a dapted to policies that \nfavored social elites, medical science, and top -down approaches to the regulation of medical \npractices during the Porfiriato , the ELHM and eventually the ENMH in the earl y 1930s a dapted \nto the revolutionary state rhetoric of providing education to the working class. By becoming a \nbottom -up model for medical training, homeopathic medical schools also turned into a coin for \npolitical exchange. The ELHM functioned as a counte rweight to the immense political power \nthat the ENM had at the UNM during the Maximato , and the ENMH served C\u00e1rdenas\u2019 program \n                                                             \n129 See also chapter 1 in Julio Moreno, Yankee Don't Go Home! : Mexican Nationalism, American \nBusiness Culture, and the Shaping of Modern Mexico, 1920 -1950 , The Luther H artwell Hodges Series on \nBusiness, Society, and the State (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003).  \n130 When L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas aimed to centralize homeopathic medical training at the SEP, he aimed to turn \nback the regulation of the ELHM and clos e it down.

Contending the \u201cFifth Plague\u201d: Medical Degrees, Medical Practice, and the \nPolitics to Sanitize  the Medical Profession, 1910 \u201334 \nOn December 4, 1936, Antonio P\u00e9rez Alcocer, head of the Departamento de Salubridad \n[Department of Public Health , hereon DSP] Office of Legal Affairs, reported how difficult it was \nfor the sanitary department to enforce the sections of the Sanitary Code that aimed to regulate \nmedical practice . The lawyer was con cerned because the contradiction between the Constitution \nof 1917 and the Sanitary Code obliged his office to register medical degrees without certifying if \nthe schools that issued them provided proper medical training. In his report, he asked:  \nHow could t he Department of Public Health itself be held responsible [of the \nrights of the Mexican Society] under such circumstances, if it had to register a \ncrowd of titles issued in an illegal or fraudulent way by the States of the Republic \n[sic], where there are n ot even establish ments of secondary instruction?1 \n  \nP\u00e9rez Alcocer\u2019s report evidences the frustrations of sanitary authorities in their attempts to \nregulate medical practice during the first decades of the sanitary dictatorship. His was not an \nisolated opinion. Even after two reforms to the Sanitary Code, in 1926 and 1934, Alfonso \nPruneda, former head of the DSP Office of Legal Affairs, believed that the \u201ccampaign against \ncharlatanism\u201d needed to be carried out with more intensity through all possible mea ns, \nsuggesting that improvements in the later call fell short on what was required .2 The way he \ndescribed these limitations suggests that he believed sanitary authorities coped well with the \nproblem of practitioners who lacked a title, but that those who i ndeed had it were more \ndangerous and needed closer attention.  \n                                                             \n1 See \u201cEstudio formulado por el jefe del Departamento de Salubridad P\u00fablica sobre el registro de t\u00edtulos \nm\u00e9dicos y actividades conexas\u201d Segundo texto, December 4, 1936; correspondence from Antonio Perez \nAlcocer to the head of the DSP, in AHSS, SP, P, S, 14,  5. \n2 Alfonso Pruneda read his opinion in the National Academy of Medicine on February 20, 1935.

Academic physicians had been aiming to control the practice \nof medicine during the 19th century by making the possession of a state -issued medical degree \nthe legal requ irement to participate in the institutional life of the emerging bureaucratic Porfirian  \nstate.3 Yet the liberality of the Constitution  of 1857, the strong federalism, and the poor presence \nof academically trained physicians in the capital, in other urban c enters, and in the countryside \ndid not mean that sanitary authorities enforced the sanitary law in Mexico City or that the states \nadopted, let alone implemented, such regulations .4 These led, as Claudia Agostoni has pointed \n                                                             \n3 A hygienic city, with high life expectancy and a reduced mortali ty rate became part of the political \ndiscourse about progress and modernity during the Porfiriato . As a consequence, D\u00edaz\u2019s regime used the \nSanitary Board of Health to promote a series of projects to turn Mexico into an international example of \nsanitary in tervention. The Board issued the first sanitary code of independent Mexico in 1891. Besides \nsanitary regulations, the code established clear rules on the registration of medical titles and the provision \nof death certificates. Accordingly, all practitioners  were required to notify the Board or the local authority \nabout their activities and their consulting offices\u2019 addresses. Physicians with a medical degree who lived \nin Mexico City were required to register their degrees, while those who lived in other stat es could do it at \ntheir own will. The code allowed issuing death certificates only to registered physicians who were entitled \nto refuse this obligation when they found signs of an unnatural cause of death. Practitioners who lacked a \nmedical degree needed t o request a death certificate from a local coroner. Infringements to these \nregulations were considered a minor fault and received a fine between 5 and 100 Mexican pesos. Due to \nthe limited jurisdiction of the Superior Board or Health, these specific regula tions were restricted to the \nFederal District \u2013which included Mexico City and neighboring territories - and the federal territories of \nColima and Baja California. During the rest of the Porfiriato and the armed phase of the revolution (1891 -\n1917), the Super ior Board of Health neither actualized any regulations related to the registry of titles or \nthe issuing of death certificates in the sanitary code, nor created any office that controlled medical \npractice based on the contemporary legislation. The Sanitary Code suffered reforms in 1894 and 1903, but \nnone of them modified the original regulation of medical practice of the one of 1891.See Agostoni, \nMonuments of Progress: Modernization and Public Health in Mexico City, 1876 -1910 .; also see \n\u201cEjercicio de la medicina en sus diferentes ramos.\u201d Sanitary Code of the Mexican United States.

W hile they arguably had academic training in medicine, they did not \ncomply with the requirements that sanitary authorities imposed, for instance passing an examination by \nthe School of Medicine\u2019s faculty. For the 1859 medical registry where Comellas and Car b\u00f3 are included \nsee Reyes, \"M\u00e9dicos, cirujanos, farmac\u00e9uticos, dentistas, flebotomianos, y parteras,\" 2.  \nPresident Santa Ana issued a title to Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3 on December 6, 1854, so he could practice specifically \nhomeopathic medicine. AHSS, SP, EM, 3, 63. Ram\u00f3n Comella\u2019s request to the Superior Board of Health \nto register his title is in AHENM, CSS, 30, 6, pp. 2 -3. Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3\u2019s petition to practice medicine in the \nMexican Republic is in AHENM, CSS, 31, 1, pp. 1 -4. The Superior Board of Health described the legal \nsituation of homeopaths in correspondence with the governor of Mexico City, July 3, 1855 and July 13, 172 \n out, to the proliferation of ill egal medical practitioners during the Porfiriato .5 These practitioners \nwere in the majority of cases unlicensed practitioners, i.e. those who did not have a medical or \nother type of professional degree. Though there were a small group of licensed practitio ners who \ncontested sanitary authority, like midwives, pharmacists and dentists, the y were eventually \nincluded in the institutions that regulated the medical profession .6  \nThe social, political, and institutional transformations initiated by the political a nd armed \nmobilization of 1910 reframed the problem of regulating medical practice in the 1920s and 30s. \nThis chapter analyzes th ese transformations and their impact on the policies to regulate the \nmedical profession. After armed mobilizations ceased in 191 7, the reconstruction of Mexico \nbegan. A  new Constitution was issued ; institutions that administered professional training were \npushed into profound reorganization, shifting the role of the state in regulating professional \nmedical training; public health r ose as a form of governance and its institutions enforced sanitary \nregulations that regarded unlicensed physicians as a public health threat. These trends sometimes \ncoincided and sometimes competed to establish both a coherent legislation that ruled the \nprofessional life of physicians and a monolithic institutional infrastructure that enforced such \nlegislation. These tensions an d contradictions originated, according to author ities and university \nphysicians , in the lack of a norm that established which profe ssions required a professional \nmedical degree; in other words in the lack of regulation of article 4 of the Constitution . The \nMexican state did not achieve the central control of medical training and practice until early in \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n1855 in AHSS, SP, EM, 2, 36. Sanitary authorities used the medical degree as a credential that helped \nthem prevent unlicensed medical practitioners from participating in official government life in the 1870s, \nsuch as the issuing of death certificates. See \"CR\u00d3NICA M\u00c9DICA. Acuerdo sobre una solicitud de la \nSociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1tica Mexicana.\"   \n5 Agostoni, \"M\u00e9dicos cient\u00edficos y m\u00e9dicos il\u00edcitos en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico durante el Porfiriato.\"   \n6 Ana Mar\u00eda Carrillo points out that these professions, including surgeons and phlebotomists, were \nassimilated by the medical profession, while others, such as homeopaths, contested the profession\u2019s \nauthority. See Carrillo, \"Profesiones sanitarias y lucha de poderes en el M\u00e9xico del siglo XIX.\"   173 \n the 1940s, when article 4 was re gulated. Sanitary authorities and the medical profession, \nincluding homeopaths, had a deep influence in the outcomes of such regulation, but these \ndiscussions took place beyond the DSP and the National University of Mexico [UNM].  \nIn this chapter, I examine the negotiations between DSP, UNM, and SEP author ities who \nworked to pass regulation s to control medical practice. In particular, I emphasize the central role \nthat sanitary authorities played in this process. The UNM did not want to assume the role  of a \nstate institution that pre scribed professional training, particularly at free schools, and in the late \n1920s lost its place as a state institution that could potentially regulate professional training, at \nleast locally in Mexico City. Facing a lack of willingness and ultimately authority, the DSP \npromoted reforms to , and the enforcement of , the Sanitary Code, aiming to cope with \npractitioners who lacked irregular medical degrees. I argue that the drive to control medical \npractice came from the DSP\u2019s new position in the government structure initiated in 1917, from \nwhere it had the authority to rule on health matters all over the nation. I also argue that sanitary \nauthorities aimed to sanitize the profession at the national level assuming that the  demography of \nprofessional physicians in the countryside reflected that of Mexico City. This led to a wave of \ncomplaints from the countryside which is the subject of the next chapter. Throughout this chapter \nI assume that sanitary authorities are acting a s a consequence of the demands of graduates from \nfree schools, particularly homeopathic, first from Mexico City and later from other states. An \nanalysis of these negotiations and their effect on the sanitary legislation will be provided in the \nnext chapter .  174 \n \u201cLegal or legally validated medical degrees\u201d: The Shifting Role of the Revolutionary State to \nRegulate Medical Degrees  \nThe institutional instability that the Maderista revolution caused during the early years of \nthe 1910s had a deep impact on the regula tion of the medical profession, as Ricardo E. Manuell \nand Eduardo Lavalle y Carbajal attest .7 Manuell\u2019s reference to the liberal practice of medicine as \n\u201cthe fifth plague\u201d , which needed eradication, and Lavalle y Carbajal\u2019s argument in favor of \nrequiring \u201c legal or legally validated medical degrees\u201d to anyone who practiced medicine \nevidenced the uncertainties that members of the Academy of Medicine of Mexico perceived \nregarding the professional liberty granted in the Constitution . Manuell argued that the  \nlast of the biggest great national plagues [\u2026w]as a bad weed called The Free \nPractice of Medicine, which had as origin  the ultra -liberal ideas of the authors of \nthe Constitution  [of 1857]; for growing field, the disinterest of the Mexican \npersonality, which commiserates on but do not responds against harms that do not \nhave a personal impact; as food, the generalized presumption that everyone has \nqualities of a physician; as fertilizers, ignorance, suggestibility, and the need to \nbelieve that anyone can formul ate an opinion on matters of a profession that they \ndo not practice; and as victim, the whole Republic.8    \n \nHe argued that the practice of medicine required specialized knowledge and that no one \nshould be put at risk by being put into the care of someone who, while well versed in other \nbranches of human knowledge, had tangential or no knowledge of medicine. Moreover, he \nparticularly focused his critiques on those who  \npretended to see something in the secret arcane that constituted medicine [that \nattracted  everyone, and that event the true priests who practiced medicine could \n                                                             \n7 See Manuell, \"DISCURSO pronunciado por su autor, en la sesi\u00f3n celebrada en el anfiteatro de la \nEscuela Preparatoria, el 6 de marzo de 1912.\" ; and Lavalle y Carbajal, \"Historia de la medicina en \nM\u00e9xico. A los m\u00e9dicos debe exig\u00edrseles t\u00edtulo oficial u oficialmente revalidado.\"  \n8 Manuell, \"DISCURSO pronunciado por su autor, en la sesi\u00f3n celebrada en el anfiteatro de la Escuela \nPreparatoria, el 6 de marzo de 1912,\" 121.  175 \n not penetrate] and believed, and made others believed, that they had grasped one \nof the secret light beams that escaped the insight of the officiants.9  \n \nHe provided a description of t hese practices, among which were native people\u2019s healing \napproaches mingled with traditional religious beliefs; \u201cmore civilized\u201d domestic remedies whose \ncurative powers were testified by large lists of professionals, even physicians; charlatans who \nspectac ularly advertised their services in the streets, offering secret remedies to heal incurable \ndiseases; new drugs or serums whose therapeutic efficacy was certified by non -medical \nauthorities such as judges, governors, bishops and the like; and medical consu ltation by mail. \nHomeopaths, as analyzed in chapter 3, had a particular place in his critique.  \nLavalle  y Carbajal \u2019s critique regarded the liberal practice of medicine in the same terms \nas Manuell\u2019s. He believed that  \nMexico City [was] cruelly suffering under the scourge of that epidemic endemic \n[\u201cendemia epidemizada \u201d] Fortunately, it was easily to indirectly apply the \n[article] 33 with the regulation of [article] 3 [of the Constitution ] to the free germs \nof this invadi ng pest. After that, the purification of the means \u2026, legal, will \nsuffocate the epidemic.\u201d For him, \u201cthe Mexican medical science was agonizing \nbecause of [the growing population of charlatans], and the Congress could apply \nan effective restorative injectio n, expulsing the merchants from the temple, \npreventing young galenos from being tempted by the reckless mercantilism of \nthose who do not have a name to defend and a school to honor.10  \n \nAfter analyzing the laws and codes that regulated the medical professio n in Mexico and how the \nliberal practice of medicine made sanitary preventions and actions ineffective, he believed that \nthe focus of regulation should be that an \u201cofficial or officially validated degree must be required \nto every physician\u201d, as the title o f his critique read. For him, regulation did not end with the \ngranting of a diploma. The government needed to undertake specific steps to warrant proper \n                                                             \n9 Manuell, \"DISCURSO pronunciado por su autor, en la sesi\u00f3n celebrada en el anfiteatro de la Escuela \nPreparatoria, el 6 de marzo de 1912,\" 123.  \n10 Lavalle\u2019s paper was a thorough analysis of the current legal situation of the medical practice in Mexico \nand in France. His analysis resulted in guidelines that indicated ways in which Mexico could adopt such \nregulatory tende ncies.  See Lavalle y Carbajal, \"Historia de la medicina en M\u00e9xico. A los m\u00e9dicos debe \nexig\u00edrseles t\u00edtulo oficial u oficialmente revalidado,\" 138.  176 \n medical training. Accordingly, the Ministry of Public Instruction needed to certify private \nschools\u2019 me dical degrees by supervising the annual examinations in those schools, he said. Only \nin that way, he concluded,  \nthe state will warrant that certificates, degrees , or titles, issued by the Free School, \nproofed an undeniable aptitude, [\u2026] that the curricula  is extensive and intensive \nenough to produce aptitude, and that private degrees corresponded to the same \nknowledge validated by the degre es issued by the state.11 \n \nThe regulatory framework he proposed was particularly addressed to private schools which wer e \nstarting to populate Mexico City\u2019s landscape in the early 1910s (see chapter 3).  \nHowever accurate and pertinent Manuell\u2019s and Lavalle y Carbajal\u2019s descriptions and \nproposals were, it revealed the anxieties and hopes that the medical profession faced in a  new \norder which at least they perceived as an opportunity for both irregular healers to perpetuate their \nillegal practice and elite professional physicians to accomplish the regulation of article 3 of the \nruling Constitution  and monopolize medical practic e. On one hand, t he proliferation of private \nmedical schools  such as the Escuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda de M\u00e9xico  (see chapter 3)  fed \nacademic physicians\u2019 and public health authorities\u2019 anxieties about the increased presence of \nirregular practitioners and sch ools that provided them with illegal medical degrees in Mexico \nCity. On the other, policies such as  Madero\u2019s support to the National Academy of Medicine in \n1912 fed hopes about the regulation  of the medical profession.12 The construction of the \nrevolutionar y state worked contradictorily in this process of regulation. On one side, the \nConstitution  of 1917 did not regulate professional practice and left the congress the authority to \ndo so in the future. During the 1920s and 30s, this allowed a margin for polit ical negotiations \n                                                             \n11 Lavalle y Carbajal, \"Historia de la medicina en M\u00e9xico. A los m\u00e9dicos debe exig\u00edrseles t\u00edtulo oficial u \noficialmente revalidado,\" 169.  \n12 The Academy requested such acknowledgment to Presdient Madero. On January 9, 1912, D\u00edaz \nLombardo replied that Madero acknowledged it as an \u201coficial institituion\u201d. See \"La Academia N. de \nMedicina de M\u00e9xico, ha recibido la si guiente comunicaci\u00f3n.\"   177 \n between different factions that did not always result in the fulfillment of what elite professionals \nsuch as doctors and lawyers desired . On the other  side, sanitary authorities gained unprecedented \npolitical power during these years , giving doctors a privileged position in the new structure of the \nrevolutionary state. They used this hegemonic control over federal public health to get rid of the \n\u201cfifth plague\u201d  or, in other words, to sanitize the profession.  \nThe Constitution of 1917 pr ovided the regulatory framework around which the state \nstructured its institutions. Article 3 of the previous Constitution  was almost left untouched in the \nnew one; with the exception of the last paragraph, the one that regulated professional practice. \nThe new Constitution  legally separated the connection that existed between free education and \nfree professional practice, turning at least ideologically and legally professions into a social \nrather than an academic issue .13 Hisotrian Arce Gurza analyzes how co ngressmen who \nelaborated the new Constitution  left behind the mid -19th-century liberal ideology that was the \ncore of the Constitution  of 1857 .14 These modifications to article 3 and 4 were conceived to bring \nprofessional services, particularly those of lawy ers and physicians, to the population, which \nfrequently did not have the economic resources to pay for these professional services. At the \nsame time, congressmen considered that the Constitution  should also protect the population from \nservices provided by unqualified professionals. Hence, such reforms aimed to socialize \nprofessions and create laws that regulated them. But article 4 of the Constitution  of 1917 fell \nshort from these ideals. Besides separating the right to work from the right to education, art icle 4 \nonly introduced the notion that professions needed to be legal, but each federal state remained \nresponsible of \u201cestablishing the professions that needed a degree to practice, the requirements to \n                                                             \n13 Arce Gurza, \"El inicio de una Nueva Era, 1910 -1945,\"   291 -2. \n14 Arce Gurza analyses the speech of Deputy Machorro Narv\u00e1ez during the Congress meetings celebrated \nin 1916 to create the new constitution.

Consequently, \nthe problem of regulating a medical degree and by extension medical pr actice was a complex \none. The degree was the point of confluence of several social, political and economic needs that \nwere highly contested and negotiated during the post revolutionary period in Mexico. Among \nthese were the professionalization of the worki ng class, which implied the need to provide \nworkers and artisans with adequate training; the incorporation of public health policies that \nimproved life expectancy of the working force, which included the provision of adequate \nmedical services by well train ed doctors; the modernization of medical training, which required \nexpensive facilities and surgical instrument s; and the ideological and economical conflict \nbetween the Mexican state and the UNM concerning the sociopolitical role of the university and \nthe state\u2019s compromise to fund it. Which institution had the legal right to offer a medical degree \nwas a question that raised all sorts of contradictory responses from different actors.  \nOnce Venustiano Carranza established a somewhat stable government in 1916 , he used \nthe Porfirian  infrastructure to carry out the social reforms embodied in the new Constitution . The \nUNM became the center that administered some of the professional schools in Mexico City, \nincluding the National School of Medicine [ENM]. Initially , it aimed to police professional \npractice. For instance, in 1916, Felix F. Palavicini, Minister of Instruction and Head of the \nNational University demanded to the Ministry of the Interior that the Police Department of \n                                                             \n15 Article 4 of the Constitution of 1917. See Arce Gurza, \"El inicio de una Nueva Era, 1910 -1945,\"   295.  179 \n Mexico City prosecute those who pract iced without a legal professional degree, and oblige them \nto validate their studies and take a professional exam .16 But in the early 1920s, the university \nstopped policing professional practice. The situation of the UNM in the new government \nstructure was c ontradictory. On one side, Porfirian  elites had created it in 1910 with the aim to \nturn it into a federal office that regulated professional training all over the nation. The National \nSchool of Homeopathic Medicine and other professional schools in the res t of the republic used \nthe university\u2019s medical curriculum and regulations as models to frame their  own throughout the \n1910s and 20s, turning the university into an academic authority. On the other side, neither the \nruling Constitution  in 1910 nor the Constitution  of 1917 gave the UNM the legal framework that \ncould have turned it into a regulatory institution at the national level. Rather the contrary, \nprofessional and educational liberalism altogether with the strong federalism in both \nConstitution s helped to keep the university an institution that could only legally regulate \nprofessional training and the issuing of degrees in Mexico City. In other words, while the \nuniversity enjoyed academic prestige all over the nation, becoming the actual academic au thority \nin professional training after 1910, the Constitution  of 1917 did not ratify it in legal or \nbureaucratic terms as a regulatory institution.  \nThe authority of the university as a center of professional control was further undermined \nwhen Jos\u00e9 Vascon celos became its Dean in the early 1920s. Vasconcelos transformed the UNM \nfrom a Porfirian  institution that instructed social and economic elites into a popular institution \nthat offer ed professional training and transmitted a new cultural identity to the m asses. His \n                                                             \n16 In his demand, Palavicini used the same arguments as Lavalle previously did in 1913. The possession \nof a degree was  for the sake of the public interest and fair competition. Ignorance brought exploitation of \nthe Mexican people by foreign professionals or those who obtained a degree without the proper scientific \ntraining. If there were two types of degrees, one which re quired years of study and one which could be \neasily obtained, the latter, so the argument went on, would be better positioned in the market of \nprofessional services. Felix Palavicini\u2019s intervention wanted to make the interest of the UNM\u2019s graduates \nprevail  over those of charlatans. See AHSS, BP, EH, HNH, 1, 29, 8.  180 \n project did not always fit the demands of professional elites, as in the case of the faculty of the \nNational School of Medicine (see chapter 3 where I analyzed Vasconcelos\u2019 support to \nhomeopathy). Moreover, in administrative terms, the UNM lost its privileged position when \nVasconcelos created the SEP to undertake the task of sending qualified t eachers throughout the \ncountry and educate a largely illiterate population. In this reorganization, the university became \nan office that only administered professional schools. This impacted its position as a n institution \nthat regulated professional degrees.  \nIn its new administrative position, the UNM decided in 1922 not to revalidate \nprofessional degrees from neither national nor foreign universities, a pol icy that it pursued \nthroughout 1929 .17 In exchange, it offered to endorse such degrees if it attested that their degrees \nwere somehow legal .18 The difference was subtle but meaningful. Revalidation implied that the \nuniversity warranted the training the degre e holder had received, while endorsing meant that it \nwarranted that the degree holder had received the degree from the institution the degree actually \nstated. This important difference translated into criteria that the UNM used to either endorse or \nprovide  a professional degree. To pass the test of legality and endorse a degree, the university \nhad to acknowledge that the foreign professional schools that issued the degrees either had an \ninternational agreement with the Mexican government to allow the practi ce of their graduates in \n                                                             \n17 Just in 1920 President Adolfo de la Huerta had passed legislation that established criteria to revalidate \ndegrees in the UNM. See AHUNM, ENAE, Secretar\u00eda, Programas, planes y reglamentos, 20, 4 36. For the \nregulation in 1922, see the pamphlet of the National University of Mexico signed by Manuel Puga y Cal, \nsecretary of the university, May 30, 1922. AHUNAM, UN, Rectoria, D. E. U., 14, 236. The session of the \nUniversity Council that approved this regulation was held on May 21, 1922; see AHSS, SP, EM, 4, 7. On \nMarch 26, 1925, Plutarco El\u00edas Calles ratified the criterion of 1922. See summary of the DSP\u2019s annual \ninform, section 28, in \u00c1lvarez Am\u00e9zquita, Bustamante and Fern\u00e1ndez del Castillo, Historia de la \nsalubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico   254. See also section VIII in the report from the office of medical \ndemography in the \u201cINFOMRE DEL DEPARTAMENTO DE SALUBRIDAD PARA EL MENSAJE \nPRESIDENCIAL DEL 1\u00ba DE SEPTIEMBRE DE 1925\u201d, in AHSS, SP, P, S, 9, 1 5. \n18 Besides the test of legality, the person needed to certify his/her identity and that the professional \ndegrees were genuine.  181 \n Mexico or was considered by the university as worthy. For national schools, the university \nneeded to verify that they were authorized by their respective local government and laws. The \nUNM issued professional degrees only when its schools and faculty examined students who \nrequested a degree from it. This meant that the university granted professional degrees to \nstudents who had undertaken either partially or totally their studies in other universities and later \npassed a general exam ination in the professional schools of the university. With this regulation \nuniversity authorities placed not the degree, but knowledge as sanctioned by UNM faculty, as the \ncenter of professional regulation. What matter ed was not the document itself, which  many faked, \naccording to Ricardo E. Manuell, to enter into the business of medicine, but the training the \ndegree represented. Throughout the 20th century, the UNM\u2019s medical curriculum remained the \nstandard of proficient medical training and its regulation s placed the university as the office that \ncontrolled the revalidation of professional medical degrees, at least in Mexico City.  \nThis centralization of professional education in the university led to contradictory \noutcomes in the regulation of homeopathic  medical degrees. On one side, Vasconcelos \u2019 support \nof the National School of Homeopathic Medicine [ENMH] did not imply any improvement in \nthe regulation of its professional degrees. D\u00edaz\u2019s decree made them legal regardless of the \nadministrative changes ta king place in the transitional years after the issuing of the Constitution  \nof 1917. Yet, while Vasconcelos\u2019 administrative reorganization brought economic support to the \nENMH as a school within the UNM, it eventually led to the school\u2019s closure in 1924. Th is meant \nthat the single homeopathic medical school able to issue legal medical degrees stopped existing \nin the mid -1920s. The outcome was a regulatory measure from university authorities who were \nmostly ENM graduates, rather than Vasconcelos, to ban homeo pathic training at the ENM and \nhomeopathic medical degrees (as analyzed in chapter 3). This situation changed again in 1928, 182 \n when the ENMH was reinstalled as a medical school regulated by the SEP rather than the \nUNM .19 President El\u00edas Calles\u2019 decree was a c opy of the one issued by Porfirio D\u00edaz in 1895, \nboth academically and administratively, placing the homeopathic school in the same situation as \nit was during the 1910s. Yet being hosted by the SEP rather than the university, the process of \nautonomy of the national university and the regulations of free schools during 1929 \u201330 (see \nbelow) did not impact the ENMH \u2019s legal status or the legality of its degree. Du ring ENMH\u2019s \nfirst years (1910 \u201324) and after 1928, its problems lied in aspiring to become a medical s chool \nand improving its facilities and medical curricula (as analyzed in chapter 3), rather than enjoying \nlegal status.  \nOn the other side, it meant that the Free School of Homeopathy [ELHM], the one that \nwas actually producing the largest amount of homeopa thic physicians in Mexico City in the early \n1920s, was not acknowledged as a medical school. Their graduates could not endorse their \ndegrees with the university because it did not acknowledge studies undertaken in free schools .20 \nThey could request to be ex amined in order to obtain a degree from the university, but the \nprocess implied that ELHM graduates acknowledged that their alma mater  was not actually a \nlegal school \u2014 something they fought for until the school received official recognition (see \nbelow) . This created confusion amongst university authorities who needed to accommodate \ninternal regulations according to particular cases  and caused students  to be concern ed about the \nirregularities in such processes. Request s to validate homeopathic medical de grees happened \nvery rarely. The case of brothers Aliber and Eliud Garc\u00eda Trevi\u00f1o in 1923 is demonstrative of the \n                                                             \n19 Article 2 prevented that the SEP would issue the ENMH degrees. See \"Decreto por el cual se establece \nla carrera de M\u00e9dico Cirujano Home\u00f3pata.\"7  \n20 In a conflict between ELHM graduates and the DSP about the registry of the former\u2019s degrees in the \nmedical registry in 1922, Antonio Caso, head of the UNM, replied to a request by Gabriel Malda, head of \nthe DSP, about the legality o f degrees issued by free schools that the university did not validate titles \nissued by free schools. Chapter 5 provides more detail about this conflict. See correspondence of \nNovember 14, 1922 in AHSS, SP, EM, 4, 15, p. 28.  183 \n political tensions that the regulation of medical degrees created between the university, the \nENMH, and the ELHM .21 This case evidences both the  UNM\u2019s authority strength and weakness \nas an institution that regulated professional degrees; the strength, because both brothers sought to \nobtain the university\u2019s endorsement of their high -school and post -graduate certificates and the \nrevalidation of thei r medical degrees, acknowledging the university as the regulatory institution \nof professional training in Mexico; the weakness, because the procedures to revalidate their \nmedical degrees implied that the university did not acknowledge training at other ins titutions, \nparticularly free medical schools. Moreover, apparently validating regulations were not applied \nconsistently. For instance, Leopoldo Hern\u00e1ndez Ch\u00e1vez could not take the UNM\u2019s validating \nexam because, so did UNM authorities argued, the ELHM lacke d the regulation, while Apolonio \nD. Guti\u00e9rrez was able to course the specialties of pediatrics and dermatology at the UNM .22 Both \nwere ELHM graduates.  \nWith the conflicts between the UNM and the state at the end of the decade that ended in \nthe detachment of the former as a regulatory institution of the state, the university\u2019s privileged \npolitical and administrative position came to an end. The rupture was a consequence of the larger \nstruggle for the political control of the country23 which in turn motivated UNM\u2019s faculty and \n                                                             \n21 I analyze with detail this ca se in chapter 5. Aliber obtained the degree, but after the conflicts motivated \nby students\u2019 complaints, he decided to desist from his request  \n22 It is unclear in the source which university office denied the exam. It is probable, because it had already \nhappened before with brothers Eliud and Aliber Garc\u00eda Trevi\u00f1o, that while the rector authorized \nhomeopaths to take the exam, internal regulations of the School of Medicine prevented them from doing \nit.

During the following six years, a historical period know as the Maximato , \nthe country was administratively led by three interim presidents, Emilio Portes Gil, Pascual Ortiz Rubio \nand Manuel L. Rodr\u00edguez, who stayed in office  approximately two years. They obeyed El\u00edas Calles as the \npolitical leader of the nation, hence his surname, the Jefe M\u00e1ximo . But political leadership did not always \nmean a unified government, for each new president along with its secretaries of state unde rtook \nadministrative actions that differed the ones implemented by the next one. The form in which Pascual 184 \n students to push for the university\u2019s autonomy and support a particular political faction .24 As a \nresult, the National University of Mexico turned into the Autonomous National University of \nMexico [hereon UNAM]. With its autonomy earned, the  UNAM became a professional \ninstitution similar to the rest of professional schools that existed in Mexico City, at least in \nadministrative terms, for it stopped working as the regulatory center of professional education in \nMexico City. The SEP took on the  task to regulate free schools. The DSP in particular \ncoordinated with this ministry to agree on the criteria that made private schools\u2019 facilities \nadequate, their medical curricula comprehensive, and consequently their degrees creditable . The \ninvolvement of two ministries with contrasting and sometimes opposing criteria to cope with the \nregulation of such schools, together with the changes that the Organic Law of the UNAM went \nthrough in 1929 and 1933 created ideological, legal, and executive inconsistenci es that made the \ntransition far from smooth.  \nWhile somewhat negotiated between the SEP, the DSP, and graduates from private \nmedical schools, the formulation of the laws that regulated these schools was mandated directly \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nOrtiz Rubio stepped off office \u2013he read about his own resignation to the presidency in a morning \nnewspaper - epitomized the political and administrati ve conflicts during the Maximato .  \n24 The history of the struggle of faculty and students from the UNM to achieve autonomy from the \nMexican state\u2019s control dates back to its creation in 1910. This history developed throughout the 1920s \nand 30s, sometimes through faculty demands, and sometimes  through students\u2019 congresses or protests. \nAfter 1920, with Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos as its Dean, the University became a tool to develop the nationalistic \nand revolutionary project of providing basic education to the entire nation. This meant the mobilization of \na huge amount of material and human resources to the countryside in order to reach the most \neconomically underserved sectors of the population. But professional education remained elitist and \nliberal; elitist, for only the affluent sectors of the society, many of them living in urban centers, especially \nin Mexico City, could afford this type of education, and liberal because it believed in its own academic \nand administrative self -governance.  In 1928 new projects to attain the autonomy were proposed, one by  a \nstudents\u2019 association and the other by Dean Alfonso Pruneda, but none of them succeeded. In 1929, once \nEmilio Porte Gil took office, a minor conflict between university students and authorities escalated to the \npoint where the public force surreptitious ly infiltrated the university campus, confronting a group of \nstudents that manifested against them. President Portes Gil\u2019s overreaction was caused by the political \nstruggles between the ruling party and the party led by Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos, the one students\u2019 leaders \nsupported. The conflict turned into a general strike which Portes Gil solved by giving the National \nUniversity its autonomy. See Mendoza Rojas, Los conflictos de la UNAM en el siglo XX   49-70. 185 \n by the President, in response to gr aduates\u2019, particularly homeopaths, demands. The Organic Law \nof 1929 proposed to gradually turn UNAM into a private university without \u201cany right to impose \nits criteria in the evaluation of free and private institutions that offered education similar to the \none the university provided\u201d .25 Article 37 explicitly turned the responsibility to regulate free \nschools, validate their curricula, and legalize their degrees to the President of Mexico and the \nSEP. Two weeks after this law was issued, Arturo Palmero, Dean  of the Free School of \nObstetrics and Nursing of Mexico, and a group of \u201cFree Homeopathic Doctors\u201d submitted their \nproposals suggesting how such regulations should be dictated .26 Sanitary authorities received \nauthorization from the President and the SEP\u2019s m inister to participate in the discussions that \nwould produce the needed legislation .27 In their view, the DSP was \u201cdeeply interested in the \nimportance that the regulation of such Free Schools had in Public Health, particularly respective \nto the medical prof ession, and in warrant of the interest of society.\u201d28 Yet, regardless of such \nlegitimate interest, the SEP authorities never called back DSP representatives, and President \nPortes Gil issued the decree that regulated free schools on October 22, 1929.  \nThe de cree contained in essence what free schools originally proposed, though \naccommodated to fit the legal requirements that a decree of this scope demanded. It defined free \nschools as private enterprises at all levels of education with no limitations regarding  their \n                                                             \n25 \u201cLey org\u00e1nica de la Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma\u201d, c onsiderando 12. \nhttp://abogadogeneral.unam.mx/PDFS/COMPENDIO/34.pdf  Consulted on January 30, 2014.   \n26 Arturo Palmero submitted his \u201cProyecto de reglamento de las escuelas libres\u201d on August 9, 1929.

To be considered authorized or legal, these schools needed to give the \nSEP information about their curricula and admission requirem ents. In turn the SEP verified the \nschool\u2019s capability to sustain the training it aimed to provide and determined the minimum \nrequirements to grant degrees. SEP, thence, turned into the office responsible to revalidate, and \nmake legal, the degrees issued b y authorized free professional schools.  \nThe decree, in other words, provided venues through which free schools turned into legal \ninstitutions. Supported by the Federation of Worker Unions of the Federal District, ELHM \ngraduates met with President Portes G il to discuss the authorization of their school. Following \nthe decree\u2019s guidelines, the Ministry of Public Education carried out a thorough investigation of \nthe school. The report stated that the ELHM academic curriculum was satisfactory, though \nauthoritie s were not able to verify if the school actually carried it out as documents stated \u2014 the \ninspection took place during a holiday break . The school \u2019s facilities suffered deficiencies and \nneeded to meet specific hygienic requirements, particularly the rooms of surgery and obstetrics, \nbut the school\u2019s authorities followed the Ministry\u2019s recommendations. The SEP concluded that if \nthe school required that new students previously studied three years of high school before they \nwere enrolled and if the school actua lly covered the academic curriculum, then the ministry \n\u201cwarranted the rights of the society in terms of the training offered in that institution since that \ndate [when the report was issued] and authorized the revalidation of titles granted as a \nconsequence  of such training.\u201d30 On January 28, 1930, the President issued a decree that made \n                                                             \n29 The decree is in \u201cDocumento N\u00fam.

I did not have access to the specific report, but the Ministry of Public Education \ncommented about it to President Pascual Ortiz Rubio on the correspondence of March 3, 1930, in AHSS, 187 \n the ELHM legal .31 The new law just made clear the content of high school studies required for \nenrollment as well as the time and content of medical training required for gradu ation. The \nELHM from now on offered the degree of M\u00e9dico home\u00f3pata cirujano y partero  [Homeopathic \nPhysicians, Surgeon and Obstetrician] with the same legal status as those of any other \ngovernment -authorized medical school.  \nInconsistent policies that resul ted from short -term presidential periods altogether with the \nlarger medical profession\u2019s willingness to rule out free schools led the DSP to promote the \nrectification of the Presidential decrees that legalized free schools. Taking advantage that Pascual \nOrtiz Rubio had stepped in early in February 1930, the National Academy of Medicine, the \nMexican Medical Association, the Federation of Medical Unions of the Federal District and the \nMedical Union of the Federal District addressed the President with their co ncern about the \nregulation of free schools and they requested the DSP to stop revalidating these schools\u2019 medical \ndegrees until the President responded to these unions and professional societies\u2019 petitions .32 The \nSEP addressed the President with similar demands .33 The SEP\u2019s minister argued two things; first, \nthat in the decree of January 28, there was no time requirement for the duration of high school \nstudies and that the ELHM was the ultimate authority to decide if these where carried out \nproperly; secon d, that the decree validated all degrees issued by the school since its creation, \nwhile the decree warranted the adequate medical training of students who had just started their \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nSP, SJ, 7, 2.

Consequently, he requested a reform to the new decree  that \nacknowledged their demands.  \nThe President decided to stop validating ELHM degrees until the DSP and the SEP \nagreed on what course to follow .34 During the exchanges between the SEP and the DSP, the \nSEP\u2019s legal counselor suggested they stop revalidatin g ELHM\u2019s decrees, but the DSP\u2019s legal \ncounselor, drawing on previous experience dealing with registering ELHM degrees (see chapter \n5), warned that this course would only lead to lawsuits that homeopaths would win, constituting \na precedent that would impose  limits on a later modification of the original decree .35 Regardless \nof both government offices\u2019 agreement on the lack of warrant to the society that the decree of \nJanuary 28 implied ,36 sanitary authorities could prevent the legalization of the free school o f \nhomeopathy. The SEP undertook responsibility to regulate degrees issued by professional \nschools. On March 17, 1932, Pascual Ortiz Rubio reformed the decree of October 22, 1929, \ngiving the UNAM back the academic authority over high school and professional  education .37 \nThis meant that if new private institutions wanted to be authorized by the federal government \ntheir high school and professional academic curricula needed to resemble those of UNAM. Free \nschools previously authorized by the decree of October 2 2, 1929, including the ELHM, had a \nperiod of six months to fulfill the requirements of the new decree and continue as legal \n                                                             \n34 The note \u201cAsuntos que se llevan al acuerdo del C.

With the decree of January 28 giving legal status to the ELHM, this new reform \nintroduced legal inconsistencies that r esulted in lawsuits that the DSP wanted to prevent in the \nfirst place.  \nReforms carried out at the end of the Maximato (1928 \u201334) wanted to give back the UNM \nthe political and administrative position it enjoyed before 1929, yet in terms of the regulation of  \nfree professional schools this resulted in contradictory outcomes. In 1933, the President issued a \nnew Organic Law f or UNAM . This new law had no regulations that specifi ed the relationship \nbetween the university  and free professional school s. The former l aw of 1929 made clear that the \nPresident would be responsible through the SEP to regulate free professional schools. But since \nthe law of 1933 substituted the one of 1929 and since the decree of March 1932 gave academic \nauthority over free professional sch ools, these regulations actually gave back UNAM the \nauthority over all professional education in Mexico City. As I will analyze in chapter 6, these \nwaves of regulations produced a tide of lawsuits from graduates of free professional schools who \nat one time  had made their degrees legal and at another the DSP rejected them as illegal.  \n\u201cSanitizing the Medical Profession\u201d: The Sanitary Code and the Enforcement of the \n\u201cSanitary Dictatorship\u201d  \nThe central role of sanitary authorities after the 1920s was a consequ ence of the push of \ndoctors during the meetings that created the Constitution  of 1917 to turn health into a national \nand constitutional concern. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez argued in the Constitutional Congress of 1917 \nthat \u201cto live well the longest possible time \u201d was an economic and social value beyond the \nindividual and he believed that it was so important that the state had the right to even 190 \n \u201cdespotically intervene on the social and individual hygiene\u201d.38 For him, the \u201csanitary \ndictatorship\u201d, as he called this f orm of intervention, was the only type of dictatorship that \ncivilized countries should tolerate . This view materialized in the Constitution  and in government \nstructures. Article 73 turned the local Superior Council of Health into a consulting group that \nresponded directly to the President, and its executive office, the local Superior Board of Health, \ninto the Department of Public Health [ Departamento de Salubridad P\u00fablica , here on DSP], an \ninstitution with the attributes of a Ministry .39 It did not need to r eport to any other Ministry and \nits dispositions were applicable throughout the country. Moreover, in case of epidemic disease, it \ncould implement preventative measures without notifying the President.  \nIn contrast to the geographically limited legal authority of the UNM, the DSP used its \nprivileged institutional and legal position to carry out regulations intended to control medical \npractice. While the faculty of the National School of Medicine pushed fo r curricular reforms that \nincorporated the most recent medical advances into the training of future generations of medical \ndoctors at the UNM throughout the 1920s, sanitary authorities, which had been trained at the \nuniversity\u2019s medical school, pushed for reforms aimed to control the \u201cfifth plague\u201d or the liberal \npractice of medicine. As graduates from the most prominent medical school of the country at the \ntime, they used ENM\u2019s training as the model to which they referred when assessing what was \nadequate m edical training. They also used the UNM\u2019s degrees as legal documents that \nlegitimized the practice of their holders. This effort was not new. Sanitary authorities had used \nthis criterion since they started implementing sanitary regulations after the Wars o f Reform in \n1871. But their new position allowed them to enforce measures in the 1920s and 30s, whereas \n                                                             \n38 Ernesto Arechiga C\u00f3rdoba, \"\"Dictadura sanitaria\", educaci\u00f3n y prop aganda higi\u00e9nica en el M\u00e9xico \nRevolucionario, 1917 - 1934,\" Dynamis.

This section analyzes the regulations pushed by the DSP \nduring this time frame. Whether practitioners complied wit h them will be discussed in the \nfollowing chapter.  \nUnder the guidance of Rodr\u00edguez, the DSP resumed the former task of regulating the \nmedical profession that sanitary authorities had stopped during the 1910s. First sanitary \nauthorities attempted to enforce  the ruling Sanitary Code in 1920. Alfonso Pruneda, the general \nsecretary of the department, reminded all physicians of their obligations to register their degrees \nwith the department and inform the address of their consulting offices .40 But sanitary author ities \nmight have perceived that the ongoing regulations were not enough to prevent the proliferation \nof irregular practitioners  because three months later the department published a new regulation \nthat went beyond creating a national medical registry. Sani tary authorities now aimed to more \nactively control the medical marketplace by regulating how practitioners advertised their medical \nservices, using the medical degree as the element to distinguish between medical practitioners .41 \nThe new regulation allowed  registered physicians, surgeons, obstetricians, pharmacists, \nodontologists, veterinarians, and homeopaths, to advertise only the services they were entitled to, \naccording to the title they possessed. It was open and clear about what the DSP considered leg al \ndegrees, \u201cthose accepted by the National University and those issued by the School of Medicine \n                                                             \n40 Announcement published in the bulletin of the Department of Public Health on May 28, 1920.

Those who did not want to be subjected to the scrutiny of sanitary authorities or who \ndid not satisfy the latter\u2019s criteria co uld not advertise their services. And those who did fulfill the \nrequirements or criteria of the sanitary authorities had still to clearly state in their advertisements \nthat they practiced without a degree. The legislation gave only thirty days to comply wi th both \nthe registry and the corresponding modification in the advertisements, after which the sanitary \nauthority would charge fines between 5 and 500 Mexican pesos, and remove medical publicity.  \nThe intervention of the DSP in the control of the medical pr ofession clashed with the \nliberal practice of professions granted in article 4 of the Constitution  of 1917. But with the \nsanitary dictatorship as the dominant discourse to implement sanitary measures at the national \nlevel after 1917, the department used th e idea of health as a social good to argue that those who \npracticed medicine without the proper knowledge violated the rights of society. For the sanitary \nauthorities, article 4 was not an obstacle to carry out their measures since they believed that this \narticle provided the public administration with the authority to regulate professions when the \nrights of the society were threatened. Moreover, for them the requirement of a proper medical \ntraining and the provision of specific medical services for w hich a  practitioner was trained , \naccording to his/her degree, did not represent in any way an intr usion to the liberal practice of \n                                                             \n42 Pruneda, \"Por el Departamento de Salubridad P\u00fablica.

While in 1920, the sanitary department only registered \ndegrees from the UNM, the Medical School of the Army, and the National Veterinary School, in \n1923, the DSP only registered degrees from the National University, foreign schools of countries \nwhich had reciprocit y with Mexico, and those issued by state governments, if they complied with \nlocal regulations .44 On March 26, 1925, President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles ratified these guidelines, \nand provided additional ones to cope with free schools. If graduates from free sch ools wanted to \nregister their degrees with the DSP, their schools\u2019 curricula needed to be evaluated and validated \nby the UNM. Otherwise graduates from free schools needed to pass an examination in order to \nreceive degrees from the university .45 \nIn 1924, a n ew political administration brought Doctor Bernardo J. Gastelum as head of \nthe DSP. He initiated a series of reforms that aimed both to increase the central control of the \ndepartment and increase its presence beyond Mexico City. Regardless of DSP\u2019s privile ged \nposition, incongruities between federal and state laws hampered its intervention beyond Mexico \n                                                             \n43 These views of the Department of Public Health are reasons given to the measures taken to control the \nregistry and publicity of medical practitioners in the legislation that appeared in the Diario Oficial, Augu st \n2nd, 1920, in Pruneda, \"Por el Departament o de Salubridad P\u00fablica. Importante para los que ejercen la \nmedicina, la ciruj\u00eda, la farmacia, la obstetricia, la odontolog\u00eda, la medicina veterinaria y la homeopat\u00eda, en \nel Distrito Federal \".  \n44 Apparently the DSP issued new criteria to register degrees o n June 12, 1923. See the letter that the head \nof the office of medical demography sent providing data for the annual presidential report of 1923, dated \non July 12, 1923, in the AHSS SP, S, 8, 11.  \n45 Inform of the DSP, comment 28; see \u00c1lvarez Am\u00e9zquita, Bust amante and Fern\u00e1ndez del Castillo, \nHistoria de la salubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico   254. See also section VIII in the report from the \noffice of medical demography in the \u201cINFOMRE DEL DEPARTAMENTO DE SALUBRIDAD PARA \nEL MENSAJE PRESIDENCIAL DEL 1\u00ba DE SEPTIEMBRE DE 1925\u201d; in the AHSS, SP, S, 9, 15.  194 \n City, and a reduced budget limited material and human resources for its campaigns. Hence the \ndepartment\u2019s efforts were insufficient and remained geographical ly restricted in the mid -1920s. \nGastelum internally reorganized the sanitary department to increase the provision of services at \nthe federal level .46 The new internal regulation of the department clearly specified the institutions \nthat integrated the sanita ry administration, the hierarchy between them, and each one\u2019s \nresponsibilities. These regulations did not literally state the place of the campaign to control \nmedical practice, but the department\u2019s new administrative organization clearly reflected this \ninterest. For this purpose Bernardo Gastelum created a new Office of Medical Practice, \nPropaganda, Hygienic Education, and General Archives, headed by Doctor Conrado Iz\u00e1bal \nIriarte .47 As its name implies, this new office was originally created to study the pop ulation of \nmedical practitioners in the entire country. Its duties included publicizing the DSP\u2019s criteria to \nregister medical degrees with state governments and foreign embassies, registering degrees \nsubmitted to the DSP, and gathering information and mak ing it public about towns that lacked \nmedical doctors and the provisions given the latter who wanted to relocate and provide their \nservices in such towns .48   \n                                                             \n46 For instance, he created thirty two sanitary delegations to carry out the federal government\u2019s new \nfunctions in state capitals and other important cities. Integrated by three doctors (including a \nbacteriolo gist), one pharmaceutical inspector, five sanitary agents, one nurse, and support staff, these \ndelegations added to already established federal health offices in ports and border cities. See See Birn, \nMarriage of Convenience: Rockefeller International Health and Revolutionary Mexico   119. \n47 For the new organization and responsibilities of the Department of Public Health see \u201cNuevo \nreglamento general del Departamento de Salubridad P\u00fablica\u201d and \u201cPersonal sanitario de la Federaci\u00f3n\u201d in \n\u00c1lvarez Am\u00e9zquita, B ustamante and Fern\u00e1ndez del Castillo, Historia de la salubridad y de la asistencia en \nMexico   209-16, and 18, respectively.   \n48 The office was particularly concerned with getting the new criteria to accept medical degrees spread \nout. See \u201cInforme sint\u00e9tico de las labores efectuadas por el Departamento de Salubridad, desde el 1\u00ba de \nseptiembre de 1924 hasta el \u00faltimo d\u00eda de agosto de 1925 en curso\u201d in AHSS, SP, P, S, 9, 15.  195 \n Gast\u00e9lum\u2019s most important achievement during his administration was the formulation of \na new Sanit ary Code, in 1926 (Appendix 2). With this new code, he updated the sanitary \nadministration to cope with the contemporary problems that the nation faced, for  \nhow would it be possible to fit the solutions of today\u2019s problems in the old -\nfashioned model of th e Sanitary Code of 1902, product of the ossified \nadministration, alien to the contemporary social needs and the systematization \nthat modern life imposes, conceived amongst the world of individualistic \ndoctrines of classical liberalism.49 \n \nThe code clarified  the responsibilities that each level of governance had in the sanitary \nadministration .50 Particularly, it left the control of the medical profession in the hands of both \nfederal and state efforts.  \nThe new Sanitary Code incorporated regulations issued duri ng the first half of the 1920s, \nthough if contrasted to the code of 1891 (See Appendixes 1), there were relatively few \ninnovations .51 The most important of these was that the code of 1926 accommodated changes in \nthe administration of professional schools to  prevent the registry of any professional degree from \nfree schools .52 Perhaps paying attention to the conflicts that the DSP faced after 1920 regarding \nthe registration of degrees from free schools (see chapter 5), the new sanitary code was more \nspecific th an previous ones about the types of degrees the department could register. All \ngraduates from the UNM, as well as other official universities sponsored by federal or states\u2019 \n                                                             \n49 \u201cNuevo C\u00f3digo de Salubridad\u201d, in \u00c1lvarez Am\u00e9zquita, Bustamante and Fern\u00e1ndez del Cast illo, \nHistoria de la salubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico   234. \n50 The federal government controlled sanitation in ports, migration, medications and narcotics, \nalcoholism, and children\u2019s hygiene. Federal and state governments in joint authority were resp onsible for \nthe prevention of epidemic diseases, industrial hygiene, and the control of prostitution, and the medical \nprofession. State and local governments were given authority over sanitary engineering, food and \nbeverage hygiene, and transportation heal th. See Birn, Marriage of Convenience: Rockefeller \nInternational Health and Revolutionary Mexico   119. \n51 Both doctors and practitioners without a degree needed to notify their status to the DSP. Both have to \nadvertise their services according to the degree  they had, or the lack of it, and only physicians with a \ndegree could issue death certificates and provide other expert services that demanded a qualified technical \nproficiency.  \n52 See \u00c1lvarez Am\u00e9zquita, Bustamante and Fern\u00e1ndez del Castillo, Historia de la salubridad y de la \nasistencia en Mexico ., p. 249 -50. 196 \n governments, had open access to the department\u2019s registry. Moreover, the National University \nbecame the standard to evaluate adequate medical training. The department allowed the \nregistration of degrees issued by foreign universities or free schools only if the university \nacknowledged the equivalence between their respective curricula. Free schools were a special \ncase. The DSP would only register these schools\u2019 degrees if the National University previously \nacknowledged their existence, approved their curricula, and considered that they had fulfilled \nany other requirement established by t he university.  \nThe new code was more restrictive about the practices that only physicians with a regular \ndegree could perform. While previous codes had only regulated the issuing of death certificates, \nthe new extended regulation over other forms of pract ice where expert knowledge was needed. \nThe issuing of death certificates continued to be a responsibility of physicians with title, unless \nthey found evidence of crime. According to the new code, only registered physicians could be \ncalled as experts, and p erform autopsies in legal cases, prepare bodies for burial, prescribe \nnarcotics, and provide medical certificates. Only they were allowed to be hired in administrative \noffices of scholar hygiene, or legal medicine; or serve as heads of public or private ho spitals, \nclinics, and welfare institutions.  \nThe lack of a general legal framework that regulated professional degrees at the national \nlevel, nevertheless, prevented the coordination between federal and state authorities that would \nenable them to act consistently to control medical practice. The sanitary code acknowledged the \nincongruities between federal and state law, for in every refor m or new regulation, it also \nproposed that there were special conditions in the states. In the case of the control o f medical \npractice, the DSP would accept degrees from official institutions in the states, but these \ninstitutions obeyed state laws regarding professional training and the issuing of degrees that were 197 \n not always followed \u2014 and sometimes even contradicted  \u2014 UNM\u2019s criteria. Since the legal or \notherwise status of a medical degree supported measures with which sanitary authorities aimed \nto deal with medical advertising and the issuing of death certificates, the differences between \nhow Mexico City and other stat es regulated the granting of medical degrees imposed serious \nproblems to the sanitation of medical practice (See chapter 5).   \nBernardo Gastelum acknowledged the limitations of the sanitary code in the control of \nmedical practice, blaming the lack of a reg ulation of article 4 of the Constitution  for such an \noutcome .53 What his denunciation implied was that, to the eyes of sanitary authorities, total \ncentral control of medical practice would n ot be achieved until the state \u2014 with graduates from \nthe National S chool of  medicine at the head \u2014 assumed total control of medical training, pretty \nmuch as it had done it with public health in 1917. Facing difficulties with legally establishing the \nNational University as an institution that centrally controlled medical t raining all over the nation, \nENM graduates used the DSP status to introduce laws that actually acknowledged the university \nas such central institution. By placing the UNM as the cornerstone for adequate professional \nmedical training in the sanitary code, t he DSP attempted to solve the gap created by the lack of \nregulation of article 4, and achieve a certain degree of central regulation and control of medical \npractice.  \nThe DSP used the Office of Demography and Medical Practice, as well as the newly \ncreated s anitary delegations to achieve this central control. After the Sanitary Code was reformed \nin 1926, rather than passively waiting for degrees to arrive to the central office in Mexico City, \nthe office used the newly created sanitary delegations to police pr ofessional practice. It now had \n\u201cAgents of the Sanitary Police\u201d and \u201cDelegates of the Department\u201d who, respectively, policed \n                                                             \n53 \u201cNuevo C\u00f3digo de Salubridad\u201d, in \u00c1lvarez Am\u00e9zquita, Bustamante and Fern\u00e1ndez del Castillo, \nHistoria de la salubridad y de la asistencia en Mexico   249-50. 198 \n advertisements in Mexico City, or gathered information about those who practiced medicine in \nthe countryside .54 In the Federal Distr ict, the \u201cAgents of the Sanitary Police\u201d monitored public \nadvertisements in Mexico City, Tacuba, Tacubaya and Mixcoac, contrasted them with the \nmedical registry, and informed the DSP\u2019s Office of Legal Affairs of those medical practitioners \nwho broke the la w.55 The DSP\u2019s subhead, Roberto Medell\u00edn, addressed state governors to gather \ninformation about medical practitioners\u2019 addresses, type of healing services provided (literally \n\u201callopathic or homeopathic\u201d), graduating institutions, and registration status (wh ether in the DSP \nor with the state government). Throughout the second half of the 1920s, he constantly \ncorresponded with sanitary delegations and state and local governments requesting this \ninformation .56 Once the new Sanitary Code was issued, he requested to sanitary delegates that a \ncopy of Chapter 4 \u2014 the one about medical practice  \u2014 was \u201cposted in a visible place in [every \nsanitary] delegation\u201d, and to governors that the new regulations on the registry of titles were \ncommunicated to municipal governments  and medical practitioners .57 The office also used \nnational newspapers to inform doctors about their need to register or provide the DSP with their \naddresses .58 \nApparently, the enforcement of the Sanitary Code was gradual and not coercive.

In 1926, the Office of \nDemography and Medical P ractice only received 400 pesos in fines. Considering that a practitioner who \nadvertised a \u201cdoctor\u201d without having a title registered with the DSP was fined with 50 pesos, the amount \nof 400 pesos would imply only 6 cases of infringement of the code in matt ers of professional practice. \nFrom 1926 to 1927, it only received 100 pesos on fines.

For instance, the \ncensus of 1910 listed 714 doctors in Mexico City, while the medical registry of 1907 counted \n554 (See Table 2).64 While it is still difficult to account for an increase of 160 doctors in just \nthree years, this difference w as minimal contrasted to figures for the entire nation. The national \ncensus of 1910 listed 3021 doctors, while the medical registry of 1925 had only 1220. Yet the \nDSP\u2019s efforts to break the breach paid off. In 1923, 1924, and 1926, the DSP registered 146, 142 \nand 257 medical doctors. Just in July 1929, it registered 420 .65 Overall, the DSP general medical \ndirectory, which was put together with the information of the medical registry, tripled the \nnumber of medical doctors from 1925 to 1929 (See Table 2). The number of doctors who failed \nto register and medical practitioners who lacked a titled started to appear in DSP\u2019s records. In \n1926, there were twelve petitions to register titles that were rejected by the DSP and nine \nregistered practitioners without a title ;66 in 1929, these numbers increased to 140 and 84, \nrespectively .67 These statistics evidence the increasing effort of the central sanitary department \nand satellite sanitary delegations to have a better representation of the medical services provided \nin the entire nation. Whether this representation was accurate is hard t o assess, but the fact that \nthe medical directory had in 1929 the number of doctors counted by the national census in 1910 \n                                                             \n64 For the statistics of 1910 see Table: \u201cProfesionistas de ciertas clases en las entidades federativas.

File 20.  202 \n Furthermore, what sanitary authorities found in their effort to impose their criteria to \nsanitize the profession was how far they were from professionalizing medical practice at the \nnatio nal level. For instance, Enrique Garc\u00eda Moreno, the sanitary inspector of \u201cLa Magdalena \nContreras\u201d, a municipality located 10 miles south from Mexico City, reported that there were \nonly seven medical practitioners, no hospitals, and only a very basic clini c that took care of the \ninjured workers of \u201cLa Magdalena\u201d and \u201cSanta Teresa\u201d factories in the region in the early \n1930s .68 The medical services provided in a geographical region so close to Mexico City, the \neconomic, political, and cultural center of the co untry, provides a scenario which allows us to \nimagine the situation of other towns or villages located in the hinterland, far away from any \nmajor city. While DSP\u2019s records reflected an overwhelming majority of registered physician -\nsurgeons over homeopaths,  practitioners without title, and doctors with title that the DSP did not \nregister (a figure of 3067 vs. 94 vs. 152 vs. 93, in 1929), the structure of the community of \nmedical practitioners in La Magdalena Contreras might have better resembled the structur e of \nother town and villages\u2019 medical communities in the country side. In La Magdalena Contreras, \nthere were only three doctors who possessed a title and four who practiced without it. Dr. Pedro \nGarc\u00eda Mosqueda was a graduate from the National University, but he was not registered; Dr. \nIsmael Ramos Alarc\u00f3n, a graduate from the ENMH was the only registered physician in town; \nand Eduardo Spude had an authorization by the government of the state of Morelos, and though \nhe argued that he had a title from a Germa n medical school, he was not able to show evidence of \nit. Half of the practitioners without a title were homeopaths. San \u00c1ngel, a neighboring \nmunicipality just a couple of miles closer to Mexico City, had two homeopaths registered in the \nDSP, out of a tota l of nine physicians who practiced in the region, discounting Eduardo Spude \n                                                             \n68 Correspondence to the head of the DSP. AHSS, SP, EM, 11, 10, pp. 172.  203 \n who was already listed in La Magdalena Contreras\u2019 list and appeared also in the list of San \n\u00c1ngel .69 \nThe important presence of homeopaths in Mexico was underrepresented in the medical \nregistry and directories; for the latter was less a representation of homeopaths\u2019 demography in \nMexico in the 1920s, than an indicator of the marginalizing politics of sanitary authorities \nregarding medical practice. This comes up particularly if t he registry is analyzed in detail and \ncontrasted to other sources of information for doctors who graduated in free medical schools. \nGraduates from the ENMH, who possessed a legal medical degree, were heavily \nunderrepresented in the medical registry in the early 1920s (See Graph 2). Only approximately \n12.5% of them were registered. Yet apparently, the DSP enforcement of the Sanitary Code and \nthe regulations in the early 1920s that aimed to promote physicians\u2019 compliance with the \nregistration worked for ENMH graduates. By the mid 1920s, one third of them were registered .70 \nIt is worth noting that most of the new entries in the medical registry were graduates from the \nschool when this was incorporated to the UNM. This suggests that, in statistical terms, the \ncentralization of medical schools within the university was useful for recent homeopathic \ngraduates. They were willing to comply with the UNM\u2019s and the DSP\u2019s regulations and be \nincorporated into the profession\u2019s institutional life. However, this also suggests  that the DSP\u2019s \nstrategy did not work for former ENMH graduates, who did not comply with the registry .71  \n                                                             \n69 Sanitary inspection\u2019s list of medical practitioners of the muni cipality of San \u00c1ngel, no date.

As their doctrinarian \npeers, ELHM graduates sought to comply with the registry in their own terms  (see chapter 5). \nThis meant that they wanted th e DSP to recognize their school as a regular training institution \nwith the authority to grant medical degrees. The regulation did not allow this. Consequently, if \nthey wanted to be part of the DSP\u2019s medical registry, they would have to undertake a long \nprocess of examinations at the UNM .72 If they wanted to notify the DSP about their practice but \nnot go through the examining process, they had to advertise their services as practitioners with \nno medical degree. The DSP\u2019s exclusionary policies left ELHM gradua tes out of the registry \nduring the 1920s (See Graph 2) .73 Only seldom, homeopaths with foreign degrees were \nregistered .74 Homeopaths from other free schools or homeopathic schools located in the \ncountryside were never registered in the first half of the 1920 s.75 In other words, the medical \n                                                             \n72 That this represented a complicated process for them is exemplified by brothers Garc\u00eda Trevino\u2019s case \nand by the relative high rate of ENMH graduates that revalidated their degree after the ENMH became \npart of the university.  \n73 No ELHM graduate went into the DSP medical registry before 1929.

Jemmall\u2019s degree from the New York Homeopathic Medical College was revalidated \nby the State of Yucat\u00e1n and registered in 1925. See AHSS, SSA. DGAJ.

Only the Free Homeopathic Institute of Mexico accounted for 26. None of them got \ninto the DSP medical r egistry during the 1920s. Only one homeopath graduated from the National \nUniversity of the Southwest [ Universidad Nacional del Sureste ] was registered in 1927. See AHSS. \nSecretar\u00eda de Salubridad y Asistencia.

The Dean of the National University of the Southwest in Merida, Yucat\u00e1n, \nEduardo Urz\u00e1is, created a Faculty of Homeopathy on March 17, 1922. The registry recorded only the first \ntwo graduates from this school in 1929. See \u201cSe crea la escuela especial de medicina homeop\u00e1tica en el 206 \n registry is a reflection of how sanitary authorities wanted the medical profession\u2019 demographics \nto be rather than an accurate picture of it. In this sense, it was a reflection of the DSP\u2019s policies \nto sanitize the professio n. While criteria there were criteria to incorporate irregular practitioners \ninto the medical registry in the sanitary code, practitioners were not willing to comply with them, \nmaking the Sanitary Code a tool of exclusion in the 1920s.  \nAs I analyzed above , the transition to the 1930s hindered sanitary authorities\u2019 hope for a \ncoherent regulatory framework that allowed them to homogenize criteria for the medical registry \nat the national level. In 1926, the national press considered that \u201cthere were complaint s \neverywhere against the Department of Public Health\u201d, but no public conference, newspaper \npropaganda or lawsuit produced a slight change in sanitary authorities\u2019 attitude.76 Even courts \nsided on the DSP\u2019s criteria, for no legal demand passed over the new code, according to some \nnewspapers . But, while this was true in some cases, particularly with the one of the ELHM in the \nmid-1920s, later in the 1920s and during the 1930s th is was no t always the case (see chapter 6 ). \nThe state intervention in the regulation of professional free schools, particularly the ELHM, was \na direct blow against DSP\u2019s purposes, for instance. Without the UNM as a regulatory institution \nsince 1929 and the  SEP\u2019s need to comply with the decree that made free professional schools \nlegal from 1929 to 1932, the DSP turned into an institution that policed professional medical \ntraining during the first y ears of the 1930s (see chapter 6 ). Yet the window of opportun ity at the \nturn of the 1930s allowed that medical doctors graduated from free professional schools found \ntheir way into the medical registry. The medical registry during the 1930s evidences the tensions \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nestado de Yucat\u00e1n.\u201d, in \"La Sociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1tica de Yucat\u00e1n, solicita la creaci\u00f3n de la Escuela \nEspecial de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica,\" 140.  \n76 Comment published in the newspaper diary El Sol , July 12, 1926; in \u201cAmparos contra el C\u00f3digo \nSanitario\u201d in \u00c1lvarez Am\u00e9zquita, Bustamante and Fern\u00e1ndez del Castillo, Historia de la salubridad y de la \nasistencia en Mexico   273. 207 \n between these two trends, the DSP\u2019s active role in re jecting degrees from free schools and the \nlong time the Supreme Court took to give a verdict in favor of them.  \nThe medical registry during the 1930s is a reflection of the inconsistencies in the \nregulation of the professional education in Mexico and the l awsuits that graduates from free \nprofessional schools won. The law that authorized the ELHM brought waves of graduates to \nvalidate their degrees with the SEP and request their registration to the DSP (See Graph 3). By \nJanuary 30, 1930, only two weeks after  President Portes Gil authorized the legality of the \nELHM, the SEP had validated 95 doctors of homeopathy; 36 more the following week; and 25 \nmore on August 20 .77 The DSP registered 155 titles in 1930, 80% of which were registered in the \nfirst two months af ter the decree was issued. Moreover, the ELHM had graduated 200 students \nby 1930, and 75% of them were registered by the end of that year, transforming the structure of \nthe population of homeopathic physicians acknowledged by the DSP. While in 1929, the me dical \nregistry included only 36 homeopathic physicians graduated from the ENMH, 2 from other \nnational schools, and 3 from international schools, in 1930, the ELHM was the single \nhomeopathic school that added 155 to the number of registered homeopaths. In s ubsequent years \nthe rate of registration decreased to 15 graduates per year, and in 1933, sanitary authorities stop \nregistering ELHM\u2019s titles. From 1934 to 1937 only 3 homeopaths from this school were \nregistered .78 Backed up by UNAM\u2019s Organic Law of 1933, t he DSP denied the registry to titles \nissued by private medical schools. A small number of graduates from other schools were  \nregistered through d ifferent means from 1930 to 1942 .79 The registry shows an important \n                                                             \n77 Correspondence from authorities from the SEP to the head of the DSP, Januar y 30, February 3, and \nAugust 21, 1930, in AHSS, SP, EM, 10, 26, pp. 3, 4, 6.  \n78 All of them obtained as a consequence of a Supreme Court verdict.  \n79 2 from the Free School of Homeopathy of Puebla, 10 from other homeopathic medical schools beyond \nMexico City  (the government of Yucat\u00e1n, the School of Homeopathic Medicine of Yucat\u00e1n, and the \nSchool of Homeopathic Medicine of Jalisco), and 2 from foreign schools (the Hahnemann Homeopathic 208 \n increment of homeopathic medical doctors in 1 938 and the following years (See Graph 3). From \n1933 to 1937, the increase in homeopathic medical doctors is accounted by ENMH graduates. \nDuring these years, the DSP did not accept ELHM\u2019s \u2014 or any other free schools\u2019  \u2014 degrees as \na consequence of UNAM\u2019s Or ganic Law of 1933, leaving the ENMH as the single homeopathic \nschool in a legal status. The sharp increase in 1938 is accounted by 53 ELHM degrees either \nrevalidated by the SEP or registered by an order of the Supreme Court. From 1939 to 1941, 37 \ngraduates  from the Free Homeopathic Institute of Mexico registered their degree, once again as a \nresult of a verdict from the Supreme Court .80  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nCollege of Philadelphia and the Collegium Medicinae Thompsonianae from All enton).

In 1934, the DSP did not register Isaac D\u00edaz Espinosa\u2019s title; in 1935, Ernesto Guill\u00e9n Ur\u00eda was \nfined for using the word \u201cdoctor\u201d in his medical ads; and in the same year sanitary authorities did not \nallow Petra Guzm\u00e1n Barron to open a homeopathic dispensary. All of them sued the sanitary department \nwith no success, but only the first two obtained their registry in 1939 and 1940 respectively. The case of \nthe registration of  titles issued by the ILHM was exceptional; when four of its graduates sued the DSP for \nnot registering their titles in 1942, the SCJN\u2019s verdict argued that the school was not officially recognized \nby the SEP and that the former recognition of this school\u2019 s titles did not allow the SEP to perpetuate its \nerror.

C\u00e1rdenas term \nevidenced a wave of activism from professional groups to regulate professional life. They \ncreated the National Confederation of Professional Associations (CNAP) in 1934 .81 This \nconfederation organized congresses that pushed for the regulation of article 4. The C\u00e1mara d e \nDiputados initiated a project to gather opinions from several professional groups, including \nhomeopaths, about how to elaborate such a regulation .82 Yet led by university physicians, this \nproject also dismissed homeopaths from the discussions .83 The second  congress held in 1937 \ncreated the National Office to Control and Register Profession Schools and its Degrees \n(ONCRETP). President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas created the National Polytechnic Institute in 1936. He \n                                                             \n81 For the creation of the CNAP and the ONCRE TP and a brief analysis of the regulation of professions in \nthe second half of the 1930s, see Moreno, Yankee Don't Go Home! : Mexican Nationalism, American \nBusiness Culture, and the Shaping of Modern Mexico, 1920 -1950   22-3. \n82 The interest to regulate arti cle 4 of the constitution dated back to 1917, yet this interest came from \nprofessional groups rather than legislators. In the early 1930s, legislators started to approach professional \nsocieties to request for their opinions, but the project was never final ized; for instance see AHSS, SP, SJ, \n12, 13 and 30, 1, pp. 190, and AHSS, SP, EM, 4, 14. In 1934, with the new President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas \nleading the country, legislators undertook the project; see homeopath Manuel M\u00e1rquez San Juan\u2019s \n\u201cContribuci\u00f3n al studio  de la reglamentaci\u00f3n de las profesiones en M\u00e9xico\u201d in AHSS, SP, SJ, 29, 14.

A detailed \nanalysis of this process remains to be investigated.   \nThe DSP kept up with the regulatory shift during C\u00e1rdenas presidential term, reforming \nthe Sanitary Code in 1934. The section on medical practice (See Appendix 3) did not radically \ndiffer from the code o f 1926, yet it introduced new articles that gave the DSP authority over local \nstate governments regarding how to regulate medical practice; accommodated the criteria to \naccept medical titles from free schools according to the contemporary situation of the \nadministration of professional education; and restricted even further medical advertising and \npractice. The DSP still acknowledged the authority of state governments to regulate professional \ntraining and degree granting, but article 442 was clear that it w as DSP\u2019s single responsibility to \n\u201cdictate government resolutions regarding the practice of medical sciences and related \nactivities.\u201d86 In terms of medical degrees, though the new code acknowledged that the National \nUniversity was no longer the institution that validated degrees from free schools, it also \n                                                             \n84 See for  instance Roberto Rodr\u00edguez G\u00f3mez and Imanol Ordorika Sacrist\u00e1n, \"The Chameleon's Agenda: \nEntrepreneuralization of Private Higher Education in Mexico,\" Universities and the Public Sphere: \nKnowledge Creation and State Building in the Era of Globalization (I nternational Studies in Higher \nEducation) , eds.

The code was unspecific enough to make clear that federal \ninstitutions that authorized free professional schools changed through time, but that the DSP \nwould only accept these schools\u2019 degrees when the federal institu tion had the legal right to \nauthorize them. As I will analyze in chapter 6, this condition helped the DSP to actually police \nmedical training.  \nIn terms of advertisements, the new code detailed how doctors and practitioners should \nadvertise their services.  Every registered practitioner had to advertise their services stating, \u201cwith \nno abbreviations, the legally authorized sc hool that issued their degrees\u201d  (article 446). \nUnregistered practitioners had to explicitly advertise that they \u201cpracticed without a de gree\u201d [\u201cse \nejerce sin t\u00edtulo\u201d] (article 447). And if registered practitioners used a therapeutic approach which \nthey were not qualified to provide , they needed to advertise that they lacked the degree to use \nsuch a therapy. Since sanitary authorities ackno wledged that the code could not regulate the \ngranting of medical degrees, they increased the restrictions to the practice of unregistered \npractitioners. The code (article 448) made clear that these regulations would also be applicable in \nstates where the p ractice without a medical degree was allowed. Moreover, the code held owners \nof \u201cnewspapers, radio stations, or experimental stations that offered publicity through radio, \nprojection, or any other means\u201d responsible for publicity that contravened the sanit ary \nregulations of medical publicity (article 449). Stating clearly and openly practitioners\u2019 \nprofessional status and their academic training in a particular therapeutic approach in public \nmedical advertisements was, hence, a public health matter.87  \n                                                             \n87 Taken from \u201cUn dique al ejercicio de la medicina por charlatanes\u201d, El Universal , September 2, 1934, \nreprinted in \"Los Charlatanes y el Nuevo C\u00f3digo Sanitario.\"  213 \n In ter ms of medical practice, this code eliminated exemptions that the previous one \nallowed, responding to local regulations. Only registered physicians all over the country, with no \nexceptions, were required to issue death certificates even in cases of murder, and allowed to offer \ntheir professional services as medical experts in private and public institutions (articles 451 and \n452). The new code added an article (455) that delineated a code of conduct for practitioners .88 \nThis required all physicians to coopera te with sanitary authorities during an epidemic outbreak; \npharmacists to provide what the prescription required and to dispense medicine only to registered \npractitioners; registered practitioners to prevent sharing their consulting offices with irregulars;  \nand government institutions to stop issuing professional degrees if they lacked any legal \nauthorization. Previous codes had not considered the particular case of homeopathy. The new \ncode regarded this therapeutic approach in a distinctively way in terms o f the prescription of \nmedicines. Article 413 specified that homeopaths could prescribe narcotic drugs only in \nhomeopathic doses, but the section III of article 452 stated that only registered physicians, \nincluding dentists, veterinarians, and midwifes, but  not homeopaths, could prescribe narcotics \ndrugs. This contradiction indicated the unfruitful efforts to contain the \u201cfifth plague\u201d, as \nrepresented by homeopaths, at the turn of the 1930s.  \nConclusions  \nThe report from Antonio P\u00e9rez Alcocer in 1936 with whic h I initiated this chapter and the \nreforms of the sanitary code of 1934 to control medical practice offer a good contrast and \nopportunity to weigh the DPS\u2019s efforts to control professional practice during the 1920s and 30s. \nOn one hand, I have analyzed how  the revolution brought public health into a central government \nconcern and the government office that administered it, the DSP, into the government institutions \n                                                             \n88 It was a code of conduct in the sense that though the code stated that the person who did not fulfill these \nobligations infringed federal law and attempted against the rights of the society, it is not clear to me how \nthe DSP could prevent such infractions  and if it had legal resources to do it.  214 \n aimed to rule the country. This unprecedented position gave university physicians means throug h \nwhich they aimed to impose their view on how to regulate the practice of medicine. Regarded as \na public health threat, as \u201cthe fifth plague\u201d, sanitary authorities designed a series of strategies to \ncontain the practice of those who did not fit their stan dards of training. Reforms to the sanitary \ncode, the expansion of sanitary services that were used to police the enforcement of the sanitary \ncode and, hence, medical practice, and negotiations with the SEP to standardize criteria for \nvalidating, endorsing,  and legalizing medical degrees, were all strategies to cope with the \nproblem sanitary authorities and university physicians called \u201cmedical charlatanism\u201d. These \nefforts were productive, at first glance. The level of detail in the reforms to the section of  \nmedical practice in the sanitary code, the role of sanitary delegates in the states and the sanitary \npolice in Mexico City, and the increasing number of physicians who registered with the DSP \nshow that the effort of sanitary authorities were not worthless  and that they sanitized the \nprofession to some extent.  \nOn the other hand, the changing role of the UNM with the political power promoted \nreforms that hindered DSP\u2019s efforts to control medical practice. The university\u2019s agenda \ncoincided with the DSP\u2019s dur ing the first half of the 1920s, a situation evidenced in the sanitary \ncode of 1926, yet the rupture of the UNM with the state in 1929 and the renegotiation of this \nrelationship in 1933 motivated a series of irregularities that the sanitary code of 1934 ai med to \nremediate. By reading DSP\u2019s efforts vis -\u00e0-vis the state\u2019s efforts to regulate professional degrees \nin Mexico City, sanitary measures to control medical practice seem less successful. They suggest \nthat the increasing detail in the section of medical practice of the sanitary code, the increasing \npresence of the sanitary police in Mexico City and in the states, and the increased population of \nhomeopathic medical doctors in the registry were a consequence of the lack of actual control of 215 \n the medical prof ession. Without the ability to regulate the granting of medical degrees, sanitary \nauthorities, as P\u00e9rez Alcocer argued, could not be held responsible for the health of the Mexican \npopulation. Moreover, that his complain t was raised in 1936, two years after  the new sanitary \ncode was issued, is telling of the DSP\u2019s limitations to sanitize the medical profession.  \nBesides the conflicts between the UNM and the federal government, there were other \npolitical processes that limited the action of sanitary authoriti es. One was the regulation of article \n4 of the Constitution . Though I have slightly touched upon some of the actors and conflicts that \nthis process motivated during the 1930s, its study is beyond the scope of this dissertation. Further \nresearch needs to be  carried out to understand the role of the activism of medical unions in the \nconfiguration of the Congress of Professionals [ Congreso de Profesionistas ], the negotiations \nwith the Congress and its projects to regulate article 4, and the intervention of the se groups and \nthe SEP in the creation of the National Office to Control and Register Profession Schools and its \nDegrees.  \nThe other one was the role of graduates from the ELHM and other free medical schools. \nFrom chapter 3, we learned that the regulatory e fforts of the UNM first, and the SEP afterwards, \nboth the ENMH and most importantly the ELHM kept up with curricular updates and facility \nimprovement that advances in medical science demanded throughout the 1920s and 30s. In this \nchapter, we learned that t he ENMH\u2019s privileged position within state institutions prevented its \ngraduates from the marginalization that the sanitation of medical practice implied. In this \ncontext, it was graduates from free schools the ones who opposed to DSP\u2019s regulatory measures.  \nAs I will show in the next chapter, their political activism led them to contest the authority of \nboth the UNM and the DSP. This, in turn, influenced sanitary regulations of medical practice and \nthe regulation of professional degrees.  216 \n Chapter 5 . Between \u201cthe Sword of Public Health and the Wall of the University\u201d: The Free \nSchool of Homeopathy of Mexico Contests the \u201cSanitary Dictatorship\u201d, 1920 \u201330 \nOn June 1919, a large group of graduates from the National School of Medicine [ENM] \ngathered to create the Mexican Medical Association [ Asociaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mexicana , AMM] \n\u201cwith the firm purpose to work towards the union of all physicians in the republic and procure \nthe high ideal of improving physicians\u2019 moral, intellectual, and material conditions. \u201d1 According \nto Gregorio Mendiz\u00e1bal, President of the AMM, there were several causes that motivated such \nunifying attempt among which were the \u201cunprecedented proportions achieved by the illegal \npractice of the profession and what might be called legal char latanism amongst physicians with \ndegree, which increases everyday greatly harming the interests of the serious physician and the \nprestige of the profession.\u201d2 Two years later, the AMM defined homeopathy as one of the \nprincipal actors that motivated the lac k of unity of the profession when the Bulletin published the \nwork of Gabino Barreda that criticized homeopathy and subsequently a critique of the merger of \nthe National School of Homeopathic Medicine [ENMH] with the National University of Mexico \n                                                             \n1 The new Association gathered more than 200 physicians, most of them from Mexico City, but there \nwere alos members from Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Quer\u00e9taro, Guanajuato, Aguascalientes, Zacatecas, Coahuila, San \nLuis Potos\u00ed, Puebla, Veracruz and Tamaulipas. Some of those who lived in Mexico City were key actors \nin the struggle to marginalize homeopathic medical schools and the practice of their graduates. Among \nthem were former and future heads of the National School of Medicine, i.e. Guillermo Parra, Rosendo \nAmor, Fernand o Ocaranza; faculty such as Daniel V\u00e9lez, and Manuel Godoy \u00c1lvarez; sanitary authorities \nsuch as \u00c1ngel Brioso Vasconcelos, Alfonso Pruneda, and Francisco Castillo N\u00e1jera; just to mention a \nfew. The Association intended to unionize physicians around 1) a co de of ethics that 2) promoted the \nproduction and diffusion of medical science, 3) created the structure to offer financial support and 5) \nvenues to socialize and promote physical culture to its members. The Bulletin of the Association fulfilled \nthe 6th purpose which was to publicize the Association\u2019s activities. See \"Asociaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mexicana.

When ENM faculty achieved the curricular uniformity within \nthe university, the AMM initiated a campaign to attack graduates from the Free School of \nHomeopathy [ELHM]. ELHM graduates had created the Union of Homeopathic Physicians of \nthe Fede ral District by the end of the 1910s and as such helped organize the Regional \nConfederation of Workers of Mexico [ Confederaci\u00f3n Regional de Obreros de M\u00e9xico , CROM] \nin 1918 .4 In 1924, the CROM denounced that  \nthe Medical Union [referring to the AMM] which grouped both alopaths and \nhomeopaths from state schools [\u2026] had established a clear and strict campaign \nagainst [homeopathic physicians graduated in free schools], who the former \nconsidered as incapable of practi cing the honest medical profession.5 \n  \nThe CROM\u2019s intervention aimed to \u201cavoid a profound division in [the medical] profession, \nbecause such division would translate into negative consequences not only for workers but for \nsociety in general.\u201d6  The creatio n of professional medical unions, the calls for unity, the actions \ntaken by ENM faculty against the ENMH, and the tensions between the former and the ELHM \ncontradictorily attest to the \u201cprofound division\u201d that the CROM perceived.  \n                                                             \n3 The Bulletin published in several issues Gabino Barreda\u2019s \u201cLa homeopat\u00eda o juicio cr\u00edtico sobre este \nnuevo sistema\u201d startin g in Asociaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mexicana.

The policies imposed by the DSP and the UNM to \ncontrol medical practice and training and that resulted in the marginalization of graduates from \nfree s chools and, particularly, ELHM graduates , led to the  latter\u2019s political organization as a \ndistinct professional group. As such, they looked for venues to contest the marginalizing policies \nimposed by both DSP and UNM authorities. Their resistance was effec tive in the sense that they \nwere able to obtain the validation of their degrees and their inclusion in the medical registry. \nHowever, ENM graduates who later occupied key positions at the UNM and the DSP did not \nacknowledge ELHM graduates\u2019 status as medica l doctors.  The regulatory inconsistency between \ndifferent levels of government, i.e. federal, state and local, and the lack of enforcement of \nregulations that were applicable throughout these levels allowed ELHM graduates to privately \npractice medicine and  in some cases issue death certificates, just as homeopathic practitioners \ndid in the 19th century. But they were not incorporated into the state structure in the sense that \nneither the UNM sanctioned their training nor the DSP acknowledged them as medical doctors. \nOnly when the Mexican state broke its relationship with the UNM, the ELHM and other free \nschools turned into the political force that the state used to downsize the political power gained \nby the university during the decade. In this sen se, while the AMM promoted unity, its \nmarginalizing ideologies altogether with the state intervention eventually led to perpetuate the \ndivide the AAM wanted to avoid.  \nThis chapter analyzes the forms of resistance of homeopaths since their arrival in Mexic o \nin the mid -19th century to the year 1930, when President Emilio Portes Gil issued a decree that \nmade the ELHM a legal institution. The purpose is to show that homeopaths\u2019 resistance provides \na way to measure the limits of professional regulation. Homeopa ths nature as both regular and 219 \n irregular practitioners and their struggles to belong to the medical profession and be \nacknowledged as such shows that the dispute between homeopaths and al lopaths was a political \nrather than an epistemological one. Consequen tly, resistance, marginalization, professional \ncontrol, and regulation were deeply influenced by the specific state policies in each historical \nperiod, the state structures generated to implement such policies, and the particular position of \nthese two prof essional medical groups within these state structures. This chapter, hence, shows \nhow homeopathy evolved as a social movement that resisted the hegemonic process of \nprofessionalization from the mid -19th century to the 1920s.  \nThe origins of homeopaths\u2019 res istance in the 19th century  \nThe transition from the Porfirian  to the revolutionary state marked a shift not only in \npublic health governance and legislation but also in how doctors and practitioners responded to \nsuch a change. During the Porfiriato and par ticularly after the sanitary code was issued in 1891, \nsanitary authorities found it difficult to enforce the registration of  medical doctors in Mexico \nCity. This was a way of resistance I will call passive. Doctors contested sanitary authority by \nrefusing to comply with the medical registry. As I analyzed in the previous chapter, a larger \nnumber of doctors in the countryside , in contrast to Mexico City , passively resisted to sanitary \nmeasures to regulate the medical profession at the turn of the 20th centur y. In contrast, there were \npractitioners who actively protested against t he intervention of government authorities in the \nliberal practice of medicine. During the Porfiriato , this active resistance did not go beyond \nscattered complaints or even lawsuits , most of which sided on the liberal practice of medicine as \nstated in article 3 of the Constitution  of 1857. This meant that regardless of sanitary authorities\u2019 \naim to regulate medical practice through the creation of a medical registry and the restriction t o \nissue death certificates to registered physicians, the government privileged individual liberties 220 \n over sanitary intervention for the sake of the social good. But after 1917, with a new Constitution  \nand government structure, sanitary authorities\u2019 enforcement of the sanitary code on matters of \nmedical practice motivated a more organized and consistent form of active resistance.  \nAs a consequence of their status either as foreign physicians or as domes tic healers who \ndid not receive training at the ENM, homeopaths found it difficult to comply with local \nregulations during the second half of the 19th century, yet they found venues to either become \nregistered physicians or continue their private practice.  For instance, in 1859, Ram\u00f3n Comellas \nand Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3 were listed as registered physicians who both practiced homeopathy and had \n\u201cdegrees from other parts\u201d .7 Both homeopaths had been registered because the President in turn, \nAntonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Ana, had  specifically requested the local Superior Board of Health to act \nagainst current sanitary legislation. At the time, physicians needed to undertake an examination \nby ENM\u2019s faculty and they needed to have lived in Mexico City for at least two years. Both \nComellas and Carb\u00f3 were not examined by the local faculty, yet made it into the registry as \nconsequence of Santa Ana\u2019s intervention .8 What the registry\u2019s categorization suggests \u2014 they \nwere explicitly catalogued as \u201cauthorized by the supreme government with degrees obtained \nelsewhere\u201d9 \u2014 is the board\u2019s discomfort as a consequence of being subjected to Presidential \ndecisions in matters of medical practice. This is even more evident by highlighting that there was \n                                                             \n7 Reyes, \"M\u00e9dicos, cirujanos, farmac\u00e9uticos, dentistas, flebotomianos, y parteras.\"  \n8 See Comellas\u2019 request to the Superior Board of Health to register his title in AHENM, CSS, 30, 6, pp. 2 -\n3. Carb\u00f3\u2019s case was slightly different. While Comellas at least tried to be examined by Mexican faculty, \nCarb\u00f3 wanted to be exempted from such examinat ions. The Superior Board of Health complained about \nthe kind of requests he made and the documents he showed to proof his professional training. \nAccordingly he first requested to practice homeopathic medicine in December, 1853. The board rejected \nthe petit ion, and one month later, after getting the documents he needed to proof his training, he requested \nto be exempted from the examination. The board regarded his petitions as both illegal and indicative of \nhis unwillingness to proof his command of medical sc ience. See Jos\u00e9 Carb\u00f3\u2019s petition to practice \nmedicine in the Mexican Republic. AHENM, CSS, 31, 1, pp. 1 -4. The Superior Board of Health \ndescribed the legal situation of homeopaths living in Mexico City at the time, including Comellas\u2019 and \nCarbo\u2019s in the co rrespondence with the governor of Mexico City, July 3, 1855 and July 13, 1855; in \nAHSS, SP, EM, 2, 36.  \n9 Reyes, \"M\u00e9dicos, cirujanos, farmac\u00e9uticos, dentistas, flebotomianos, y parteras.\"  221 \n one other physician, Pascual Bielsa, who openly practiced homeopathy and owned a \nhomeopathic dispensary in 1859, yet was included in the registry but not distinguished as a \nhomeopath ;10 or that there were homeopaths, such as Narciso Sanchiz who could not actually \nmake it to the registry .11  Comellas\u2019 and Carbo\u2019s actions constitute one subclass of active \nresistance, one that trained physicians who did not comply with local sanitary regulations \nundertook. These physicians did have a regular, academic medical training and their actions \nsuggest that they wante d to become part of the growing medical marketplace, one that the \nsanitary legislation wanted to regulate restricting the participation of new actors, such as \nhomeopaths or foreign physicians.  \nWhen the homeopathic community fragmented at the turn of the 1 870s and homeopathic \nphysicians sought for legal venues to become active members of the larger medical community \n(see chapter 2), homeopaths who lacked an ENM\u2019s degree sought other ways to resist sanitary \nstrategies that marginalized their practices. Facin g the enforcement of sanitary regulation in \n1871 ,12 Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez struggled to remain in charge of his homeopathic dispensary .13 The legal \n                                                             \n10 See for instance Pascual Bielsa, \"Discurso de Pascual Bielsa en el 110 aniversario del natalicio de \nHahneman,\" El propagador homeop\u00e1tico  I.2 (octubre, 1870).  The Sanitary Board of Health authorized his \nhomeopathic dispensary on 1858; see AHSS, SP, EM, 3, 53.  \n11 Narciso Sanchiz was a Spanish homeopath, who apparently had gr aduated as Doctor in medicine and \nsurgery from Valencia and Madrid. See AHENM, CSS, 31, 9, pp. 1 -7 (The catalogue referred that \n\u201cNarchiso S\u00e1nchez y Rubio\u201d petitioned an examination from the ENM\u2019s faculty, yet the documents in the \nfile were from Dr. Gamble) . He petitioned a written examination instead of an oral one to the Superior \nSanitary Board in January 1855, since he had \u201clost his voice in a quarrel\u201d. Three months later, the Board \ndenounced him to the local police for \u201cpublicly offering his medical serv ices, arguing he [was] a \nhomeopathic physician, without being examined, approved or authorized by the government for such a \npractice.\u201d The Board rescheduled a new examination for Sanchiz, but apparently he did not comply with \nit for the local government no tified him not to continue practicing medicine. See Correspondence from \nNarciso Sanchiz to the Governor of Mexico City, Jos\u00e9 Noriega, January 18, 1855.

AHSS, SP, \nEM, 3, 21, pp. 3.  \n12 In 1868, the SBH initiated the enforcement of the sanitary law particularly regarding the selling of \nmedicinal and poisonous substances. For this purpose it published a poster that ratified the Board\u2019s \nobligations amo ng which figured \u201c4a. To watch out that in the Department of Mexico only legally \nauthorized practitioners practice any of the medical sciences, and that in such a practice these 222 \n status of his degree was at stake, but under the liberalism of the Constitution  of 1857, it was \nrelatively easy for h omeopaths and certainly for Gonz\u00e1lez to obtain permission to practice in \nMexico City and in other parts of the country. For instance, Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019 homeopathic dispensary \ncontinued open throughout the Porfiriato and Gonz\u00e1lez continued offering his homeopathic \nservices .14 In 1875, Alfredo R. de Santillana, won a lawsuit against the government of \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \npractitioners fulfill their legal duties.\u201d In the same vein, the Penal Code is sued in 1871 ruled that those \nwho practiced \u201cmedicine, surgery, obstetrics, or pharmacy without a legal medical degree would be fined \nwith a year in prison and a fine from 100 to 1000 pesos.\u201d See \u201cAviso importante\u201d.

Agostoni explains that medical practitioners complained that such legislation was rarely set into \npractice.  See C\u00f3digo Penal del Distrito y Territorios Federales , libro tercero, t\u00edtulo quinto, cap\u00edtulo X, \nart\u00edculo 759; cited in Agostoni, \"M\u00e9dicos cient\u00edficos y m\u00e9dicos il\u00edcitos en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico durante el \nPorfiriato,\" 16.  \n13 While originally the government supported the regular status of his dispensary arguing that the SBH \nhad authorized it in 1868, Gonz\u00e1lez needed to find someone else to be in charge of his pharmacy in 1871. \nEnrique Chavari who had graduated from the ENM agreed to be in charge, and the SBH and the \ngovernment conceded the permission. When Chavari resigned after a few days of his new appointment, \nthe government allowed Gonz\u00e1lez to be in charge of his dispensary as his owner but not as a professional, \nnot making clear what this specifically mea nt. It is unclear whether the SBH required him to have a \nprofessional degree issued by the ENM, or of it specifically required him to have a degree of pharmacy. \nThe ad issued on May 26, 1868 was not clear if the person in charge of a dispensary or drug sto re needed \nto have either a medical or a pharmaceutical degree. Article 4 said that the SBH had to verify that only \n\u201clegally authorized professors practiced the medical sciences, and that they fulfill all responsibilities of its \nown facultad [profession]\u201d. Article 12 prevented that only pharmacists could engage in the commerce of \nmedicines. Article  49 said that whenever the commission visited a dispensary \u201cthe professor has to show \nits degree\u201d, without specifying if it needed to a degree in pharmacy or medic ine.

On one side he was included in the \nmedical registry of 1859 as a regular doctor a nd had a homeopathic dispensary since 1858. On the other, \nhis dispensary was apparently closed in 1871. While the government originally supported Bielsa\u2019s \ndispensary to remain open arguing that a decade -long provision of homeopathic medicine without any \ncomplaints from his patients attested that he \u201cdid not offend the rights of the society\u201d, and regardless of \nthe legal status of his medical degree, eventually the SBH closed his dispensary down. But due to the \nliberal constitution of 1857, it is unlikely tha t he remain passive after such an outcome, as the case of \nMedical Homeopathic Mexican Society suggests. See correspondence between Pascual Bielsa, the 223 \n Guanajuato who attempted to prohibit his homeopathic practice and his selling of \u201cspecialties\u201d .15 \nThis was a particular route exploited by practitioners who did not have a  legal degree throughout \nthe Porfiriato . In his critique, Eduardo Lavalle y Carbajal offered four examples to show how the \nSupreme Court of Justice valued individual liberties (article 3 and 4 of the Constitution  of 1857), \nwhich even threatened the life of  others, over the health of the population, when allowing \npractitioners to offer their services without a degree, sell dangerous medicines, validate their \ndegrees across the states, and overcome restrictions imposed by administrative authorities .16  \nThe req uest that Manuel Vald\u00e9s y Morelos, president of the Medical Homeopathic \nMexican Society [ Sociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1tico Mexicana ], made to the government of \nMexico City in 1878 deserves a special attention for two reasons. First, this society grouped \nhomeopat hic practitioners in 1875 and represented them since then, once homeopathic \nphysicians created their own. Second, the outcome of this request evidences the government\u2019s \nposition regarding the practice of healers who did not have professional medical traini ng in the \nNational School of Medicine .17 Vald\u00e9s y Morelos requested that all affiliates of the Society could \nissue death certificates. He argued that all members had a  diploma [a degree] issued by the \nSociety and that they paid income taxes as a result of t heir professional practice. But in an \nanalysis to this petition, E. Escudero, an officer of the local government, argued that while in \ngrammatical terms these homeopaths were profesores [professionals], in legal terms they were \nnot because they had not rec eived a degree from a legally established institution that certified \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nminister of Governance, the government of the Federal District and the Superior Sanitary Board, AHSS, \nSP, EM, 3, 53.  \n15 \"La homeopat\u00eda en M\u00e9xico,\" El faro homeop\u00e1tico   (1874).  \n16 See Lavalle y Carbajal, \"Historia de la medicina en M\u00e9xico. A los m\u00e9dicos debe exig\u00edrseles t\u00edtulo \noficial u oficialmente revalidado,\" 149 -55. \n17 See \"CR\u00d3NICA M\u00c9DICA. Acuerdo sobre una solicitud de la Sociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1tica \nMexicana.\"   224 \n they had the technical medical knowledge .18 If, he continued, death certificates were to be the \nlegal foundation of public administration in matters of just ice and health \u2014 through them a jury \ncould decide on the criminal nature or not of a particular death, or the sanitary administration \ncould decide which course to take in the outbreak of epidemic diseases  \u2014 they needed to be \nissued by legal experts. For this reason, he concluded, the state could not regard any person who \npracticed healing \u2014 let alone medicine \u2014 a legal expert, but those who had legal degrees. By \nnot fulfilling the legal requirements that the  state demanded for issuing death certificates, \nhomeopathic practitioners were marginalized from the state\u2019s bureaucratic apparatus.  \nPractice was a different matter. Escudero argued that by taxing homeopaths\u2019 activities, \nthe government acknowledged the pr ofitability of their private professional practice, but not their \nstatus as legal experts. In these sense, he interpreted articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution in this \nparticular case as homeopaths\u2019 right to heal and of particulars to seek their services. U nder such \ncriterion, the government officer clearly delimited the regulatory role of the state. It did not \nintervene in the private teaching and practice of medicine. Rather, acknowledging medical \npractice as a profitable activity, it demanded the correspo nding tax. For this reason the local \ngovernment allowed the liberal practice of homeopathy, whether in the privacy of interpersonal \nor epistolary patient -doctor interactions, or in the public advertising and exchanges taking place \nin homeopathic dispensari es, consulting rooms, and the printed media. What the state was not \nwilling to allow was that any unofficial institution intervened with state matters. In other words, \n                                                             \n18 The explanation was somewhat more complex. In Mexico City the Board of Instruction issued \nprofessional degrees once students had passed their own school\u2019s examinations. Both schools and the \nBoard of  Instruction were \u201clegal institutions that worked under legal authorization and consequently their \nacts were deemed official.\u201d The Sociedad M\u00e9dico -Homeop\u00e1tica Mexicana was not such an institution and \nconsequently its graduates, regardless of the nature of their doctrine, could not participate on official acts \nas professionals.  225 \n it would not allow that a degree issued by an organization established by a group of peo ple paved \nthe way to their involvement in official matters.  \nUnder the legal and political setting established after the Wars of Reform and during the \nPorfiriato , there was not space for legal or political dissent or resistance by irregular \npractitioners, p articularly homeopaths. On one side, regular homeopathic doctors had used their \nposition to push regulations in favor of and public spaces for homeopathic practice. Regulations \nin Veracruz, Puebla, and Mexico City (see chapter 2) had established the requir ements to obtain \na government -issued homeopathic medical degree. These regulations went together with the \ncreation of hospital wards in Puebla, and a hospital in Mexico City, and homeopathic schools in \nboth of the latter. With these regulations and institu tions, properly trained homeopathic \nphysicians with a legal medical degree could teach and practice medicine, including \nhomeopathy, in government institutions. Yet, neither were homeopathic hospitals and schools \nentirely integrated into larger government i nstitutions such as local sanitary boards or local \nministries of education ,19 nor were homeopathic physicians entirely accepted in the medical \ncommunity. In other words, state authorities pushed the creation of homeopathic institutions and \nthe formulation o f ad hoc laws that granted homeopathic physicians a place in regular \nprofessional life. But rather than integrating professional medical institutions, this effort \nperpetuated the division between homeopathic and allopathic institutions. By mainstreaming \nhomeopathy, the state promoted the division of the medical profession .20 On the other, articles 3 \nand 4 of the Constitution  of 1857 provided the legal venue through which practitioners who did \n                                                             \n19 Whether local sanitary boards in Puebla and Veracruz acknowledged such regulations in homeopathic \ntraining in the 19th century is an issue that demands further research. In the cas e of Mexico City, Porfirio \nD\u00edaz created the National School of Homeopathic Medicine, but it was controlled by the Ministry of the \nInterior, rather than the Ministry of Justice and Public Instruction.  \n20 For an extended argument of how ENM graduates and homeopathic medical doctors conceived \nthemselves as opposites see Carrillo, \"\u00bfIndivisibilidad o bifuraci\u00f3n de la ciencia?: La institucionalizacion \nde la homeopat\u00eda en M\u00e9xico.\"  226 \n not have access to regular medical training and consequently could  not comply with regulations \nthat favored trained physicians could indeed practice medicine in private institutions or their \nhome. In other words, the liberal Constitution  of 1857 and the regulations of the Porfiriato  \nprovided a legal and economic space wh ere all sorts of medical practitioners, elite and lower -\nclass, traditional and modern, scientifically or domestically trained, urban and rural, could offer \ntheir services.  \nWhat I have just described as forms of resistance are just the roots of dissent, fo rms of \nactions taken by different actors according to their social status within the medical profession, \nmostly in Mexico City, during the second half of the 19th century. These were taken according to \nthe resources they had at hand. Comellas, Carb\u00f3, and l ater homeopaths such as those who \nfounded the National Homeopathic Hospital [HNH] and the ENMH were medical doctors by \ntraining and enjoyed the social, cultural, and economic position that such training gave them. \nTheir active acts of resistance resulted w hen they perceived that the larger community of \nphysicians, mostly ENM graduates, did not embrace them. Practitioners such as Gonz\u00e1lez, and \nthe members of the Medical Homeopathic Mexican Society did not have the privilege of \ninfluencing the high government  spheres to create legislations that favored them. Consequently, \nthey actively resisted by using the existing legislation that allowed their practice. During the \nPorfiriato , particularly with the ENMH and the HNH, acts of resistance were isolated, short -\ntermed, and geographically restricted. But with the Department of Public Health sanitizing the \nmedical profession during the 1920s and 30s this situation radically changed.  \n\u201cIn homeopaths\u2019 defense\u201d: ELHM graduates seek DSP\u2019s recognition  \nThe reorganization o f the Ministry of Public Education [SEP] and the Department of \nPublic Health [DSP] at the turn of the 1920s left the Free School of Homeopathy [ELHM] out of 227 \n any regulatory government institution that could have legalized its academic curriculum and \nmedical  degrees. As I analyzed in chapter 3, however positive G\u00f3mez\u2019s and Dosal\u2019s comments \nabout the school\u2019s pedagogic plan and facilities were and whatever promises Vasconcelos made \nto support the ELHM, this school\u2019s graduates were in a position similar to that  of homeopathic \npractitioners during the Porfiriato . Regardless of receiving a similar training to that of ENMH \ngraduates, the contemporary sanitary regulation did not acknowledge ELHM graduates as true \nmedical experts, as evidenced in the medical registry  during the 1920s. Consequently the DSP \nlimited or more accurately ruled out their participation in the basic public administration act \nwhere doctors could participate in, the issuing of death certificates. Just as homeopathic doctors \ndid during the Porfir iato, these graduates wanted to be part of the new government organization, \ncomplying with regulations of the Ministry of Public Education [SEP], the UNM, and the DSP. \nBut they considered that their training, the Constitution , and the legal status of their  school \nentitled them to be treated as the rest of medical doctors trained in state -sponsored medical \nschools. In a sense, this group of homeopathic doctors combined the sensibilities of both \nhomeopathic doctors and practitioners during the Porfiriato  regarding their marginalization by \nstate authorities.  \nThe enforcement of the sanitary code in 1920 revived the problem of marginalizing \nhomeopaths, particularly ELHM graduates, by not allowing them to issue death certificates. This \nmotivated their active mobi lization to request the DSP\u2019s acknowledgement of ELHM degrees as \nlegal. The reaction of ELHM graduates was not immediate. It took them two years after the DSP \nrequired physicians all over the nation to report their names, addresses, and titles, and issued the \nnew legislation about medical registration and advertising. On June 24, 1922, Querido Moheno, \nrepresenting Facundo Hidalgo and 50 graduates from this school, addressed the head of the DSP, 228 \n Gabriel Malda, complaining about the restrictive attitude of th e sanitary department .21 Moheno \nargued that the DSP\u2019s refusal to register ELHM medical degrees impacted on their practice. \nParticularly, civilian courts in the Federal District would not accept their death certificates. For \nthat reason, the homeopaths\u2019 lawy er demanded that the DSP acknowledged the legal status of \nELHM degrees. If this happened, then they could be included in the medical registry and official \ninstitutions would accept their services and certificates. The lawyer based his demands on the \nanalys is of articles 3, 4, and 73, paragraph XXVII, of the Constitution; resolutions of the \nSupreme Court of Justice [ Suprema Corte de Justicia  de la Naci\u00f3n, hereon SCJN] whose verdict \nhad allowed the practice of homeopaths and pharmacists a few years earlier; o pinions of \ngovernment authorities about the quality of education provided by the ELHM; and the possible \nrole that homeopaths could play in the provision of medical services in rural populations.    \nAccording to his analysis of the Constitution of 1917, art icles 3 and 4 allowed free \nsecular education and free professional practice, respectively. The paragraph XXVII of article 73 \nallowed the Federal Congress to open professional schools. This latter article no longer existed \nby 1922, due to a modification in the Constitution on June 30, 1919, but Moheno believed that \nsince Higinio G. P\u00e9rez created the ELHM when this paragraph was still ruling, the school \nremained legal. He argued that no other regulation could stand above the Federal Constitution, \n                                                             \n21 The homeopaths were Facundo  Hidalgo, David P\u00e9rez, Manuel D.

This interpretation \nof the Federal Constitution was supported by verdicts from the SCJN too; for instance, on \nAugust 28, 1920, Juan Olliver, Mariano Berm\u00fadez, and Juana C. Viuda de Oropeza , graduates \nfrom the Free Homeopathic School of Puebla, won a lawsuit against the governor of the state, \nwho \u201cbeing an allopathic physician put obstacles to the professional practice of these \nhomeopaths.\u201d22   \nIntellectual elites and government authorities also had an opinion against the regulation \nof professions and in favor of the ELHM, and Moheno cited them in his letter. For instance, \nAntonio Caso, dean of the UNM, and founder of the Ateneo de la Juventud , a group of \nintellectuals who promoted the diffusion of humanistic culture and fought against positivistic \neducation and politics in the 1910s, believed that there was no need for a regulation of \nprofessions. So did Ezequiel A. Ch\u00e1vez, founder of the Nationa l University in 1910, Guillermo \nParra, promoter of positivism in the late Porfiriato, and Manuel Puga y Acal, secretary of the \nNational University in 1922. They believed that titles where only a warrant of technical \nproficiency, but in no way represented a  right to practice certain profession. Donato Moreno\u2019s, \nGildardo G\u00f3mez\u2019s and Fortunato Dozal\u2019s opinions about facilities, faculty, and students at the \nELHM were above those they had of the ENMH, in the report they submitted to Jos\u00e9 \nVasconcelos in 1922 (see  chapter 3). Moreno believed that the free school had better chances to \nbecome a good medical school in the future, though it lacked infrastructure to provide a proper \nmedical education at that moment .23 Moreover, Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos, also a member of the Ateneo \n                                                             \n22 Moheno, \"En defensa de los home\u00f3patas. Alegato del lic. Querido Moheno ante la Suprema Corte de \nJusticia de la Uni\u00f3n,\" vol., 17.  \n23 Besides Donato Moheno\u2019s letter see the report to Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos dated on September 15, 1920, in \nG\u00f3mez and Dozal, \"Sr. Rector de la Universidad Nacional.\"  See also Donato Moreno\u2019s personal \ncorrespondence in Moreno, \"Mi opini\u00f3n sobre las escuelas homeop\u00e1ticas, libre y nacional, formada 230 \n de la Juventud , and Dean of the UNM in 1920, sent an official letter to the ELHM that year \ndeclaring that, though the university didn\u2019t have the right to validate degrees from free schools, it \nbelieved that ELHM\u2019s \u201cshould have\u201d at least the same status as the ones from the ENMH, \nbecause they had a similar academic curriculum.   \nQuerido Moheno believed that besides legal arguments and favorable opinions, there \nwere also practical reasons that made the medical practice of homeopaths ideal to solve the old \nproblem of the provision of appropriate medical services to the Mexican population. The lower \nclasses poor access to medical services or the poor quality of the latter was an issue that \npervaded during the Porfiriato  and that sanitary and educational autho rities tried to solve after \nthe civil war in a similar fashion as Porfirio Diaz\u2019s government did, namely by controlling \nprofessional education and establishing a medical registry. But Querido Moheno argued that \nthose measures did not solve the problem. For  instance, he argued that the official medical \nschool did not provide enough \u201callopaths\u201d to cope with the demand of those practitioners in poor \nurban neighborhoods or rural areas, and the ones who practiced medicine preferred to stay in \nurban centers than live a harsh domestic lifestyle with a poor professional future in the \ncountryside. Moreover, this attitude left the local healer, the pharmacists, or the quack an \nopportunity to fulfill the popular need for medicines and cures. On the contrary, the lawyer  \nargued that the ELHM relieved the state from the burden to provide medical education to the \npoor class, and graduates could  provide free medical services \u2014 as they already did \u2014 in the \ndispensaries and hospital that the ELHM sponsored. Moreover, he contin ued, homeopathy was a \ncheap medicine, since in case patients consulted a private homeopath, the prize of the medical \nconsultation included medicines.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nconmotivo de las visitas que a las referidas escuelas hicimos los se\u00f1ores ingeniero Dosal y doctor G\u00f3mez \ncon el subscripto.\"  231 \n Gabriel Malda\u2019s reply to homeopaths\u2019 demands was not immediate. He even took more \ntime than Moheno could stand. On August 1, five weeks after Moheno submitted his first letter, \nthe homeopaths\u2019 lawyer requested that Dr. Malda provide an answer to his demands. Malda \nreplied two weeks later that the commission integrated by Dr. Francisco Castillo N\u00e1jera, head of  \nthe Office of Medical Practice, and lawyer Antonio Ramos Pedrueza, legal advisor of the DSP, \nwas studying the case .24 Moheno personally talked to members of the commission, but with no \nresults. The commission spent two months before it could decide the bes t course of action, and \nonce it did, the department was relieved from any responsibility to reply to homeopaths\u2019 \ndemands. On October 17, the department\u2019s commission decided that the DSP could not make \nany official statement about the legality of degrees is sued by the ELHM because that was the \nSEP\u2019s responsibility .25 In the resolution, Castillo N\u00e1jera and Ramos Pedrueza argued that the \ndepartment did not want to disagree with the Constitution, but the department\u2019s duty was to \nenforce the Sanitary Code which i n its articles 242 and 244 clearly stated that only legal titles \ncould be registered.  \nWith the resolution in hand, Gabriel Malda addressed Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos on October 20, to \ninquire if the SEP academically supervised the ELHM, and whether its medical degr ees were \nlegal. If this was the case, the DSP also wanted to know since when. Gabriel Malda also \nrequested information about the legality of the degrees of the homeopaths Moheno represented. \nThe head of the DSP informed the homeopaths\u2019 lawyer about this ne w administrative process, \nbut Moheno was eager to have a resolution from the department and insisted on October 28 to \nhave an official statement from the sanitary department. Without the response from the SEP, \nMalda consulted the case with the DSP\u2019s counci l, which decided to officially reply that what \n                                                             \n24 Correspondence to Gabriel Malda, October 28, 1922, in Moheno, \"En defensa de los home\u00f3patas. \nAlegato de l lic. Querido Moheno ante la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Uni\u00f3n,\" vol., 30.  \n25 See \u201cDictamen\u201d in the A SSP, SP, EM, 4, 15,  p. 22. 232 \n homeopaths demanded was beyond DSP\u2019s attributions and consequently it could not state \nanything about the legality of homeopaths\u2019 degrees .26 Coincidently, the same day that Malda \nofficially replied to Moheno, An tonio Caso addressed the head of the DSP in response of his \ninquiry to the SEP, notifying that the National University did not validate titles issued by free \nschools .27  \nThe exchange of correspondence between Moheno, the DSP, and the SEP raises \nquestions ab out the motivations behind both Moheno\u2019s and Malda\u2019s actions. The legal and \nadministrative structure in the early -1920s government institutions seems pretty straightforward. \nThe SEP was responsible for all professional state -sponsored schools in Mexico Cit y, having the \nUNM as the office that administered them, and the DSP was responsible to carry out sanitary \nmeasures by enforcing the sanitary code. If this is the case, why did Donato Moheno address the \nDSP requesting an official statement about the legalit y of homeopaths\u2019 degrees when the SEP \nand more particularly the UNM were the offices responsible to validate degrees? Moreover, \nbeing presided by Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos, and Antonio Caso, intellectuals who participated in a \nmovement in the late 1900s and early 1 910s that promoted liberal education to the working class, \nthe SEP and the UN seemed a better option than the DSP to address the demand to validate \ndegrees issued by free schools. Regardless of not taking any official position about the education \nof homeop aths, DSP\u2019s officer of the department of medical practice believed that the lack of \ninfrastructure of the ELHM produced physicians who lacked the required technical preparation. \nHe considered that even if students passed theoretical exams, the lack of hosp itals to do clinical \npractices, cadaver s to study anatomy, and laboratories to learn histology, bacteriology, and \nphysiology, made the school unsuitable to properly prepare its students for professional \n                                                             \n26 Correspondence from the DSP to Querido Moheno of November 14, 1922, in A SSP, SP, EM, 4, 15, pp. \n29 and 34 . \n27 November 14, see correspondence in A SSP, SP, EM, 4, 15, p. 28 . 233 \n practice .28 If Querido Moheno already knew about the n egative attitudes of elite physicians \nagainst homeopaths, evidenced by his correspondence, there were no apparent reasons to address \nhis demand to the DSP, rather than the SEP.  \nThe actions taken by the DSP seem contradictory too, particularly if a clear demarcation \nof the secretary\u2019s attributions is assumed. If a pronunciation on the legality of homeopaths\u2019 \ndegrees was beyond DSP\u2019s responsibilities, why did it take four months to  resolve this, and to \nrequire the intervention of the SEP? Why did Castillo N\u00e1jera and Ramos Pedrueza take so long \nto dictate the course of action that sanitary authorities should follow in this case? Sanitary \nauthorities were cautious, since an immediate negative response might have been considered an \nauthoritarian act of elite physicians who wanted to put out of the game all their professional \ncompetitors. This caution might have increased because the opinions of Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos, \nAntonio Caso, and Ezequi el Ch\u00e1vez provided by Querido Moheno in his letter might have \nworried sanitary authorities. For, if these notorious intellectuals and government officers \nsponsored free schools, then the entire project to regulate the medical profession under the DSP\u2019s \ncriteria, leaving free schools outside of the medical registry, was threatened, at least in Mexico \nCity.  \nThe attitude of sanitary authorities motivated a series of responses from graduates, but \ntheir actions were anticipated by an exchange between Luis Rivas  Cruz, a doctor from \nTamaulipas, one of the northern states of Mexico, and President \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n. This \ncorrespondence exchange is unique because while showing that Rivas Cruz agreed upon the \nsanitary dictatorship \u2014 apparently he participated in the disc ussions that made public health a \ncentral concern in the Constitution  and the Department of Pub lic Health federal jurisdiction \u2014 it \n                                                             \n28 See Francisco Castillo N\u00e1jera\u2019s \u201cOpinion\u201d and the comission\u2019s \u201cDictamen\u201d of October 17, 1922, in the \nASSP, SP, EM, 4, 15, pp. 21 -22.  234 \n also evidenced how Rivas Cruz regarded DSP\u2019s attitudes against ELHM graduates as \nintransigent. Rivas Cruz complained about t he  \nbloody, intense campaign of the [DSP\u2026] against free schools, evidencing that the \nworst enemy of Mexican people was Mexican people. University and Boards \naccept doubtful foreign diplomas. Maybe to flatter foreign people, they furiously \nattack national i nstitutions, legal by the Constitution , and accepted [\u2026] Scornful \nofficial monopolistic sectarianism.29 \n  \nPresident Obreg\u00f3n replied that he had no knowledge of what was happening and turned Rivas \nCruz\u2019s telegram to Gabriel Malda .30 The latter went to back to  the President saying that the DSP \nwas only abstaining from registering ELHM\u2019s medical degrees and that a final resolution to \nMoheno\u2019s request was in due course .31 Rivas Cruz sent President Obregon a long letter \ndescribing the situation, which was no differ ent than what Moheno had demanded, particularly \nregarding article 73, fraction 27 . According to Rivas Cruz, doctors who graduated from free \nschools should have demanded their rights and sued civilian registries, instead of going to \n\u201cphysicians with a legal  degree\u201d to \u201cbeg\u201d for death certificates. Such an attitude, he continued, \ninflated the pride of the Superior Board of Health and when  \nthe enemies of the revolution [\u2026] entered the Board in 1920, chest up, and certain \nthat they could step on the law with i mpunity, and overwhelmed by the success of \nphysicians from free schools, especially those from the [ELHM\u2026], the Board \nagreed to shot a \u2018UKASE\u2019 with no preamble ,32 \n                                                             \n29 Telegraph from L.

The association had been created in 1919 by a large group of ENM graduates with the \naim to protect the interests of the profession. When Vasconc elos merged the ENMH to the UNM they \nagreed to work in favor of a homogenous medical curriculum in the whole nation. See \"Asociaci\u00f3n \nM\u00e9dica Mexicana.

Rivas Cruz believed that the DSP wou ld \nnever reply to Moheno\u2019s request because \u201cthe wise Department feels very comfortable, laughing \nof the Revolution and the law\u201d.33 He finalized by acknowledging that some states registered \ndegrees of free schools but that many others followed DSP\u2019s criterion. Perhaps for Rivas Cruz\u2019s \nsensibilities, graduates from free schools should have taken a more active form of resistance, one \nthat actually acknowledged their rights and fought for them, rather than a passive one, aimed to \ncomply with sanitary impositions.  \nELHM graduates\u2019 response to the DSP\u2019s rejection to acknowledge the legality of their \ndegrees was not as passive as Rivas Cruz presumed. It is true  that some of them wanted to \ncomply with government regulations and tried to validate their degree with the UNM. Just at the \nturn of 1923, a few months after the DSP replied to Moheno that it could not give any opinion \nabout the legalit y of ELHM degrees, brothers Aliber and Eliud Garc\u00eda Trevi\u00f1o requested to the \nNUM that their medical degrees were revalidated. They had studied at the National Highschool \n[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria ], the Free School of Homeopathy, New York University, a nd \nthe University of Chicago. Then Eliud had practiced at the Hahnemann Hospital in New York \nand the Hospital of Essex County in Newark, New Jersey .34 Following university\u2019s regulations, \nDean Antonio Caso endorsed their high -school and post -graduate certifi cates, but consulted with \nLuis Porragas, head of the ENMH at the time, about the revalidation of their medical degree. \nPorragas replied that in his opinion only the National Highschool\u2019s degree could be regarded as \nlegal; titles from foreign institutions c ould be taken into consideration, and only because the \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nM\u00e9dica Mexicana.

Rather he suggested that they took a \nprofessional examination as if they had requested to be incorporated to the homeopathic \nfaculty .36 Eventually, the ENMH examined and passed Aliber ,37 but Eliud did not go through all \nthe process. Having passed the examinations and according to the university\u2019s and the \nhomeopathic school\u2019s regulations, Aliber received a legal homeopathic medical degree  from the \nENMH. It is important to note that his case was successful not because he had a degree from the \nELHM, in fact this was not even considered in the process of validation, rather, because of his \nforeign medical degrees and his complying with ENMH\u2019s legal requirements.  \nThe unsuccessful case of Eliud highlights the limits of this venue. Aliber\u2019s process raised \nENMH\u2019s students concerns about the non observance of ENMH regulations .38 Apparently, after \nAliber\u2019s successful case, Eliud requested to resume th e process to revalidate his degree. But \nENMH students demanded his petition did not proceed. They argued that Eliud\u2019s request had the \n                                                             \n35 See reponse from Luis Porragas to UNAM\u2019s Dean in AHUNAM, CU, 13, 92, pp. 121 7. \n36 In the school\u2019s reformed regulation of 1916 such an examination required that if physicians who \nwanted to incorporate to the homeopathic faculty had studied at a foreign medical school and such school \nhad reciprocity agreements with the National Universit y, then these physicians needed to write a thesis on \na topic related to homeopathic doctrine, be subjected to an oral examination about Materia medica, \nhomeopathic therapeutics, or homeopathic doctrine, and finally diagnose, offer a prognosis, and suggest a \ntreatment to three patients, one surgical and two medical, from the National Homeopathic Hospital.

After six months Aliber requested to \ntake his general examination again, and the committee of the ENMH ag reed, examined him and passed \nhim. See the description of the process by the Society of Students from the Faculty of Homeopathic \nMedicine in A HUNAM, CU, 13, 92, pp. 1217 and 1219.  \n38 See their complaints to the Univesity\u2019s Dean in A HUNAM, CU, 13, 92, pp. 1218 \u2013 1219.  237 \n same irregularities as his brother\u2019s .39 The University\u2019s Council formed a committee which \ndecided that Aliber\u2019s professiona l exam was valid, but before the committee presented its \nresolution about Eliud\u2019s case, he desisted from taking the exam .40 He concluded in his letter that \nhe desisted from the process because on one side his degrees  \nwere worth enough to freely practice his  profession, widely accredited by his \nclientele who paid the prize they considered his services worth of; on the other it \nwas shameful to beg for an exam for accreditation  [examen a t\u00edtulo de \nsuficiencia ], as if it was a favor or a grace that many requeste d, bowing their \nheads. I wanted [to be examined] to prove to the Nation that the money spent on \nmy allowance [when I was] abroad was not worthless.41 \n \nIn other words, while attainable, this venue did not work on the ground. On one side, \nbecause ENMH\u2019s inter nal regulations required that accrediting examinations [ ex\u00e1menes a t\u00edtulo \nde suficiencia ] were comprehensive, meaning that the examinee undertook an exam per each of \nthe courses in the ENMH\u2019s academic curriculum. This might have resulted overwhelming for \nELHM graduates, who had already pursued a medical curriculum that ultimately was pretty \nsimilar to the one offered at the ENMH. On the other, because while ENMH authorities \nfacilitated the process in some instances, this motivated concerns within the ENMH\u2019s  students \ncommunity which demanded that those who wanted to have their degrees validates went through \nthe requirements that ENMH internal regulations demanded. Judging by the actions taken by \nmost of ELHM graduates, they were not willing to advertise their  services as practitioners \nwithout a legal medical degree. Finding no access to the medical registry, they turned to the \nactive forms of resistance suggested by Rivas Cruz\u2019s correspondence.  \n                                                             \n39 Namely that it did not comply with school\u2019s regulations, that he did not hold a legal professional \nmedical degree, and that Aliber and head of the ENMH had violated the decision of the examining \ncommittee to let him wait a year before taking the second examination.  \n40 For the committee to resolve this case see A HUNAM, CU, 14, 97, p. 1360.  \n41 For Eliud Garc\u00eda Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s letter see AHUNAM, CU, 13, 92, p. 1216.  238 \n Moheno\u2019s inconformity with the DSP\u2019s resolution of November 1922 led him to take the \ncase to the courts, where sanitary and legal authorities and homeopathic doctors expressed how \ndifferent their interpretation of the Constitution  was. Moheno sued the DSP in a local civilian \ncourt using similar arguments to the ones exp osed in his letter .42 The sanitary department argued \nthat the sanitary code only regulated the medical profession exclusively on the issuing of death \ncertificates and that there was no law that made either the ELHM or its degrees legal .43 The \njudge sided wit h the DSP, arguing that medical practice was reduced to the diagnosis of diseases \nand the ministering of the appropriate remedies, and that the issuing of death certificates was an \nexpert opinion and consequently regulated as such. Regarding the interpreta tion of article 73 of \nthe Constitution, the local civilian court believed that free schools needed to be created or \nauthorized directly by the Congress in order to be legal, an authorization that the ELHM lacked. \nFor these reasons this court concluded that  the sanitary department\u2019s response to Moheno was \nappropriate and legal. Moheno did not agree with the civilian court\u2019s verdict and demanded a \nrevision of the case to the SCJN, which overruled  the original verdict .44 For the Supreme Court, \nthe ELHM had been created before the Constitution was even dictated. Consequently, it was a \nlegal institution to which the article 73 of the Constitution did not apply. The corollary of the \nSupreme Court\u2019s argumentation was that the  sanitary code was against the Constitution when it \nregulated medical practice.  \n                                                             \n42 The trial was on April 5, 1923. The transcript of the resolution of the case is in Moheno, \"En defensa de \nlos home\u00f3patas. Alegato del lic. Querido Moheno ante la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Uni\u00f3n,\" vol., 43 \n- 65. \n43 The civil court required an opinion and recount of facts by the DSP. The DSP replied on December 8, \n1922, see A HSS, SP, EM, 4, 15, pp. 35-37. \n44 The document requesting the revision to the Supreme Court of Justice is dated on April 23, 1923. See \nQuerido Moheno\u2019s document that demands the revision of the lawsuit in A HSS, SP, EM, 4, 15, pp. 64-66. \nSee also \u201cMemorandum  relativo a la \u2018Escuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda\u2019 de M\u00e9xico\u201d, en Los m\u00e9dicos de la \nEscuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda y los art\u00edculos 3o. y 4o. constitucionales   14-15.  239 \n Sanitary authorities were determined to ban homeopaths from the medical registry. With \ncharacteristic legal and administrative audacity, the DSP dismissed the Supreme Court\u2019s legal \ninterpretation and acted strictly according to what homeopaths explicitly demanded. In their \ndemand to the SCJN, Moheno literally demanded that sanitary authorities officially stated, in \nagreement with the President, their position about the legality  of ELHM degrees. On June 25, \n1925, the DSP sent a letter to President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles summarizing the events during all \nthis legal process and the reasons behind sanitary authorities\u2019 actions . This letter concluded with \na suggestion of resolution to  the President, \u201cTell Mr. Facundo Hidalgo and its associates that, \nregarding their correspondence of June 24, 1922, it is not possible for the DSP to respond to their \npetition because it is beyond its responsibilities\u201d.45 By this time Plutarco El\u00edas Calles had already \nan opinion about free schools, since he had already legislated against their legality, so DSP\u2019s \nletter was only a formality and a legal requirement. The sanitary department did not register the \ntitles of graduates from the ELHM, as evidenced in  the medical registry .46 \nThe Limits of the \u201cSanitary Dictatorship\u201d: Contesting the Sanitary Legislation at the Ground \nLevel and Changing the Legislation from the Bottom Up  \nFinding the long, both legal and administrative, procedures of the bureaucratic appar atus \nineffective to their purposes, ELHM graduates sought other ways to establish a legal practice. \nThey took advantage of article 121 of the Constitution  which dictated that professional degrees \nissued by each state government must be accepted by any othe r one. This constitutional right \nopposed the aim of the DSP to centralize the control of the medical profession and of the SEP, \nparticularly the UNM, to regulate professional training at the national level. Some states used \n                                                             \n45 Correspondence from the head of the office of legal affairs of the DSP to the head of the DSP, J une 25, \n1925.

A HSS, SP, EM, 4, 15, pp. 77-\n80. \n46 There is no graduate of the Free School of Homeopathy registered in the Homeopathic Physician\u2019s \nTitles Registry before 1930.  240 \n this prerogative to mark their i ndependence from central regulations but others sided on a \nhomogenous regulatory framework and aligned with the federal government. Consequently, \nELHM graduates used these inconsistencies with relative success.  \nStates such as Hidalgo (1917)47 and Morelos ( 1925 \u20136)48 regarded medical degrees issued \nby private medical schools such as the ELHM  to be legal . In the case of Morelos, th e \ngovernment even issued official degrees to ELHM graduates. The timing and sequence of steps \ntook by the government of Morelos sugg ests an open reaction to DSPH attitude against the \nELHM and the UNM\u2019s attitude against free schools. The governor of Morelos issued a decree on \nOctober 20, 1925, just four months after the DSP finally resolved the case of ELHM graduates, \nsetting on the leg ality of degrees issued by this and the Free School of Law. A few months later, \non January 31, 1926, he authorized the issuing of state issued degrees to graduates from these \nschools. If the governor wanted graduates from free schools to become legal pract itioners in the \nwhole country, he could only do it through the second decree. It is unclear how effective this \naction was. The registry of homeopaths does not include any entry from a homeopath with a \ndegree issued by a state government, or by a free schoo l before 1930.  \nIn the state of Yucat\u00e1n this strategy did not work. Local sanitary authorities had always \nbeen concerned about homeopaths entering the regular practice of medicine, even if their degrees \nwere legal, but once the DSP enforced the control of the medical profession, local sanitary \nauthorities followed DSP\u2019s guidelines. In 1919, the ENMH requested the government of Yucat\u00e1n \nto accept the former\u2019s medical degrees, but the local Sanitary Board, making veiled critiques of \nthe homeopathic system, dec ided not to accept the degrees, based on the authority of the local \n                                                             \n47 The decree was published on November 15, 1919; see \u201cEn favor de la ense\u00f1anza\u201d, El Universal , April \n12, 1919.  \n48 See \u201cEl estado de Morelos reconoce a las escuelas libres y expide t\u00edtulos oficiales a los graduados en \nellas\u201d in Los m\u00e9dicos de la Escuela Libr e de Homeopat\u00eda y los art\u00edculos 3o. y 4o. constitucionales   16.  241 \n state to authorize and regulate medical practice. The Sanitary Board decided that ENMH \ngraduates had to pass an examination like graduates from other medical schools, an examination \nwhere the Board expected that homeopathic knowledge would not pass the standards of the \nexamining committee .49 Four years later, in 1923, Benjam\u00edn L\u00f3pez, graduate from the ELHM, \nrequested the registration of his degree in Yucat\u00e1n. This time the local Sanitary Boa rd asked the \nthe DSP if the latter accepted those titles  and received the notification that only titles from the \nNational University or from state governments could be registered .50 \nEven in the Federal District where the DSP ruled professional medical pract ice, ELHM \ngraduates found ways to overcome sanitary regulations, register their degrees, and have their \ncertificates accepted by local civilian courts. After the DSP re fused to acknowledge ELHM \ndegrees as legal in November 1922, they started to request loc al municipal governments in the \nFederal District to accept their death certificates. Sometimes these petitions included other \npractitioners who belonged to homeopathic medical societies but whose training background is \ndifficult to track. Municipal governm ents complied with or rejected homeopaths \u2019 petitions based \non other local administration decisions, opinions of high federal functionaries, legal arguments, \nor political relationships. In November, 1923, the municipality of Coyoac\u00e1n agreed to receive \nELHM graduates\u2019 death certificates because Mexico City\u2019s government had already done it and \nthe secretary of public education had declared that the studies at the ELHM were as good as \nthose of other medical schools .51 Using the same evidence, the lawyer of the m unicipality of \nGuadalupe Hidalgo denied the petition in June, 1924, on the basis that civil judges could only \n                                                             \n49 See David Sowell, \"Quacks and Doctors: The Construction of Biomedical Authority in Mexico,\" \nJuniata Voices  5 (2005): 22 -23. \n50 See correspondence between the Sanitary Board of Yucat\u00e1n and the DSP of May 24, 1923, and June 12, \n1923, in the A HSS, SP, EM, 4,  36. \n51 Correspondence from the Municipality of Coyoac\u00e1n to the Free School of Homeopathy of November \n13, 1923, in the A HELHM  242 \n accept official degrees and that regardless of the opinions of UNM\u2019s Dean about the ELHM, his \ndocument stated that the National University did not  certif y professional degrees from free \nschools .52 The following year, the municipality of San \u00c1ngel registered degrees of homeopaths \nwho belonged to the Union of Homeopathic Physicians Graduated from Free Schools and \nordered local civilian courts to accept these homeopaths\u2019 dea th certificates on the basis of the \nrelationship between the homeopaths\u2019 union, the CROM, and the Assembly of Muni cipalities of \nthe Federal District .53  \nContesting the sanitary dictatorship was fragmented, leading to internal conflicts in the \ncommunity of homeopaths who graduated in free schools. This division decreased the effect of \ntheir political actions. For instan ce, most homeopaths who obtained authorization to issue death \ncertificates in the municipality of San \u00c1ngel were not in Moheno\u2019s original request to and later \nlawsuit against the DSP. While most of them were ELHM graduates, there were some who had \ngraduate d elsewhere (see chapter 6 for a discussion of other free schools offering medical \ntraining in Mexico City and Puebla in the 1920s) and who did not belong to the union. The latter \ncomplained with the municipality, submitting a list of actual affiliates who  should be the ones \nauthorized to issue death certificates. The lack of a corporate structure that unified demands from \nthe diverse array of graduates from different free schools and the DSP\u2019s monolithic criterion \nregarding degrees from free schools made c ontesting the sanitary dictatorship difficult. Rather, \nthe lack of coherent state policies regarding professional training at the federal, state, and local \nlevel, and regulation of medical training and practice made contesting the sanitary dictatorship \npartially effective.  \n                                                             \n52 Correspondence from the municipal governor to Guadalupe Arellano, J. Hern\u00e1ndez Osorio, and other \npetitioners, dated on, June 12, 1924, in the A HELHM .  \n53 For Tacubaya see AHCM, AGDF, T , M, 10, 40 . For San Angel see AHCM, M, SA, A, 3, 365 .  243 \n Also part of this effectiveness was the organization of corporate bodies that grouped a \nlarger contingent first of homeopaths who had graduated in free schools and eventually from a \nlarger community of homeopathy supporters (see chapter 6). Sanitary authorities\u2019 attitude against \nELHM graduates motivated a new form of organization amongst the latter, evidenced in the case \nof the municipality of San Angel. The union that obtained the support of the municipality of San \n\u00c1ngel had just been re cently created on July 10, 1924 .54 Yet homeopaths had been organizing \ninto unions since 1919, when they created the Union of Homeopathic Physicians of the Federal \nDistrict. This Union helped create the CROM in 1918 and continued as a member of this \nconfeder ation until 1928, when the confederation dissociated. But when exscinded members of \nthe CROM created the new Federation of Worker Unions of the Federal District in February \n1929, the homeopaths\u2019 union joined in .55 Homeopathic unions and their relationship w ith \nworker\u2019s organization in Mexico City eventually would lead them to push for the regulation that \nmade the ELHM a legal institution in 1929, but before this happened they continued pushing \nagainst the DSP\u2019s dictatorial measures.  \nThe Union of Homeopathic Physicians of the Federal District starkly opposed issuing the \nsanitary code in 1926. Facundo Hidalgo, the union\u2019s leader, addressed President Plutarco El\u00edas \nCalles on February 27, 1926, to request a meeting to discuss the new sani tary code, but the \npresident did not agree. Instead, he requested his particular secretary, Fernando Torreblanca, to \n                                                             \n54 See \u201cAmparo en contra del Presidente de la rep\u00fablica y jefe del DSP por parte del Sindicato de M\u00e9dicos \nHome\u00f3patas titulados en Escuelas Libres\u201d in AHSS, SP, SJ, 41, 10, pp. 3 -16.  \n55 For the unions that were part of the Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers during its  first years \nsee Davis, Urban Leviathan : Mexico City in the Twentieth Century   48.

Edmundo Torreblanca, who had graduated from the ENH in 1896, \nhad a talk with Fernando about Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez Osorio, the ELHM graduate who would \nrepresent homeopaths in this negotiation, before Fernando met with Jos\u00e9 on March 4 .57 Whether \nEdmundo supported Hern\u00e1ndez Osorio or not is uncertain, for while homeopaths shared the same \nmedical doctrine and were associated with the same professional societies, graduates from the \nENMH had doctrinarian and  institutional differences that set them apart from ELHM\u2019s \ngraduates. It is probable that homeopaths perceived that Edmundo\u2019s was a positive intervention, \nfor Facundo Hidalgo thanked the particular secretary for his \u201cattentions to and efficacy in this \nmatter\u201d.58 But President Calles already knew about the situation of graduates of the ELHM. It \nwas him who agreed with Bernardo Gastelum not to grant their titles legal status after they won \nthe lawsuit against the DSP in 1925. After discussing the ideas propose d by Jose Hern\u00e1ndez \nOsorio with President Calles, Fernando Torreblanca sent a note to Facundo Hidalgo, saying that \nthe president recommended him to raise his demands directly to the head of the DSP .59 Despite \ntheir political connection, or probably because of it, homeopaths neither discussed the new \nsanitary code with sanitary authorities nor prevented the DSP from issuing it.  On June 23, after \nthe code was issued, Hidalgo addressed President Calles requesting him to prevent the \nenforcement of the new sanit ary code. ELHM graduates explained that the new sanitary code had \nbeen elaborated by allopaths who had a year -long dispute with homeopaths and who were using \n                                                             \n56 Telegram from Facundo Hidalgo, secretary of the Union of Homeopathic Physicians, and President \nPlutarco Elias Calle s, February 1926.

But once again El\u00edas Calles turned the request to a \ndiffere nt office, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, to attend homeopaths\u2019 accusation against the \nDSP.60 \nThe turbulent years of 1928 and 1929 also impacted the mobilization of homeopaths\u2019 \nresistance. As I analyzed in chapter 4, President Calles reinstalled the ENMH  in March 1928. \nPerhaps as a result of this new support to homeopathy and UNM\u2019s mobilization to obtain its \nautonomy, ELHM graduates felt the opportunity had come to obtain the legalization of their \nschool. But the institutional leaders had not changed and their responses were identical to four \nyears earlier . Homeopaths used their relationship with the Federation of Worker Unions of the \nFederal District to address their labor problems with the UNM and the DSP in 1928. In the first \ndays of July, the federatio n spoke on behalf of homeopaths to the UNM. It requested the \nvalidation of ELHM\u2019s degrees if after an evaluation by educational authorities these degrees \nproved to warrant scientific proficiency. One month later, on August 27, 1928, the federation \naddresse d the DSP, requesting the cessation of \u201chostile acts\u201d and high fines carried out by \nsanitary authorities against homeopaths, at least while educational authorities responded if they \nwould validate ELHM degrees .61 But no matter what the political situation w as, the DSP\u2019s \nposition remained determined to prevent the registration of degrees from free schools. The legal \nconsultant of the sanitary department replied in the same terms as the department had answered \nhomeopaths\u2019 lawsuit in 1924. There was no hostilit y against homeopaths on the DSP\u2019s side, he \nsaid, the department only watched over people\u2019s safety by fining those practitioners who did not \n                                                             \n60 Telegram from Facundo Hidalgo to President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles, June 23, 1926.

For him, medical practice was not banned by the sanitary code \nor the sanitary dep artment .62 With no response from the university and with the sanitary \nauthorities\u2019 dictatorial position, homeopaths needed to wait until a new presidential term came in \nand the presidential cabinet changed.  \nIn 1929, when President Emilio Portes Gil stepped  in, homeopaths initiated a new series \nof petitions that had a key influence to include article 37 of UNAM\u2019s new Organic Law, the one \nthat gave the President and the SEP \u2014 but not UNAM \u2014 the authority to regulate free schools. \nThe exchange of correspondenc e initiated just one month after Portes Gil became President .63 On \nMarch 11, Gabriel S\u00faarez, an ELHM graduate and member of the recently created Mexican \nHomeopathic League [ Liga Homeop\u00e1tica Mexicana ], a professional society that grouped ELHM \ngraduates, noti fied the President about DSP\u2019s \u201chostilities\u201d against \u201c200 homeopaths\u201d .64 As he \nhad previously done, Portes Gil replied that they should meet with Ezequiel Padilla, the new \nMinister of the SEP, but this time he also notified ELHM graduates that he had instru cted \nAquilino Villanueva, the new DSP head, requesting, as former presidents never did before, that \n                                                             \n62 Correspondence from A.

On April 18, R. Trevi\u00f1o D\u00edaz, secretary of the Union of \nHomeopathic Physicians denounced DSP procedures and requested the president\u2019s intervention \nwith the DSP and the SEP\u2019s acknowledgment of the legality of ELHM medical degrees .70 A \nweek later, Alfredo Zendejas, a ELHM graduate, complained that he was \u201cdeprived from his \nprofessional rights just because he had studied at the [ELHM]\u201d and requested that the SEP \nrevalidate his degree \u201cthrough an accreditation exam [ ex\u00e1men de eficiencia ], just as foreign \nphysicians who came to [practice medicine to] the country did.\u201d71 A week later Manuel D. \nRodr\u00edguez, Fernando E. Alva, and Jos\u00e9 D. Z\u00e1rate, all ELHM graduates, made a specific request. \nIn representation of their \u201ccomrades\u201d, they requested tha t their degrees were registered with the \nDSP.72 In all these cases, Portes Gil resubmitted ELHM graduates\u2019 petitions to Ezequiel Padilla, \nwho turned the case to either the SEP\u2019s lawyer, as with the union, or to the UNM\u2019s Dean, as with \nZendejas, Rodr\u00edguez, A lva, and Z\u00e1rate . In the last petition, Portes Gil specifically required \nPadilla to \u201cdo a study about the case, procuring as possible to help the interested ones in avoiding \nthe difficulties they have been resisting to.\u201d73  \nELHM graduates\u2019 active resistance had a perfect political timing. While the UNM was \ngoing through the conflict with the central state\u2019s political control, homeopaths kept pushing the \npresident to participate in the institutional meetings that would decide their future as professional \n                                                             \n70 See telegram from R.

When the League received news that authorities from the DSP, the UNM and the latter\u2019s \nSchool of Medicine would celebrate a meeting in mid -May, Su\u00e1rez, Mazari, and Rodr\u00edguez del \nSolar requested to participate, as representatives of the ELHM, with \u201ctheir  opinion and their \nvote\u201d and both the President and the SEP\u2019s Minister agreed .74 Given the conflicts that the UNM \nwas going through during these months to obtain its autonomy from the federal government, it is \nunlikely that such meetings took place .75 Furthe rmore, after the federal government granted the \nautonomy to the NUM in the first days of June, Mazari, Su\u00e1rez, and Rodr\u00edguez del Solar \naddressed the Portes Gil to \u201cinclude in the upcoming University Law the needed dispositions to \nacknowledge the status of Free Schools and to revalidate their degrees by the National \nUniversity.\u201d76 They concluded their telegram acknowledging that they \u201ctrust[ed] [in the] right \ncriterion [of the] Prime Minister [in] accepting such petition [which] was indispensable [for the] \nlife of free schools and [the] preservation [of the] learned principle [of] free education included \nin [the] Constitution .\u201d77 As I analyzed in chapter 4, Portes Gil gave free schools an opportunity \nto be reg ulated independently from UNAM \u2014 though not from the  federal government \u2014 in the \nnew Organic Law of UNAM in 1929.  \nPortes Gil\u2019s government fulfilled ELHM graduates\u2019 petitions; not because authorities \nresponded explicitly to their demands. Indeed, no ELHM medical degree was included in the \nmedical registry d uring 1929, regardless of ELHM graduates complaints and in spite of President \n                                                             \n74 See telegram from Gabriel Su\u00e1rez, Manuel Mazari, and Rodr\u00edguez del Solar to President Portes Gil on \nMay 22, 1929; from Portes Gil to Su\u00e1rez, Mazari, and Rodr\u00edguez del Solar on May 23, 1929; from Portes \nGil to Ezequiel Padilla on May 23, 1929; from Ezequiel Padilla to Portes Gil on May 25, 1929, in \nAHELHM, Documents Obreg\u00f3n \u2013Calles.  \n75 Even Portes Gil was not certain that these meeting s would take place.

Portes Gil government \nused free schools, particularly the Free School of Homeopathy and the Free School of Law , as \nscapegoats that outweighed the political power that the university had in the Mexican society. \nYet perhaps Portes Gil wouldn\u2019t have used the Free School of Homeopathy had its graduates not \norganized into a professional group that raised their voices a gainst the marginalizing regulations \nof the UNM and the DSP. ELHM graduates\u2019 active resistance reached its objective in the late \n1920. The government issued ad hoc legislations that turned the ELHM into a legal institution \nand consequence, the DSP had no c hoice but to register its medical degrees. The majority of \nELHM medical degrees granted during the 1920s were registered as a consequence of this \nprocess. But just as with the sanitary dictatorship, the resistance of graduates from free schools \nhad also it s limits. As I will explore in the next chapter, sanitary authorities learned from the \nexperience with ELHM graduates and enforced their policies to avoid the registration of \ngraduates from other free schools of medicine in the early 1930s.  \nConclusions  \nWhat is the meaning of homeopathic resistance? In other words, what does this resistance \ntell us about the social organization of the Mexican medical profession in the 1920s? \nFurthermore, what does it reveal about the relationship between the Mexican state a nd the \nMexican medical profession? Homeopaths contested sanitary measures to control and regulate \nthe medical profession since their arrival to Mexico City in the mid -19th century. Yet while \nhomeopaths\u2019 efforts to resist authoritarian measures in the late 19th and early 20th century were \nsimilar in the sense that they confronted similar actors, i.e. sanitary authorities and faculty of the \nlocal School of Medicine, the polit ical situation of these institutions radically changed in the 20th \ncentury, leading to a completely new way to organize resistance.  251 \n During the 19th century, h omeopaths went from being foreign doctors who enjoyed the \nsupport of the ruling elite to both nat ional medical entrepreneurs and practitioners, who provided \ntherapeutic products and services, and national academic physicians, who were trained at state -\nsponsored medical schools, both allopathic and homeopathic. Such positions placed homeopaths \nat odds with both the local sanitary regulation and academic medical faculty. Consequently, their \nresistance was limited to find ways through which they complied with regulation and continue \ntheir practice. Even the increasing government intervention during the Porfiriato  gave \nhomeopaths a place, whether by giving them the  opportunity to be incorporated into the medical \nprofession through studying at the ENMH or by allowing their private practice to those who \nlacked professional studies. The only, yet meaningful, d ifference was that practitioners wouldn\u2019t \nbe authorized to participate of government life as professional experts.  \nAfter the revolution, the institutions that trained academic physicians and regulated their \nprofessional practice became central in the new government structures. New governments, \nparticularly in the second half of the 1910s, believed that it was necessary to create a coherent \nand unified government structure. This ideology permeated the medical profession and \nconsequently they used their posi tion within the ENM and the DSP to set the standards on what a \nprofessional medical practitioner should fulfill to be incorporated into the modern medical \ninstitutions of the new revolutionary Mexican state. But this ideology and the measures that \nresulted  from it aimed to impose from the top a unique view of what the medical profession \nshould be, a single medical school in Mexico City, a single medical curriculum, one single kind \nof medical degree, and one single type of medical practitioner in the medical  registry.  \nHomeopaths\u2019 resistance evidences the multiple layers of limitations of this unifying \nprocess in the 1920s. The different levels of government played a key role. If federal offices such 252 \n as the DSP and the SEP coordinated their efforts to perpetu ate the distinction between public and \nprivate institutions, preventing graduates from the latter from participating in any government \nactivity, local offices within the Federal District, such as civilian registries and local \nmunicipalities, not always ali gned with federal policies. Perhaps being aware of the lack of \nmedical practitioners in their particular jurisdictions and certainly as a consequence of union \nalliances, these local governments sometimes accepted death certificates issued by ELHM \ngraduates  or authorized their practice. This situation was extended at the federal level. As a \nconsequence of state government\u2019s autonomy granted by the Constitution  of 1917, each state was \nfree to regulate professional practice on its own. While some states used t he ideology that federal \ninstitutions were imposing in the Federal District, other, such as Hidalgo and Morelos, regulated \nin favor of ELHM graduates. These inconsistencies motivated the mobilization of DSP personnel \nand resources to the countryside in ord er to police medical practice (see chapter 4).  \nIn the Federal District, the UNM\u2019s silence regarding free schools in general and the \nELHM in particular contributed to complicate the conflict between ELHM graduates and DSP \nauthorities. Vasconcelos supported  the incorporation of the ENMH to the UNM in the early \n1920s, but while acknowledging the ELHM\u2019s pedagogic academic plan and facilities, he never \noffered any funding or legal regulation. Vasconcelos\u2019 acknowledgment to the ELHM mimicked \nthe contradictions b etween the Constitution  and the government structure. While the original \nConstitution  signed in 1917 authorized the foundation of free schools, the SEP and the UNM \nneither acknowledged their existence nor regulated their training during the 1920s. \nConseque ntly, ELHM degrees did not entitle their holders to participate in the government \nstructure. Homeopaths and other medical practitioners graduated from free medical schools were 253 \n marginalized from the institutions that the medical profession was building in conjunction with \nthe revolutionary state.  \nBut the relationship between the medical profession and the Mexican state suffered a \nrupture by the end of the 1920s. This rupture evidences the limits the political power of DSP\u2019s \nand UNM\u2019s authorities. The close  association of the medical profession to the state made the \nformer susceptible to the changing policies of the latter. When differences between them arose, \nMexican governments subsumed the project for unification of the medical profession in favor of \nits own political aims, which in terms of the medical profession meant a redistribution of \npolitical power. Homeopaths were there as a professional and political group that \ncounterweighted the political power of the UNM. It is not that ELHM graduates competed in \nterms of state resources with the rest of the medical profession. Homeopaths were marginal in \nterms of their population, of the number of patients they treated, and of the scale of their two \nmedical schools. Rather ELHM graduates were politically active , and their connections with \nunions, and leaders of the revolution such as Vasconcelos and Carrillo Puerto, motivated them to \nbe persistent in their demands to the federal government. Consequently, when it needed to \nbalance the increasing political power o f the university and its graduates, the federal government \nsupported ho meopaths, not because it sided with  their particular therapeutic approach, but \nbecause they represented a political group that actively supported free schools and contested the \nUNM\u2019s au thority.  \nHomeopaths\u2019 resistance was not effective against DSP\u2019s regulations. Homeopaths were \nnot able to convince sanitary authorities to stop either issuing reforms to the sanitary code in \n1926, which made controlling measures of medical practice even mo re rigorous, or enforcing \nsuch reforms, except from short periods of time. Rather, they convinced the federal government 254 \n and its minister of education to regularize the situation of their school. In other words, once the \ngovernment demolished the \u201cwall\u201d th at blocked the regulation of the ELHM, its graduates were \nable to escape from the DSP\u2019s \u201csword\u201d. But just for a brief period of time. As the data from the \nmedical registry evidence (see chapter 4), the DSP continued blocking the registry to ELHM \ngraduates during the 1930s and reforming sections of the sanitary code that aimed to forbid \nhomeopathic practices. As I will show in the next chapter graduates from free schools, including \nhomeopaths, continued resisting with limited success the sanitary dictatorshi p, evidencing that \njust as the sanitary dictatorship, their resistance had also its limits.   255 \n Chapter 6 . The Limits of Resistance: Medical Degrees, Medical Advertising, and the New \nSanitary Code, 1930 \u201334 \nIn 1935, the Union of Medical Docto rs of the Federal District [ Sindicato de M\u00e9dicos \nCirujanos del Distrito Federal ] published a special issue to criticize the political activity of \nhomeopaths and their institutions. In one of its internal pages, an image displayed in the \nbackground depicted a battle field where cannons and airplanes combated each other in an \nincarnate fight. An ambulance displaying the sign \u201csugar\u201d drove through the battle field to assist \nthose in need. In the first plane of the image, a high -rank officer handed a rif fle to a lower -rank \nsoldier. The sarcastic captions read \u201cIn the battle field. Injured soldiers must be treated with \nhomeopathic sugar; in the end canyons shoot nothing more than bonbons, sugar candies and \npeanuts.\u201d The picture was an ac erbic  critique to h omeopathic medicines. Regular doctors had \nmocked homeopathic globules for lacking any real therapeutic substance since the last quarter of \nthe 19th century, but in the context of 1935 this picture could be read as a metaphor of what was \noccurring in the pr ofessional body politic.1  \nGraduates from the Free School of Homeopathic Medicine had been struggling since the \nearly 1920s to have their medical school acknowledged as a regular institution. When they \nachieved such recognition in 1930, graduates from othe r free schools followed the path the \nELHM had created to obtain their official recognition. But sanitary authorities, who believed that \npeople trained at free schools lacked the appropriate medical training, reinforced their campaign \nto contain the prolife ration of what they called c harlatans with a medical degree . Sanitary \nauthorities did not introduce any new regulation; rather they enforced regulations on medical \npractice and medical advertising of the sanitary code of 1926. Their campaign was successful  \nand homeopaths could only seldom resist the DSP\u2019s sanitary dictatorship through 1934. In this \n                                                             \n1 \"N\u00famero especial dedicado a las manifestaciones charlatanesco -homeop\u00e1ticas,\" 10.  256 \n sense, the cartoon was a reflection of the effectiveness of sanitary policies to regulate medical \npractice in the first half of the 1930s. It is also a reflectio n of the useless efforts of homeopaths \nand other free -schools graduates to resist the DSP\u2019s dictatorial measures.  \nIn this chapter, I analyze the failed efforts of graduates from other free schools to resist \nthe marginalization of medical practice by the sanitary code of 1926. I argue in the first section \nthat the DSP enforced its sanitary police and turned into a regu lator of professional medical \ntraining as a result of the ELHM\u2019s political ability to obtain its recognition as an official medical \nschool. The shifting policies of the Maximato altogether with the conflicts between the state and \nthe university resulted in  new regulations that the SEP used to shy away from its responsibility to \nregulate free schools and the DSP used to ban graduates from the medical registry. In the \nabsence of an agreement between the SEP and the DSP regarding adequate medical training, the  \nlatter became and office that specifically surveyed free schools to pro ve they lacked official \ncredentials to grant medical degrees. In the second section, I explore how the DSP changed its \napproach to police medical advertising from trying to convince pr actitioners to comply with the \nsanitary code to generating legal procedures to have effective cases in court and enforce \npractitioners to both pay fines and obey the sanitary code. Finally, I analyze the arguments that \nhomeopaths used to try to convince Pr esident Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez and sanitary authorities to \nincorporate their demands in a new version o f the sanitary code in 1934. The se letters \nhighlighted the conflict between sanitary authorities and ENM graduates, or \u201callopaths\u201d, as they \ncalled them, a nd homeopaths in terms of class struggle, professional competition, and the \nsuitability of homeopathy as a scientific medicine for the working class. They used a social \ndemocratic rhetoric to convince the revolutionary government that supporting homeopathy  \naligned with the purposes and aims of the revolution. I conclude by reflecting on the enforcement 257 \n of the sanitary dictatorship and the limits of resistance to change the sanitary policies in this \nperiod.  \nRegulating Professional Medical Training: The Depa rtment of Public Health Contains the \nProliferation of Free Medical Schools  \nTaking advantage of a new presidential succession \u2014 President Emilio Portes Gil left \noffice in February 1920 and  Pascual Ortiz Rubio stepped in \u2014 and the consequent \nrestructuration of ministries, several medical organizations addressed the new heads of the DSP \nand the SEP to stop the registry of homeopaths in 1930. The National Academy of Medicine, the \nMexican Medical Association, the Federation of Medical Unions of Mexico, and the U nion of \nMedical Doctors of the Federal District asked President Ortiz Rubio to reconsider the decree \nissued by the former president and that had turned the ELHM into a legal medical school in late \nJanuary 1930. Using the public good as basis for their argu ments, these professional societies \nand groups demanded that authorities did not implement the decree, or at least that the SEP \ninterrupted the validation of ELHM\u2019s titles while the president and educational authorities \nconsidered what these medical organi zations demanded .2 President Portes Gil corresponded with \nthe SEP and the DSP and finally agreed to the request of these professional organizations, asking \nthe SEP to stop validating titles until the DSP gave its opinion about the situation .3  These \n                                                             \n2 Correspondence from the National Academy of Medicine, Mexican Medical Association, Federation of \nUnions, and Union of the Federal District, to the head of the DSP, Rafael Silva, February 26, 1930 , \nAHSS, SP, SJ, 7, 2.  \n3 On February 27, 1930, the President requested the head of the SEP a report about the academic curricula \nto the ministry of public education. On March 3, 1930, the latter replied that it was necessary to have an \naccurate preparatory education before entering the medical school, and since the decree that authorized \nthe FSH did not describe accurately the requisites to enroll in the medical school, the SEP could not \nvalidate its titles issued before 1930. He also suggested that the decree was modified so it included the \nneed to have preparatory studies before enrolling to the FSH. On March 14, 1930, President Ortiz Rubio \naddressed Rafael Silva, head of the DSP, to ask him for counseling to improve the decree that authorized \nthe FSH; AHSS, SP, SJ, 7, 2. See also \u201cACUERDO del Presidente\u201d in AHSS, S P, SJ, 28, 3, and \u201cAsuntos \nque se llevan al acuerdo del C. Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica el d\u00eda de febrero de 1930\u201d, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 7, \n2. 258 \n negoti ations show that the SEP was more interested in regulating requisites to enroll in \nprofessional education than the quality of professional medical training, the latter being the \ninterest of sanitary authorities. Furthermore, while both ministers agreed on the ELHM\u2019s \ndeficient academic curriculum and in consequence intended to modify the decree, the DSP \nrecognized that the SEP should not stop validating ELHM degrees that it had already received \nbecause in the sanitary department\u2019s experience that would lead to lawsuits that homeopaths \ncould win, constituting a precedent that would impose limits on a later modification of the \noriginal decree. In the end, the DSP left all regulatory activity of medical education within free \nschools to the SEP .4 Despite the abrupt reduction in the registration rate of ELHM -issued \nmedical degrees a couple of months after President Portes Gil authorized it (see Chapter 4), and \ndespite the demands of the aforementioned medical organizations and sanitary authorities \nthemselves, which requested that the SEP stop validating these degrees, the SEP and the DSP \nfollowed what the decree dictated a couple of years after 1930, but not for much longer.  \nThe new legislation that provided venues to turn free schools into legal i nstitutions in \n1929 had a positive impact in free schools in Mexico City, particularly the ELHM and the Free \nSchool of Law, but the changing politics during the Maximato  made their legal status weak. The \nSEP recognized the ELHM as a legal medical school, v alidated its degrees, and the DSP \nregistered the latter in 1930. The ELHM\u2019s exemplary resistance against the DSP and struggle to \nbe acknowledged as a legal institution during the 1920s worked as a model that other graduates \nfrom free schools both in the ca pital and in other states followed, in order to achieve the \nregularization of their own schools. But with a new legislation in 1933 that banned the SEP\u2019s \nresponsibility to authorize free schools and validate their degrees, the SEP could not respond to \n                                                             \n4 See \u201cMEMORANDUM relativo a la reglamentaci\u00f3n de las escuelas libres\u201d and following documents in \nAHSS, SP, SJ, 7, 2.  259 \n free schools\u2019 demands in the Federal District, leaving them in the same legal status as they were \nbefore 1930. The case in other states was different. The SEP had no jurisdiction on the regulation \nof professional training beyond the Federal District and conseq uently the decree that made free \nschools legal had no impact in the regulation of free schools in other parts of the nation. Facing \nthe SEP\u2019s passive role in preventing the regularization of free medical schools and the growth of \nother free schools in the rest of the country, the DSP assumed the responsibility of policing \nmedical training and banned, with very rare exceptions, the registration of medical degrees from \nfree schools, both in the Federal District and other states, for the rest of the decade. Th ese actions \nmade the DSP the principal agent that regulated medical training in free schools after 1929, \nlimiting the resistance of doctors graduated from these schools during the 1930s.  \nThe case of the Free School of Obstetrics and Nursing in Mexico City [Escuela Libre de \nObstetricia y Enfermer\u00eda , ELOE]  offers a window to analyze how the regulatory control of \nmedical training in free schools actually took place on the ground, shifting from the SEP, which \nwas legally entitled to exert such control, to the D SP, whose role was centered on preventing \nuntrained physicians from entering the medical registry. This case also evidences the way the \nSEP and the DSP interpreted the legislation to simply evade the responsibility to regulate free \nschools in the former ca se, and ban free schools from the medical registry in the latter case. The \nELOE regularized its situation as a free medical school on March 10, 1931 ,5 just one year after \nthe ELHM did. As a regular medical school, the DSP registered its degrees. But on Mar ch 8, \n1932, a new decree abolished the one of 1929 and the SEP attempted to withdraw the school\u2019s \nlegal recognition. In 1934, Arturo Palmero, head of the school, won a lawsuit initiated in 1933 \n                                                             \n5 See \"DECRETO por el cual se concede a la Escuela Libre de Obstetricia y Enfermer\u00eda de M\u00e9xico, el \nreconocimiento y los privilegios a que se refiere la Ley Reglamentaria de Escuelas Libres,\" Diario Oficial  \n1931, Organo del Gobierno Constitucional de los Est ados Unidos Mexicanos, September 20, 2012, \n<http://www.dof.gob.mx/index.php?year=1931&month=3&day=24>.7 . 260 \n against the SEP that required the latter to fulfill its admini strative duties regarding the validation \nof ELOE\u2019s degrees. But using UNAM\u2019s new Organic Law of 1933, which abolished the \nregulation that originally had given authority to the President of Mexico and the SEP to regulate \nfree schools in 1929, the SEP appeal ed the resolution to the SCJN in Arturo Palmero\u2019s case, \narguing that it no longer had the responsibility to validate the academic curricula and degrees of \nthe ELOE. In the appeal\u2019s resolution, the court acknowledged that the SEP had no longer the \nauthoriza tion to validate degrees from free schools, but recognized the right to issue medical \ndegrees with the same status as those issued by official professional schools, a right that the \nELOE had obtained in 1931. Furthermore, the court acknowledged the need to  create a new \noffice that registered degrees issued by free schools .6 \nThe DSP denied the registry to ELOE\u2019s degrees using arguments similar to the ones the \nSEP had elaborated in the lawsuit, apparently learning from the latter the legal basis to prevent \nthe inclusion of free schools\u2019 graduates in the registry. Sanitary authorities argued that UNM\u2019s \nOrganic Law of 1929 had abolished fraction V of article 157 of the Sanitary Code, the one that \nruled under which conditions the DSP could register degrees from f ree schools. If the new \nOrganic Law of 1933 abolished the one of 1929, the sanitary administration had no legal \nreference that characterized under which circumstances the DSP was authorized to register \ndegrees from free schools. In ELOE\u2019s case, the DSP ori ginally continued to register its degrees, \neven after the decree of 1932. But after the ELOE\u2019s conflict with the SEP, the DSP stopped \nregistering the school\u2019s degrees. On 1934, the DSP denied the registry to Mar\u00eda Salazar de \n                                                             \n6 Lawsuit Arturo Palmero, director of the FSON vs. the DSP, July 20, 1934, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 41, 8, pp. \n2-4.

He argued that the decree of March 10, 1931, \nturned the school into an official institution, and consequently it had to be considered as such \nwhen the  sanitary authorities  interpreted the Sanitary Code \u2014 fraction II of article 157 \nrecognized the legality of schools authorized by the federal government. But Palmero lost the \ncase in the court .7 The DSP argued that it could register free schools\u2019 medical d egrees that were \nexplicitly validated by the SEP from 1930 to 1933, but after the UNAM\u2019s Organic Law of 1933, \nthe SEP had lost its legal attributions and was no longer authorized to validate such degrees, as \nneither was the DSP to register them. Based on s uch arguments, the DSP continued neglecting \nthe registry of ELOE\u2019s titles throughout the 1930s. For instance, in 1937, Arturo Palmero \nrequested the head of the DSP that ELOE\u2019s degrees were included in the registry .8  \nFacing the lack of a clear regulatory f ramework for free medical schools and the shifting \nrole of the SEP in enforcing the regulation of these schools in the early 1930s, the DSP carried \nout profound investigations to find out if free schools\u2019 degrees were granted as a result of proper \nmedical training and not just to provide them a way of living. The DSP also pursued \ninvestigations to find out the legal status of particular free schools and hence the legality of their \ndegrees. In this way, the sanitary department rather than the SEP became the government \n                                                             \n7 The long case is described in the correspondence exchange between judges, the ministry of public \nhealth,  legal counselors of the DSP, and in the lawsuits and revisions to it by the SCJN, see AHSS, SP, \nSJ, 41, 8, pp. 5 -6, 8-9, 14 -17, 21, 23 -31, 32 -37, and 50 -56. A case w here the DSP used similar arguments \nwas the one of Isaac D\u00edaz Espinosa, a graduate of the Free Homeopathic Institute of Mexico. Ha had \ngraduated from this institution in 1920 and sued the DSP on 1934. He lost the case, because the SCJN \nargued that the DSP was acting constitutionally since it only did what the law entitled to do; in AHSS, SP, \nSJ, 41, 21.  \n8 A closer study of the registry needs to be carried out to figure out if Palmero\u2019s complaint was a political \npositioning regarding his ideas about the legality of free medical schools in general and the DSP \nobligation to acknowledge them as such or if the DSP actually denied the registry to ELOE students who \ngraduated between years 1931 and 1933 \u2013those years when according to the department\u2019s arguments \nELOE\u2019s graduates were regular.

The following are  \nsome examples.  \nIn Mexico City, the Institute of Medical Sciences had been educating physician -surgeons, \nsurgeon -dentists, pharmacists and midwives sinc e 1922. In 1931 under a new name, the then \nFree Mexican University [ Universidad Libre Mexicana, hereon ULM] tried to achieve the \npresidential authorization to become an official professional school. Foreseeing a SEP\u2019s new \nauthorization to a free school wit h dubious level of medical training, the DSP communicated a \nseries of cases that aimed to demonstrate the careless way in which the school granted degrees to \nits medical students. According to the report, Antonio Ruiz G\u00f3mez had learned medicine by \nhimself and after paying 500 pesos for a single exam, he obtained the degree of physician -\nsurgeon. Fernando Albisu Calvo validated subjects that he had studied in Zaragoza, Spain and \ncoursed seven classes in the ULM after which he obtained his title. The sanitary department \nreported similar cases in this school for surgeon -dentists. It also reported that it possessed \nevidence that the school never requested students any proof of having attended high school \nbefore enrolling in the university or issuing a degree. Wit h this evidence in hand, the DSP asked \nthe SEP to form a commission to evaluate the feasibility to deny authorization to this school .9 \nThe DSP ma nifested its intentions and neither the SEP authorized or validated its degrees of \nmedical doctor, dentist, pha rmacist, or midwife, nor did the DSP register these degrees in the \nfirst half of the 1930s .10  \n                                                             \n9 Correspondence from the DSP to the minister of public education, May 19, 1931, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 28, \n3. \n10 Correspondence from a commission of the ULM integrated by Dr. Antonio Ruiz G\u00f3mez, Dr. Migule \nOlgu\u00edn S., Dr. Jes\u00fas  Corral Gallegos, Dr. Rafael Renegal, and Dr. Rafael Palacios O., to President \nGeneral L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, September 24, 1935, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 29, 14.  263 \n The case of the Free School of Medicine of Puebla [ Escuela Libre de Medicina de \nPuebla , hereon ELMP]11 of Free School of Homeopathy of Puebla is an example of how the \nDSP carried out extensive and detailed investigations to find legal arguments to prevent the \nregularization of free medical schools not only in Mexico City, but in the rest of the country, in \nthe early 1930s. Sources are not consistent when referring t o the origin of this school, or even \nschools, to its (or their) actual name, and its (or their) particular doctrinarian orientation. Perhaps \nthis lack of consistency , the way sanitary authorities collected information about the school(s), or \na little bit o f both made it (them) appear somewhat obscure to the eyes o f sanitary authorities. It \nis most likely that the ELMP was a single school that granted a single degree of Doctor in \nhomeopathic medicine, surgery, and obstetrics .12 Just as the ELHM, the ELMP had a close \nconnection to the ENMH, since apparently one of the foreign homeopaths who revalidated his \ndegree with the ENMH helped to create this and other independent medical schools in the early \n1910s .13 President Venustiano Carranza authorized the ELMP on Ja nuary 4, 1915, four years \n                                                             \n11 Or Free School of Homeopathy of Puebla. Sources are not clear about the name of the school. Some \nlawsuit s indicate that the person who initiated the law suit was a homeopath who had graduated from the \nFree School of Medicine of Puebla, but other ones did not specified if they were homeopaths had also \ngraduated from this school. Verdicts from the SCJN also in dicate that they did not have clear evidence of \nthe identity of the school.  \n12 Most of the sources refer to it as the Free School of Medicine of Puebla, even lawsuits of its graduates \nagainst the DSP (see following references). Yet other sources that liste d those graduates who sued the \nDSP referred to the school as the Free School of Homeopathy of Puebla, as in \u201cLa Suprema Corte Niega \nel Amparo a los Home\u00f3patas\u201d, El Universal , 2 de junio de 1932, and La Opini\u00f3n , A\u00f1o VIII, tomo XV, \nPuebla, Domingo 29 de mayo  de 1932. Other sources mentioned the existence of both schools, as in the \ncorrespondence from Jos\u00e9 M. Mendoza to Deputy Alberto Bremauntz on January 23, 1934, in AHSS, SP, \nEM, 13, 12, p. 8 -11. Perhaps the confusion arose because this school offered degree s of \u201cPhysician or \nDoctor in Homeopathic Medicine, Surgery and Obstetrics\u201d, as Rafael Ch\u00e1vez de Alba explained when he \nsued the DSP, AHSS, SP, SJ, 45, 17, p. 2 -3. In other words, it was a free school of medicine that offered \nhomeopathic degrees.  \n13 Teofilo  Ollivier y Ortiz, a homeopathic physician who had studied at the Instituto Homeop\u00e1tico de \nColombia and who had migrated to Mexico in the early 1900s, started to practice homeopathy in Mexico \nCity around 1904, when he established a Homeopathic Office in \u201cL a Merced\u201d neighborhood. One year \nlater, together with his brother Juan Ollivier, he opened a homeopathic medical school called the Electro -\nHomeopathic Institute. A decade later, Juan Ollivier headed the Free School of Medicine of Puebla. See a \nnotarized co py of the decree issued by Venustiano Carranza on January 4, 1915, that acknowledged and 264 \n after it opened. According to his decree, the school had its \u201ceducational programs [aligned] \naccording to the regulations of the University\u201d, and authorized its head at the time, Juan Ollivier, \nto \u201cissue professional degrees that [were] applicable throughout all the national territory.\u201d14 The \nschool had no apparent regulatory conflict during the 1920s, until the congress of the state of \nPuebla, following the DSP policies regarding medical practice, approved a law on July 25, 1930 \nto nullify ELMP -issued medical degrees . Other states, such as Estado de M\u00e9xico, supported the \n\u201crelentless campaign [of the Congress of Puebla] against the charlatans who had exploited the \nignorance of the clases menesterosas [working class], protecting thems elves under fake \nprofessional degrees\u201d ,15 yet only ELMP graduates, who believed in the legality of their school \nand consequently of their degrees, mounted an energetic resistance against their government and \nthe DSP.  \nSeveral ELMP graduates sued the DSP for  several reasons from 1929 to 1936, but only \ntwo of them won their cases and made it into the medical registry. In general, this outcome was a \nconsequence of several reasons; the specific demands that each ELMP graduate made to the \nDSP, the lack of a unifo rm criterion with which the SCJN solved each particular case ,16 the \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nofficially recognized the ELMP, in AGN, ALR, 011/13, see also corresponendence from Antonio P\u00e9rez \nAlcocer, head of the DSP Office of Legal Affairs to the Head of the D SP, on December 4, 1936, AHSS, \nSP, P, S, 14, 5.  \n14 See a notarized copy of the decree issued by Venustiano Carranza on January 4, 1915, that \nacknowledged and officially recognized the ELMP, in AGN, ALR, 011/13  \n15 Correspondence from Abelardo Monta\u00f1o and Eze quiel G.

But the SCJN did not find evidence that the DSP forbid his practice and offer a verdict \nthat favored the DSP .20 Juan Guerrero got a similar verdict, in this case because the DSP pu rsued \nan intensive search of a document where, according to Guerrero ,21 former President Venustiano \nCarranza authorized the ELMP. The DSP did not find such document and decided that because \nthe \u201cdepartment did not have the absolute certainty of the legality  of [Guerrero\u2019s] degree, [\u2026] \nthe registry of such document in the [sanitary] office did not proceed.\u201d22   \nThe successful case of Rafael Ch\u00e1vez de Alva highlights the limitation of resistance \nagainst the regulatory role of the DSP during the early 1930s. Ch\u00e1 vez de Alva lost his first \nlawsuit against the DSP in 1931. The sanitary department argued that Carranza\u2019s decree  \nwas not published in El Constitutcionalista , official journal of the Revolutionary \nGovernment; [that] no minister ratified the decree; [that]  the Ministry of War \ncould not find in its archives any proof that Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz Infante informed in a \ndocument issued in January 1915 President Carranza\u2019s desires to officially \nrecognize the school; [that] public notary Callejo did not certify that Mu\u00f1oz was  \nthe one who signed the document that informed about the school [offi cial] \nrecognition ;23  \n \n                                                             \n19 These graduates were Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez del Solar, Librado Toquiantzi, Sebasti\u00e1n Bucio, and \nVicente D. Anaya. The exact verdict of the SCJN is not stated in the source. Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez del \nSolar was a graduate from the ELHM who obt ained the registry in 1930 as a consequence of the degree \nthat regularized the ELHM and not as a consequence of a lawsuit. It is unlikely that the final result of the \nlegal processes of the other graduates benefited, since they were not registered by the D SP. \n20 See correspondence from Manuel Gea Gonz\u00e1lez, head of the DSP, to the Judge of the 6th District of the \nFederal District on November 17, 1933; and Veredict to the SCJM of November 18, 1933, in AHSS, SP, \nSJ, 38, 12, pp.  \n21 Several ELMP graduates pointed out to sanitary authorities the existence of this document. Both \nAntonio Herrera Bravo and Juan Guerrero indicated that such document was issued on January 4, 1915. \nAs I pointed out in a previous note, this statement was accurate. Other graduates, such as Dr. Jos\u00e9 de \nJes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Galindo said that the document was issued on Dec 20, 1914, see AGN, POR, 1932 \n24/1959.  \n22 See certificate of Manuel Gea Gonz\u00e1lez on November 27, 1934, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 41, 12, pp. 8 -9.  \n23 Lawsuit of Rafael Ch\u00e1vez de Alba against the DSP on July 8, 1935, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 45, 17, pp. 2 -3.  267 \n and others that highlighted Carranza\u2019s limited attributions to regulate education beyond the \nFederal District and the inconsistencies in the public administration th at gave the DSP authority \nover judicial decisions on administrative matters .24 Like Herrera Bravo\u2019s case, Ch\u00e1vez de Alba \nused former verdicts that favored ELMP graduates and the same constitutional articles that the \nDSP violated in the revision of his case.  But in contrast to Herrera Bravo\u2019s case, Ch\u00e1vez de Alba \nspecifically demanded the DSP decision to deny him the registry, arguing that degrees issued by \nthe ELMP were as legal as those issued by other states (article 121 of the Constitution ). In this \ncase the SCJN\u2019s verdict benefited Ch\u00e1vez de Alba, not because his argument was better \nformulated in legal terms than Herrera Bravo\u2019s, but because the DSP used the sanitary code of \n1926 instead of the current one (1934) to deny Ch\u00e1vez de Alba de registry .25 A fai lure in the \nDSP\u2019s legal procedure helped Rafael Ch\u00e1vez de Alba to make it into the medical registry. In the \n1930s, the DSP only registered ELMP degrees that the SCJN explicitly obliged it to register; in \nthis case, only two, the degrees of Rafael Ch\u00e1vez de  Alba and Rafael M\u00e1rquez.  \nELMP graduates could not get the DSP to acknowledge the legality of their school and \nconsequently register their degrees during the first half of the 1930s, unless a verdict from the \nSCJN explicitly requested the government offic e to do it. Consequently, they followed the same \nvenue that their professional peers from the ELHM had pursued in the late 1920s, mainly the \nmobilization of its graduates to directly demand President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s intervention. \nIn contrast to the  case of the ELHM, in 1932 there already was a decree that regulated the \nlegalization of free professional schools and this decree required that free medical schools had \nthe same academic curriculum as the ENM, among other requirements such as hygienic and  \n                                                             \n24 Besides the lawsuit see also correspondence from Antonio P\u00e9rez Alcocer to the head of the DSP on \nDecember 4, 1936, in AHSS, SP, P, S, 14, 5.  \n25 See revision of the lawsuit of Rafael Ch\u00e1vez Alva a gainst the DSP on November 14, 1935, in AHSS, \nSP, SJ, 45, 17, pp. 17 -8.  268 \n adequate facilities and a record of middle and high -school studies. Perhaps these requirements \nprevented the ELMP from undertaking this venue to legalize the situation of its graduates. Yet if \nit had gone through it, there might have been other arguments,  such as the ones ELHM graduates \nfaced, where medical degrees issued since the creation of the school until its legalization would \nhave been still considered irregular by DSP authorities.  \nELMP graduates, particularly those living in Durango, a state in no rthern Mexico, and \naffiliated to the Society of Homeopathic Physicians from Durango [ Sociedad de M\u00e9dicos \nHome\u00f3patas Durangue\u00f1os ]26 wanted to overcome this regulatory inconsistency by addressing \nthe President.

The \nsociety complained that the DSP\u2019s sanitary agents only wanted that \u201callopaths enjoyed the \nwarrants given in the Constitution \u201d and that the state government of Puebla did not acknowled ge \n                                                             \n26 In the first half of the 1930s, this society was formed by Dr. Miguel A.

Rodr\u00edguez promised to turn \nthe case to his minister of the interior, former president Emilio Porte Gil, and even if homeopaths had \nalliances with Masonic groups to which President Rodr\u00edguez belonged and pay allegiance to, he \neventually sent the case to the DSP. See letter from the Society of Homeopathic Physicians  from Durango 270 \n term, President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez asked the DSP to find a solution to ELMP graduates \ncomplaints.  \n In 1936, Antonio P\u00e9rez Alcocer, head of the DSP Office of Legal Affairs acknowledged \nthat despite the higher proporti on of verdicts of the SCJN in favor of ELMP graduates vs. those \nin favor of the sanitary department,  \nthe [DSP] continued denying the registry of degrees [of ELMP graduates who \nwon their lawsuit], particularly since the school and the lawsuits in the court  \nnegotiated an uncountable quantity of degrees that the school issued even while \nbeing closed, but making them appear as if they had been issued before the \nclosure.34  \n \nP\u00e9rez Alcocer\u2019s statement could not express in a more open and clearer way the role that  the \nDSP played as the regulator of medical training in Mexico in the early 1930s and how this role \nlimited the possibilities of resistance of graduates from free schools. Under the rule of a Ministry \nof Public Education whose original policy opened the ga tes to the regularization of medical \ntraining in free schools, the DSP became stricter in the application of the sanitary code in matters \nof professional practice. But during the changing policies and regulations of the Maximato , the \nSEP soon stop ped sidin g with free schools and even provided with the legal foundations to \nprevent their medical degrees from being registered with the DSP. While this worked in some \ninstances, the legal arguments that the DSP used where useless in cases such as the ELMP\u2019s, \nwher e the legality of the school was more likely and the majority of SCJN\u2019s verdicts sided the \nELMP rather than the DSP. Yet the DSP\u2019s political and institutional power was imposed over \nother foundational state institutions such as the SCJN, showing that right  of a healthy society \u2014\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nto President Abelardo L.

As I analyzed in chapt er 4, the \nnew Sanitary Code of 1926 provided the regulatory framework with which the DSP initiated a \nnational campaign to control medical practice. Aware of the limitations that the lack of a \nregulation of article 4 of the Constitution imposed, the sanitar y police in Mexico City and \nsanitary delegates in the rest of the nation loosely implemented this campaign, seldom imposing \nthe fines that the sanitary code imposed during the remaining years of the 1920s . 35 Sanitary \ndelegates had been playing this role si nce the late 1920s. They supervised specific \nneighborhoods, collecting the names printed on the ads of medical consulting offices that \npopulated the urban landscape. They then contrasted the collected names of medical practitioners \nto those included in the  medical registry. Whenever they found a mismatch, they summoned the \noffender, notified him/her about the sanitary regulations that forbade the way (s)he advertised \nmedical services, and let the offender go. ELHM graduates regarded these actions as \u201chostil e \n                                                             \n35 There were certainly fines. According to the annual report from the DSP Office of Demography and the \nPractice of Medicine of 1926 in December there had only been one single fine of $100 pesos to someone \nwho advertised m edical services without having his degree registered with the DSP. If we trust this \ninformation, the annual report of 1926 accounts for 4 practitioners fi ned in 1926. The annual report of \n1929 informed that those practitioners who did not register their de grees \u201cwere summoned by this office \n[of Demography and the Practice of Medicine] to visit the lawyer of the office, who tried to convince \nthem to fulfill the requirements [of the sanitary code which were] applicable to them.

Those practitioners who were suspicious of illegal practice were \nsummoned in to the local sanitary office or municipal government office to declare if s/he \npracticed medicine with a title or not. The sanitary delegate\u2019s report needed to quote the way the \npractitioner advertised his/her services and the way s/he presented her/himself to potential \ncustomers. If there was physical evidence of the practit ioner\u2019s publicity, the latter needed to \naccept that s/he personally requested that specific publicity .37 This specific form of procedure \nobeyed legal reasoning. If a practitioner explicitly assumed his/her authorship in the medical \nadvertisement in question, (s)he would immediately be held responsible for violating the \nSanitary Code. But legal clarity did no t preclude suing from those aggravated learned \npractitioners who knew that medical practice was free in Mexico and that sanitary authorities\u2019 \nintervention was a form of restriction to their practice. The reaction of most practitioners who \ngraduated from fr ee medical schools was particularly intense after the authorization of these \n                                                             \n36 Correspondence from A.

Lawsuits against the DSP for fining practitioners who \nimproperly advertised their services appear in the DSP archives starting from this period.  \nThe following cases exemplify how sanitary authorities carried out this policy in Mexico \nCity. Antonio Herrera Bravo had graduated from the ELMP. In the early 1930s he offered his \nservices with the following advertisement:  \nMedical and Surgical Consulting  Office of Dr. Antonio Herrera Bravo, with \nofficially recognized title. Former director of the General Hospital of \nChilpancingo, Guerrero. Sanitary delegate and former director of the Civil \nHospital of Texcoco, M\u00e9xico. Sanitary delegate and former head of the sanitary \nsections at the Army. Collaborator of the gazette \u201cMedicina\u201d edited in the \nNational School of Medicine of Mexico. Specialty in treating women and children \ndiseases. Medical electricity.38 \n \nOn November 8, 1933, the DSP\u2019s office of legal affairs summoned him to testify if this \nad referred to him. Herrera Bravo acknowledged that he was the person this ad referred to. \nConsequently the head of the DSP Office of Legal Affairs advised him to comply with articles \n155 (about the responsibility of all med ical practitioners to notify their change of address to the \nDSP) and 158 (about proper medical advertising) of the Sanitary Code. He replied that he had \ncomplied with everything that the article 155 stipulated and that he had registered his degree \nwith the  Medical Division of the Army and that he would register it with the DSP as soon as \npossible .39 But he did not. A week later, Herrera Bravo sued President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles for \nissuing the Sanitary Code of 1926, and the DSP, for asking him to exclude in formation about his \nmedical degree in his prescriptions and consulting office ad, actions he believed were \nunconstitutional because they obstructed his free medical practice .40 He did not win the case, \nneither at a local court nor its appeal to the SCJN. Th e DSP showed evidence of the meeting that \n                                                             \n38 Certificate from the DSP Office of Legal Affairs to Manuel Gea Gonz\u00e1lez, Ministry of the DSP, in \nAHSS, SP, SJ, 38, 12, pp. 16.  \n39 Report from the DSP\u2019s office of legal affairs to the minister of the DSP with information about the case \nof Dr. Antonio Herrera B ravo.

AHSS, SP, SJ, 38, 12, pp. 3 -6. 274 \n the head of the Office of Legal Affairs had with Antonio Bravo, and the latter was not able to \ndemonstrate that sanitary authorities forbade his medical practice. Having established a formal \nprocedure to prosecute practitioners who illegally advertised their services gave sanitary \nauthorities the evidence they needed to start winning this type of cases at the court.  \nIn another case, sanitary authorities fined Juan F. Lecanda on October 6, 1933, for \npersistently adv ertise his medical services using the word \u201cdoctor\u201d, without having a degree \nregistered with the DSP .41 Lecanda requested a revision of his case, though he also paid the fine \nin case the DSP did not change his position. As he expected, the DSP did not withd raw its \ncharges and he sued the sanitary office. He requested the DSP withdraw from the fine, for its \naccusations of having advertised his services without an authorized medical degree, and for \nforbidding him to advertise his service as physician .42 Interes tingly, the court\u2019s verdict conceded \nhis first request but the court agreed with the DSP on the issue of medical advertising and \nmedical practice. The court explicitly required that the DSP did not consider the cash deposit as a \nfine, in other words, that that there were no material consequences for infringing the sanitary \ncode, arguing that the article 158 of the sanitary code regulated the medical profession and \nconsequently placed sanitary regulation over article 4 of the Constitution .43 Sanitary authorit ies \ndid not want that this idea established a precedent that further demands used against the DSP. \nRather they wanted to emphasize the idea that the sanitary code only regulated medical \nadvertising and not medical practice. For this reason they requested a  revision to the SCJN, even \n                                                             \n41 Sue from Juan F. Lecanda against the DSP, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 37, 16, p. 2.  \n42 Ths DSP agreed on the first two actions, but argued that they were applied  according to the law. It did \nnot agree with the last action. According to the DSP\u2019s report, the DSP never prohibited Lecanda to \nadvertise his services as doctor. See Report from Manuel Gea Gonz\u00e1lez to the judge of the 4th District, on \nDecember 12, 1933, i n AHSS, SP, SJ, 37, 16, p. 4.  \n43 Correspondence from judge 5th of District, Juan A. Coronado, to Manuel Gea Gonz\u00e1lez, DSP Ministry, \non April 10, 1934, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 37, 16, p. 9.  275 \n after the local court had denied that the DSP was restricting Juan Lecanda\u2019s medical practice .44 \nWith a decade -long experience of lawsuits from ELHM graduates and after realizing what their \npolitical mobilization could achieve, t he DSP was not willing to give graduates from free school \nany legal resource that helped them to get into the registry.  \nThis effort did work on the ground, as the case of Ernesto Guill\u00e9n Ur\u00eda, a graduate from \nthe Free Homeopathic Institute of Mexico [ Instituto Libre Homeop\u00e1tico de M\u00e9xico , ILHM]  who \nheld a degree of m\u00e9dico cirujano y partero [physician -surgeon and male midwife], exemplifies. \nHe advertised his services with the following ad:  \nERNESTO GUILLEN URIA  \nHomeopath  \nConsulting Hours 11 to 1, 5 to 8  \nInternal Medicine. Women and Children Diseases  \nHomeopathic Medical Consulting Office  \nE. Guill\u00e9n Ur\u00eda45 \n \nOn March 7 1935, Guill\u00e9n Ur\u00eda visited the DSP Office of Legal Affairs and \nacknowledged that he was the person whom the ad referred to. According to the repo rt of this \noffice, authorities notified him about the modifications of the new sanitary code of 1934. \nAuthorities did not proceed immediately even after acknowledging that the DSP had previously \nwarned Guill\u00e9n Ur\u00eda about the irregular way he displayed info rmation in his medical ads. \nAccording to the report the practitioner agreed to fulfill the requirements of the sanitary code and \nthe sanitary office gave him fifteen days to do it. But Guill\u00e9n Ur\u00eda sued the DSP and asked that \nthe latter withdraw from its r equirement to remove his ads and that gave adequate procedure to \nthe demand to revise his case .46 The lawsuit exposed the contradictions of the practitioner. He \nargued that the DSP had verbally requested him to remove his ads if he wanted to avoid the \n                                                             \n44 File with documents regarding Juan F.

Accordingly, he asked for a revision of his case, but the sanitary department \nreplied that he had violated articles 447 and 448 of the sanitary code. The DSP Office of Legal \nAffairs demonstrated that there was no threat, that the practitione r agreed to comply with the \nrequirements of the sanitary code, and that the DSP revised his case responding that it could not \nmake exceptions to the law .47 Moreover, it also showed evidence that the sanitary delegates had \nasked the practitioner to add the l egend \u201cwithout legally recognized degree\u201d to his ad rather than \nasking him to remove it, and that acknowledging the regulations in the s anitary code, he \nreiteratively \u2014 on July 7, 1934, and on March 7, 1935  \u2014 had previously made commitments to \nmodify his p ublicity. The substantial evidence favored the DSP and Ernesto Guill\u00e9n Ur\u00eda lost the \ncase,48 proving that the DSP new policy to prosecute illegal medical advertising and practice did \nwork on the ground.  \nThe application of the DSP\u2019s guidelines to cope with irregular practitioners and their ads \nwas less straightforward in the countryside. Regardless of the procedures to denounce illegal ads \nand prosecute the practitioners who sued them, it was not easy for sanitary delegates to evaluate \nthe legal status of a particular practitioner, especially when newspapers reported on the conflict \nbetween graduates from free medical schools and the DSP. For instance, just a few days after the \nDSP sent the guidelines on how to denounce irregular medical advertisements and pr actice on \nJune, 1931, Ildefonso M\u00e9ndez A., a sanitary agent from Pachuca, Hidalgo, addressed his concern \nof how to proceed with homeopaths who insisted in advertise their services using the title of \ndoctor .49 His concern was major since only two of all home opaths who practiced in the city had \ntheir titles registered in the department. Moreover, he was uncertain about the way to proceed \n                                                             \n47 Report from Aquilino Villanueva, DSP Minister, on April 9, 1935 to the court, in AHSS, SP, SJ, 45, 18, \np. 9-11.  \n48 AHSS, SP, SJ, 45, 18.  \n49 Letter of Dr. Ildefonso M\u00e9ndez addressed to Li c.

Francisco V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez, head \nof the DSP Office of Legal Affairs, replied that all medical practitioners needed to comply with \narticle 158 of the sanitary code .50 He also ratified that all medical practitioners, with or without a \ntitle, needed to inform the DSP about the professional s services they provided and the addresses \nof their consulting offices (art 155 of the sanitary code). He clarified that \u201cnot only those who \npractice the homeopathic system, but anyone withou t a legally recognized degree have the \nobligation to not call themselves doctors, physicians or professionals in general, while they lack \na valid degree that allows them to do so\u201d.51 In Morelia, Michoac\u00e1n, Dr. Antonio D\u00edaz, president \nof the Sanitary Board of Morelia faced a similar situation regarding homeopathy. On November \n10, 1933, he asked the head of the DSP if the sanitary department registered degrees issued by \nthe Free Homeopa thic Institute [ Instituto Libre Homeop\u00e1tico ]. V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez replied that the \nsanitary department did not register those decrees because the school was not official .52  \nWhile straightforward, the response from sanitary authorities in the city stood out for i ts \nindoctrinating tone and for not acknowledging that a legal status of a decree depended on each \nlocal state regulations. For instance, the state of Hidalgo recognized degrees from the ELHM as \nlegal in the 1920s .53 This attitude evidences the urgent need o f sanitary authorities to stop the \nspread of graduates from free medical schools to the countryside. The phenomenon of free \nschools was mainly located in Mexico City, though cases like the ELMP showed sanitary \n                                                             \n50 Response to the letter of Dr. Ildefonoso M\u00e9ndez A., by Francisco V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez, July 31, 1931.  \nAHSS, SP, SJ, 28, 22, p. 1.  \n51 Response to the letter of Dr. Ildefonoso M\u00e9ndez A., by F rancisco V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez, July 31, 1931.  \nAHSS, SP, SJ, 28, 22, p. 1.  \n52 Letter to the minister of public health from Dr. Antonio D\u00edaz, November 10, 1933; and letter from Lic. \nFrancisco V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez to Dr. Antonio D\u00edaz, November 13, 1933, in AHSS, SP, EM, 13 , 2, pp. 1 and 2.  \n53 The decree was published on November 15, 1919; see \u201cEn favor de la ense\u00f1anza\u201d, El Universal , April \n12, 1919.  278 \n authorities that there were free schools in ot her states and that they would organize to demand \nthe right of their degrees to be regarded as legal. The matter became more urgent because the \nnews about the cases graduates from free medical schools won at the SCJN spread to the \ncountryside, apparently m aking sanitary delegates hesitant about the application of the sanitary \ncode. Obligating homeopaths to comply might have not been easy. For instance, Ildefonso \nM\u00e9ndez asked V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez for a \u201cway though which I can obligate homeopaths from this \ntown not use the title of Doctor.\u201d54 Moreover, the assurance that lawsuits against the DSP for \nobligating practitioners to comply with the regulation on medical advertising did not pass might \nhave inclined V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez to reassure sanitary delegates about the their  role as surveyors of \nfulfillment of the sanitary code, rather than complicating their scenario with details about the \nlocal regulation of medical training. The persisting dictatorial attitude of sanitary authorities \nduring the early 1930s made that homeop aths and other graduates from free schools mobilized at \nthe national level when they received news that the sanitary code would be reformed in 1934.  \n\u201cRevolutionary Medicine\u201d?: the Institutionalization of Revolutionary Institutions Stands out \nOver Homeopat hy for Working -Class Mexicans  \nOn August 24, 1934, a new and reformed Sanitary Code was issued. The reaction to the \nnew reforms varied among different actors. The national press received it with enthusiasm. El \nUniversal  one of the major diaries of the capit al believed that it represented a great step against \nthe \u201cmedical charlatanry\u201d .55 In contrast, Alfonso Pruneda, a former DSP officer in the early \n1920s, believed that the \u201ccampaign against charlatanism\u201d needed to be carried out with more \nintensity through a ll possible means, suggesting that improvements in the new legislation fall \n                                                             \n54 Letter of Dr. Ildefonso M\u00e9ndez addressed to Lic. Francisco V\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez, June 12, 1931. AHSS, SP, \nSJ, 28, 22, p. 2.  \n55 See \u201cUn dique al ejercicio de la medicina por charlatantes\u201d, El Universal , September 2, 1934.  279 \n short on what was required .56 The way he described these limitations suggests that he believed \nsanitary authorities coped well with the problem of charlatans who lacked professional  degrees, \nbut could not contain those who indeed had a degree and because of this were \u201cmore dangerous\u201d. \nAs the vignette with which I initiated this chapter and chapters 5 and 6 indicate, the DSP clearly \nidentified who these \u201cdangerous\u201d practitioners were,  those graduated from free schools of \nmedicine, though they or other ENM graduates rarely referred to them explicitly in their \nprofessional journals, classifying them under the obscure and poorly defined term \u201ccharlatans\u201d. \nAs analyzed in chapter 4, the ref orms to the section on medical practice in the sanitary code \nmarginalized even more the places where practitioners who lacked a medical degree, who had \none from free medical schools, or who had one that sanitary authorities did not acknowledge as \nlegal cou ld offer their services. Foreseeing the possible actions that this particular group of \npractitioners could take, the Union of Medical Doctors of the Federal District [ Sindicato de \nM\u00e9dicos Cirujanos del Distrito Federal ] policed their mobilizations and made  them public .57 \nThe union denounced in its journal those affected by the sanitary code who had gathered on \n                                                             \n56 Alfonso Pruneda read his opinion in the National Academy of Medicine on February 20, 1935. See \nPruneda, \"El Nuevo C\u00f3digo Sanitario,\" 400 -01. \n57 The union had b een working, though with the name of Asociaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mexicana , since the early \n1920s. A group of ENM graduates created this association on June 23, 1919 with the aim to morally, \nmaterially, and intellectually improve the conditions of the Mexican medical  practitioners all over the \nnation. Eventually, this society turned into the union sometime around the late 1920s or early 1930s. This \nchange was signaled by the name of its publication; the association published the bulletin Asociaci\u00f3n \nM\u00e9dica Mexicana  and the union published the journal Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica . Unfortunately, earlier and later \npublication year caps of these journals do not suggest a better estimate of the transition from a \nprofessional society to a medical union. Yet that it happened in these ye ars when the state started to \nsupport free medical schools is indicative of ENM graduates\u2019 organization to seek for larger state support. \nBoth the society and the union had a specific group organized to \u201ccombat charlatanism\u201d and frequently \npublished critiq ues and actions taken against practitioners they considered a threat to the profession, as \nwhen the ENMH joined the UNM in the early 1920s or when in 1934 the 1st congress of professionals of \nMexico gathered in Mexico City from which homeopaths, both gradu ates from the ENMH and ELMH, \nwere dismissed. For the creation of the Mexican Medical Association see chapter 5. For critiques against \nhomeopathy and the ENMH see chapter 3 and 5. For the reactions against homeopaths in 1934 and 35 see \njust as a major examp le Manuel Godoy \u00c1lvarez, \"La homeopat\u00eda en M\u00e9xico,\" Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica  V.13 \n(1935). ; for other papers see Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica ,V, 5-6, 7, and 13 -14. 280 \n August 30 and planned to fight against the enforcement of the code. Consequently, it suggested a \nseries of measures to counteract practitioners\u2019 actio ns; notifying the President and the DSP Head \nthat the union sided with the enforcement of the code, convincing other medical associations in \nthe country t o do the same, and designing measures to \u201cneutralize the activities of charlatans \norganized against th e new Federal Sanitary Code\u201d .58 But homeopaths and other graduates from \nfree schools had been politically active earlier in 1934.  \nThat the reforms to the sanitary code passed and were issued in August of that year \nsustains this chapter\u2019s argument about the limits of resistance against the sanitary dictatorship. \nYet the analysis of this attempt to resist a new reform to the sanitary code reveals the persistence \nof homeopathy as a medical system and service provided and used by the working class, by those \nwho either did not have access to or could not afford both an elite medical training at elite \nmedical schools and physicians, most of whom were located in urban centers. This is not to say \nthat homeopathic doctors did not follow the geographical distribution o f ENM -graduated doctors \nin the 1930s, after all most of ELHM or ENMH graduates stayed and practiced in Mexico City .59  \nRather the waves of correspondence that President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez and sanitary \nauthorities received is evidence that homeopathy cont inued being provided and consumed as a \nform of domestic or communitarian medicine both in urban centers and rural communities. Just \nas during the Porfiriato homeopathic doctors and unlicensed homeopathic practitioners argued \n                                                             \n58 Correspondence from Juan Cejudo, Dr. Balend\u00f3n Gil, Carmen Ben\u00edtez, E.

Against the monopolistic efforts to control \nthe medical marketplace carried out by sanitary authorities and the rest of the medical profession, \nhomeopaths tried to convince the president, the congress, and the public opinion that \nhomeopathy was a mild and effective therapy that was suitable for the work ing class because it \nwas harmless and cheap. Consequently, they demanded that a government that sustained the \nrevolution\u2019s ideals of social justice did not side on the monopolistic desires of ENM graduates \nand sanitary authorities.  \nWhat motivated the mobi lization of homeopaths and other graduates from free schools \nwas a new project to regulate article 4 of the Constitution  initiated in December, 1933 .60 The \nleaders of this new regulatory attempt requested all professional organizations and interested \ncitizens to submit their proposals to the commission .61 The possibility to be part of the \nconversations t o regulate the medical profession opened a fierce co ntroversy between \nhomeopaths and allopaths , who used the journals of their professional societies and unions as \nwell as the public press to expose their opinions about the differences in the medical system each \ngroup endorsed, their understanding of what c onstituted adequate medical training, and the \n                                                             \n60 Alberto Bremauntz and Alberto Coria, deputies of a political group within the Chamber of Deputies, \nthe Bloque Nacional Revolutionario [National Revolutionary Bloc], initiated the project; see El Universal \nGrafico , December 11, 1933, in AHSS, SP, EM, 15, 5, pp. 1.  \n61 Some homeopa ths and graduates from free schools specifically sent their responses to the commission\u2019s \nlist with questions about how to undertake a project that regulated art 4 of the constitution, but others took \nthe opportunity to address other related issued and sta rted sending letters to President Abelardo \nRodr\u00edguez.

Rodr\u00edguez received about a hundred letters from \nboth homeopathic doctors and unlicensed practitioners requesting that sanitary authorities \nincorporate homeopaths into the discussion of  the reforms to the sanitary code or that otherwise \n                                                             \n62 For instance, in response to critiques from \u201callopathic do ctors\u201d, the Mexican Homeopathic League \naddressed President Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez to let him know that anytime the government could verify the \nquality of their academic curriculum.

Rodriguez to request the legal recognition of some free medical schools, such as in the case \nof the ELMP that I analyzed above.  \n65 The other strate gy was to organize a Congress of Professionals that gathered all professional societies \nand unions to agree on a regulation that benefited all those interested.

Rodr\u00edguez on January 22, 1934, in AH SS, SP, EM, 13, 14, p. 2.  283 \n these reforms did not marginalize their practice even further .66 About 20% of them came from \nMexico City or the less populated areas surrounding the city; another 20% came from \nMichoac\u00e1n, Coahuila, M\u00e9xico,  and Jalisco; the rest came from other 18 states and even one from \nPer\u00fa.67 Most practitioners had graduated from the ILHM or ELMP and only a couple had \nregistered with the DSP; some practitioners called themselves \u201cdoctors\u201d despite not being \nincluded in the  registry. All graduates from the ELHM were registered and all of them signed \nusing the prefix \u201cdoctor\u201d. Most practitioners and doctors were members of local or national \nmedical associations such as the Mexican Homeopathic Confederation, the Mexican \nHomeop athic League, the Homeopathic Society Dr. Hering, the Homeopathic Society of Puebla, \nthe Homeopathic Society of Sinaloa, the Society of Homeopathic Doctors of Durango, the \nHomeopathic Society of Guerrero, and the Homeopathic Association of Doctors from La \nLaguna . This mobilization had no precedents in terms of the groups that participated in it, the \nway the actions those groups took, and the geographical origins of the complaints. If \nhomeopathic doctors were the only ones who protested as individuals in pre vious years, this time \nhomeopathic practitioners and even patients summed their requests to homeopathic doctors who \nacted within their professional societies and unions.  \nMost of the correspondence simply requested that homeopaths could participate in the \nelaboration of the new sanitary code, and Manuel F. Madrazo, head of the DSP, or Francisco \nV\u00e1zquez P\u00e9rez, head of the DSP\u2019s Office of Medical Practice, just replied that their opinions \n                                                             \n66 Approximately 60 homeopathic practitioners, 10 homeopathic doctors, and 70 patients. See AHSS, SP, \nEM, 13, 5; AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 11; AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 12; AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 14  \n67 The majority of petition letters issued by homeopa thic practitioners or doctors came from Mexico City \n(about 40), followed by the state of Michoac\u00e1n. Other states were only represented by one, two or three \nletters (Morelos, Coahuila, Durgano, Puebla, Mexico, Zamora, Colima, Guanajuato, San Luis Potos\u00ed, \nSinaloa, Hidalgo, Veracruz, Texcoco, Chihuahua, Baja California and Tampaulipas). Puebla and \nVeracruz are special cases, for if patients are considered, then about 65 persons from Puebla sent petition \nletters to the President and the head of the DSP, and 14 from Veracruz.  284 \n would be taken into consideration .68 Opinions varied amongst those homeop aths who responded \nto DSP\u2019s invitation. Some homeopaths sent a simple letter notifying the DSP that they sided with \nthe opinion of the Mexican Homeopathic Confederation .69 Others elaborated on critiques to the \nDSP\u2019s regulation of medical practice. In genera l, these letters requested that the DSP authorized \nthe practice of homeopaths whether doctors or unlicensed practitioners. This could be achieved, \nso these letter proposed, by regulating articles 4 of the Constitution , by providing venues in the \nsanitary c ode that allowed the practice of homeopaths, by allowing the registration of degrees \ngranted by free medical schools, among other legal means.  \nWhen arguing in favor of the legal practice of homeopathy in the country, homeopaths \nand their patients used a s ocial democratic rhetoric to align with the revolutionary rhetoric of \ngovernment authorities to obtain their support. One aspect of this rhetoric was to p ortray the \nconflict between homeopaths and allopaths as a class struggle. For example, Dr. Jos\u00e9 M. \nMendoza, a member of the Homeopathic Society of Puebla, believed that the attitude against \nhomeopaths resulted from the elitist education of allopaths, their close relationship to the \npolitical class, and their ability to obtain bureaucratic positions .  \nOn th e contrary [to what happened in the Porfiriato , he said,] today in a time of \nliberty [\u2026] revolutionary governors in conjunction with their professional allies, \nunrealized professional who issue laws, such as in Puebla and other states, fight \nagainst the ci vilization and the Mexican nationalism. [\u2026A]llopaths, taking \nadvantage of their position in the government, or as legislators, [\u2026] want to \nimpose a STATE MEDICINE to the Mexican people. Has by any chance Mexico \ngone years back in scientific matters? Our li beral institutions and laws [\u2026] deny a \nRELIGION OF THE STATE . Why the MEDICINE OF THE STATE , which \nallopathic physicians want to impose , is not condemned on the same grounds and \nin the name of scientific freedom?\u201d70  \n                                                             \n68 See El Universal , January 26, 1934, and La Prensa , January 27, 1934; El Nacional , January 25, 1934.  \n69 Like Mariano Torres Pico, Pedro Castro, Santiago J.

Mendo za, January 11, 1934, AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 11, pp. 2 -4.  285 \n  \nMar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez de Origel, head of a beneficence institution that protected women and teenagers \nin Guadalajara, argued that homeopathy sided the \u201cproletariat, the working class and the people\u201d, \nand for that reason she considered it \u201crevolutionary and democratic .71 And patients described the \nbenefits of homeopathy as ones that fitted the least affluent class. A. Maga\u00f1a argued that \nhomeopathy was economic and efficient, which made it a suitable therapy for the \u201cworking class \nand peasants\u201d .72 The privileged position of allopaths allowed them to f avor laws that banned \nhomeopathic practice.  \nClass struggle could also be interpreted as professional competition and consequently the \nconflict was pictured as an economic one where patients became both arbiters and victims. Dr. \nFidel M. Garcia, member of the Homeopathic Society of Sinaloa, believed that allopaths did not \nlike homeopathy because patients preferred it and this reduced allopaths\u2019 income; having laws \nthat allowed \u201chomeopathic practitioners to offer their services only where there was no licens ed \nphysician could be interpreted as a defense of a mercantile monopoly , and not as a sanitary \nmeasure t hat benefited the whole society\u201d,  he said .73 Patients\u2019 preference was evident in a letter \nfrom 13 patients and one homeopathic practitioner from Tuxpan, Veracruz, who had used \nallopathy without any result until they used homeopathy and they healed. They argued, \nconsequently, that allopathy was the therapeutic approach that killed, not homeopathy. Juan \nZepeda Garbay, a practitioner from Tenancingo, believed  that allopaths with its elitist education, \npolitical connections, and government positions were trying to build a professional monopoly; he \nalso thought that if the government allowed free medical practice, the public would become the \njudge of what was ri ght or wrong in medical science, undermining allopaths\u2019 privileged \n                                                             \n71 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 24  \n72 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 15, pp. 39 and 50  \n73 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 12, pp. 27  286 \n position .74 Enrique Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez, a practitioner from Mazatl\u00e1n, Sinaloa, located the origin of \nthe conflict in mercantilism, but contrary to Juan Zepeda, he visualized a future of patien ts\u2019 \nexploitation without the homeopathic counterweight, if their political position tilted the outcome \nin favor of allopaths .75 Some patients like Paula G. de Rivera \u2014 and 4 more patients  \u2014 believed \nthat patient\u2019s choice favored homeopaths and that it was p recisely for this reason that allopaths \nconsidered homeopaths true competitors and attacked them .76 Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez de Origel \ntranslated medical approaches to economic reasons that favored homeopathy. For her, \nhomeopaths\u2019 resistance to use patent medicines, and their wide use of national plants, practices \nthat opposed allopaths\u2019 preferences, promoted the growth of a national economy .77 \nA third issue was the status of homeopathy as medical knowledge based on scientific \nfoundations and the access to scientific m edical knowledge and consequently proper medical \ntraining to the working class. Francisco A. Gonz\u00e1lez, a practitioner from Coahuila argued that \nhomeopathy had the same legal rights as allopathy because the former was as scientific as the \nlatter. Ram\u00f3n Garc \u00eda Morales, a violinist from the National Conservatory in Mexico City, \nconsidered that homeopathy had scientific foundations and that he would turn into a non -believer \nonly until there was clear evidence of the empiricism and lack of scientific principles in it.78 \nMoreover, he argued that the only way to solve the conflict was recognizing homeopathy\u2019s \nscientific foundations and supporting the ELHM which trained doctors without the economic \nsupport from the government .79 In the same line of reasoning, Maria Go nz\u00e1lez de Origel \n                                                             \n74 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 69  \n75 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 79  \n76 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 11, pp. 83  \n77 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 71 -73 \n78 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 11, pp. 53  \n79 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 67 -68. 287 \n considered homeopathy a science that needed to be included in the educational system because it \nwas useful. She argued that she had been successfully using it in the institution she headed .80 \nHomeopaths and their patients did not like being  held as charlatans neither for their \ntherapeutic beliefs nor for their training. Jos\u00e9 M. Mendoza said that homeopaths had documents \nthat proved their long training which turn them into \u201cauthentic homeopathic doctors\u201d, contrary to \nwhat sanitary authorities  argued. Yet if sanitary authorities accused free medical schools of \nlacking enough practical training, it was the government\u2019s responsibility, for  \nhow could someone demand high quality medical training from a free school, \nwhen a short minded government s toned the school? How could a free school be \nefficient when a governor issued draconian decrees against homeopathic doctors? \nHow could someone demand with such na\u00efvet\u00e9 that free schools trained top -class \nprofessionals, when those schools never received eco nomic support from the \ngovernment, as official ones did? How could an authority, however well \nintentioned, with such carelessness, request such a high -quality medical training \nin free schools if precisely the same authority obstructed its operations and de nied \nclinical practice to free schools\u2019 students in government hospitals?81 \n \nLike others, he suggested the complete legal recognition of homeopathic professional education \nand the official recognition of homeopathy as a medical science . \nOne of the letters is particularly relevant because it radically contrasted with other \nhomeopaths\u2019 perspective and Juan Mendoza\u2019s in particular. Generally ELHM graduates had a \nspecial appreciation for their school. The spirit of altruism and the flag of ho meopathy pushed \nthem to praise the education they had received from this particular medical free school, but Dr. \nRuben Reyes Segura felt deceived by the school. He had two titles, one from the ELHM and one \nfrom the UNAM. He explained to sanitary authoritie s that he first studied homeopathy at the \nELHM because he believed that it had scientific principles, but that after four years of studies he \nrealized that both the homeopathic doctrine and the school were not trustworthy. Therefore, Dr. \n                                                             \n80 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 24.  \n81 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 12, pp. 5 -7. 288 \n Ruben Reyes decide d to study medicine at the ENM, where he finally realized that the \nhomeopathic school only exploited \u201cthe ignorance of the masses, protected by the law that gave \nit legal status\u201d. Arguing that he never practiced homeopathy and had only practice \u201cthe other \nmedicine\u201d, he believed that his \u201cmistake had already been corrected\u201d and that his honesty \u201chad \nerased any stain on his medical career\u201d. Foreseeing that he could be fined for prescribing \nmedicines he was not entitled to after the enforcement of the new Sani tary Code, he requested \nthe head of the DSP\u2019s Office of Medical Practice and Demography to erase his name from the \nsection of homeopaths, but the sanitary authority replied that the Directory was already \npublished .82  \nOnly the Union of Homeopathic Physician s and the Mexican Homeopathic League \noffered a systematic critique of the parts of the Sanitary Code of 1928 that directly affected \nmedical practice to homeopaths, critiques and suggestions that homeopaths wanted to be \nincluded in the new one. The Mexican Homeopathic Confederation to which several homeopaths \npledge allegiance endorsed the document offered by the League. The union, represented by Dr. \nOthon Johnson, a graduate of the ELHM, and by Dr. Rosendo Rojas Esta\u00f1ol, also an ELHM \ngraduate, criticized th e criteria followed to register degrees issued by free schools, the timing \nwhen a doctor was obliged to issue a death certificate, in the sanitary code of 1926, and the \nintention to ban homeopaths from the practice of surgery and obstetrics in the new one .83 The \nunion believed that free schools\u2019 degrees should be recognized as official, if the titles fulfilled \ncertain criteria. They needed to have been previously recognized by any federal or local \ngovernment through any of its offices; the issuing medical sc hool needed to have academic \nprograms officially validated by such offices; and both the medical degrees and the free school \n                                                             \n82 AHSS, SP, EM, 13, 5, pp. 88 -89 \n83 AHSS, SP, SM, 13, 5, pp. 81 -84 289 \n needed to fulfill other specific requirements established by the granting government. According \nto the union\u2019s opinion, doctors wer e obliged to provide a medical certificate only if their patient \ndied 48 hours after they issued the last prescription. Families of the deceased patient and police \nagents , the union argued , did not have any medical training and requested death certificates  when \ndoctors could no longer be held responsible for the death person, or when the patient or its family \ndid not adequately follow the doctor\u2019s prescription, discontinued it, or had done extensive use of \nother therapies, such as home remedies, potions, or  spiritualist interventions, without the doctors\u2019 \nconsent. In its final point, the union complained about the intention to marginalize homeopaths\u2019 \npractice by considering them only specialists in internal medicine, without the proper training to \noffer thei r services as surgeons or obstetricians. Doctors from the \u201ctraditional school\u201d wanted to \nreserve surgical and obstetrical knowledge to their own and failed to understand that homeopaths \nwere also trained as doctors and, consequently, were able to fulfill c ompletely their role in the \nsociety, the union concluded.  \nThe opinions of the Mexican Homeopathic League coincided with some of the Union\u2019s \nopinions and advanced other ones. For instance, the League pointed out that the new sanitary \ncode needed to conside r free schools from states beyond the Federal District, but argued that it \nwas necessary to have a new government office beyond the UNAM that validated free schools\u2019 \ndegrees and their academic curricula. The League believed that homeopaths were trained as \nsurgeons and obstetricians, but also as a homeopathic pharmacist. Consequently, it demanded \nthat the right of every graduate of a homeopathic school to be in charge of pharmacies and \ndispensaries be observed in the new code. On the issue of death certifica tes, the League \nconsidered that it was the duty of judicial authorities to provide this and other types of \ncertificates that demanded expert knowledge.  290 \n The League\u2019s letter highlighted how the sanitary code of 1926 obstructed homeopathic \ndoctors\u2019 practice a nd how the code contradicted the Constitution, yet its suggestions to reform \nthe code revealed the League\u2019s unawareness of how the sanitary police proceeded or its lack of \nlegal experience. This suggests that while supporting medical schools, the League, b eing \nintegrated by ELHM graduates who were already registered with the DSP, saw the economic \nbenefits of the sanitary control of medical practice, once they were on the side of regular \npractitioners. The way the code restricted medical advertisements confl icted with article 4 of the \nConstitution, though they agreed with advertising clearly the origin of their degree or the lack of \nit. A similar situation happened with the ability of sanitary authorities to eliminate previously \nregistered doctors who did not  comply with new laws. This regulation opposed to article 6 of the \nConstitution, which stipulated that the law could not be retroactively applied. The League \nbelieved that only in cases of fake degrees or when the degree was not backed up by proper \ntrainin g the registry could be withdrawn, a proposition that evidence the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the League \nand its lack of knowledge of the situation of other free medical schools, such as the ELMP or the \nELOE.  \nOne of the most important issues in terms of therapeutic tools  that homeopaths could \nmake use of as surgeons and obstetricians was narcotics. The League requested that homeopaths \ncould use prohibited plants such as Cannabis indica , Cannabis sativa , and Opium , based on the \nextensive evidence homeopaths had of their therapeutic effectiveness at infinitesimal doses. On \nthe other side, it demanded their right as surgeons and obstetricians to use narcotics at high \ndoses, for palliative as well as anesthetic purpos es. This contradiction is just the surface of a \ndeeper problem amongst the medical profession which was the wide variety of therapeutic \napproaches and the anxiety of sanitary authorities to regulate who was properly trained to use a 291 \n specific therapeutic ap proach and how specific practitioners approached the use of such \ntherapeutic tools. However fascinating the history of the production, cultivation, transformation, \nsynthesis, commercialization, and consumption of medicinal plants and other commercial and \nnon-commercial drugs might be, this topic is beyond the scope of this dissertation. Yet the \nactivity of homeopaths as retailers of their own specific homeopathic drugs made them the target \nnot only of sanitary policies that aimed to regulate the production and retailing of pharmaceutical \nproducts in the 1920s and 30s, but also of the growing community of professional pharmacists, \nwho regarded homeopathic pharmaceutical activity as an intromission to their professional \nactivities and as competitor in the mark etplace of medical commodities .84  \nJust as with the Congress of Professionals from which homeopaths were dismissed, they \nwere never required to attend any meeting to discuss the reforms to the new sanitary code. \nMadrazo publicly acknowledged that he would l isten to homeopaths suggestions and even asked \nthem to submit their opinion; these written opinions did not produce any change in the sanitary \ncode of 1934. Moreover, the modifications to the section on medical practice did not listen to \nhomeopaths\u2019 sugges tions. In fact new modifications openly marginalized homeopaths\u2019 medical \npractice in the way homeopaths had anticipated in their letters early that year. The Union of \nHomeopathic Physicians complained to sanitary authorities using the same arguments alread y \n                                                             \n84 Juli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s and Pascual Bielsa\u2019s homeopathic dispensaries were the first examples of these \ntensions between the Superior Board of Health and homeopaths in the 1860s and 70s (see particularly \nchapter 1 and 4). Pharmacists complained that homeopaths f illed up themselves their own prescriptions in \n\"Intereses profesionales. La homeopat\u00eda. Falta de cumplimiento de la ley.

More than exposing homeopaths\u2019 arguments that justified their right and proper \ntraining to use anesthetics in surgery and prescribe narcotics in specific cases, the lawsuit offers \nan insight of how magistrates privileged the structure and duties of state institutions which stood \nfor the social good rather than the constitutional rights of a few citizens. Homeopaths sued the \nPresident and the DSP at a local civilian court and they lost the case because, according to the \nverdict, the sanitary code was a piece of legislation that protected society\u2019s interests. If it was \nrevoked to give rights back to homeopaths, the verdict would re instate a situation which the \nsanitary code intended to remediate in the first place. But when h omeopaths appealed this verdict \nto the SCJN, the Supreme Court acknowledged the excesses contained in the code, particularly \nregarding the prescription of narcotics and the intromission of sanitary authorities in the \nregulation of medical practice. When th e DSP appealed this resolution, the SCJN one more time \nacknowledged that the DSP\u2019s acts were susceptible to suspension, but the Supreme Court argued \nthat it was more important \u201cfor the society and the state that each organic institution fulfilled its \n                                                             \n85 Correspondence from the Union of Homeopathic Physicians to the head of the DSP, September 24, \n1934, AHSS, SP, SJ, 41, 10.

Having this as the central value of governance gave homeopaths no means to contest \nthe sanitary dictatorship.86  \nConclusions  \nThe triumph of advocates for the regularization of the Free School of Homeopathy of \nMexico in 1929 and 1930 opened the possibility for other graduates from free medical schools in \nMexico City to seek the regularization of their own medical schools and degrees. As I have \nshown in the f irst section of this chapter, these graduates took advantage of the presidential \ndecrees that allowed them to seek the regularization of their schools with the Ministry of Public \nEducation in 1930 and 1931. But the changing politics of the Maximato did not  allow a \nconsistent policy regarding the regulation of free schools and of professional education in \ngeneral. The new Organic Law of the UNM in 1932 brought legal inconsistencies that both the \nSEP and the DSP took advantage of to get rid of the problem of regulating medical schools. The \nshifting role of the SEP from an office in favor of regulating medical schools to an office that \nopposed to it remains to be studied, yet an explanation can still be found either in the conflicting \nrelationship between unive rsity authorities and the recently created office that aimed to regulate \nprofessional training within the SEP or in the state\u2019s need to establish a coherent state structure \nthat regulated professional practice through adequate professional training, as the  SCJN\u2019s \nresolution in favor of the sanitary code of 1934 suggests. In any case, with the SEP stepping back \nfrom its role as regulator of professional training, the DSP assumed such a role specifically for \nfree medical schools.  \n                                                             \n86 The entire lawsuit is in AHSS, SP, SJ, 41, 10 . For the appeal\u2019s resolution see the report from the SCJN \nto President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas and his Ministry of Health in AHSS, SP, SJ, 41, 10, pp. 81 -84. 294 \n Sanitary authorities took ad vantage of the legal and government position of the DSP at \nthe national level. The sanitary code made the medical registry the basis for enforcing a policy \nthat marginalized free -schools graduates from advertising their services as professional medical \ndoctors. At the same time, the presence of sanitary agents in the most important urban centers in \nthe nation made feasible the prosecution of those practitioners who did not comply with \nregulations on medical advertising. The enforcement of these policies cre ated the need in free -\nschools graduates to be included in the medical registry. Yet, they believed they had the right to \nbe included in the latter because their degrees were legal. After all not only had they received \nmedical training in a medical school, but also some of their schools had been legally authorized. \nThe cases analyzed in this chapter indicate that the DSP\u2019s resistance to register some of the free -\nschools -issued medical degrees was ideologically -based, rather than legally -based. In other \nwords , the enforcement of the sanitary dictatorship to control medical practice was based on the \nanxieties of sanitary authorities rather than the potential or actual harm that free -schools \ngraduates inflicted to their patients. The legal strategies devised by sanitary authorities to prevent \nthese practitioners from enrolling in the sanitary code were dictatorial, intransigent, and illegal. \nSanitary authorities were cautious when implementing such measures to prevent a flood of \nlawsuits as they had experienced d uring the 1920s with ELHM graduates. Consequently, sanitary \nauthorities carefully aligned with regulations that allowed them to dismiss free -schools \ngraduates\u2019 requests to be included in the medical registry. In turn, only exceptionally the latter \nwere abl e to win lawsuits against the DSP and become \u201clegal\u201d medical doctors.  \nHowever, it would be misleading to p ortray sanitary authorities as simply enforcing \npolicies out of ideology. As I explained in chapter 5, the DSP did not originally enforce the \nregulat ions on medical practice contained in the sanitary code of 1926. And, as evidence in this 295 \n chapter suggest, even when enforcing it, sanitary authorities did not apply sanitary regulations \nunilaterally. Practitioners were summoned to the DSP\u2019s or the sanitar y agents\u2019 offices and \noffered an explanation of the regulation on medical advertising. They were fined only after \nreceiving several warnings. This environment of communication between authorities and \npractitioners drastically changed after the ELHM obtaine d the state support in 1930. Thence, \nsanitary authorities changed their policy to promote compliance to a policy of enforcement \nthrough prosecution. This reaction was the product of sanitary authorities\u2019 realiz ation that \n\u201ccharlatans\u201d who held a professiona l medical degree would not easily comply with sanitary \nregulations regarding medical practice and, moreover, that state policies on professional training \nbacked them up. In other words, free -schools graduates happened to be a more politically active \nand ef fective group than sanitary authorities expected. The real problem for sanitary authorities \nin the 1930s was, as Pruneda put it, \u201ccharlatans with a medical degree\u201d. When these \u201ccharlatans\u201d \nachieved a regular status, sanitary authorities responded using the  vantage position they had in \nthe government structure and did not let any resistance mobilization to overcome the sanitary \ndictatorship.   \nThe last ma jor mobilization of homeopaths \u2014 including practitioners, and patients; \nregular  and irregular; licensed a nd without license \u2014 revealed that they had appropriated the \nworking -class culture of organization typical of urban centers, particularly Mexico City, in the \n1920s and 30s .87 The process through which homeopaths sought state support was not new. They \nhad be en requesting the presidential support since the late 19th century with Porfirio D\u00edaz. Yet, \nwhile they still used the rhetoric of homeopathy as a scientific medicine, the rhetoric that socially \njustified the existence of homeopathy changed dramatically. Wh ile in the Porfiriato homeopathic \ndoctors argued that a medical school would reduce the amount of untrained homeopathic \n                                                             \n87 See for instance, Lear, Workers, Neighbors, and  Citizens: the Revolution in Mexico City . 296 \n practitioners, in the 1930s, homeopaths argued that their therapeutic approach fit the interest of a \nrevolutionary government. Homeopath y, according to this argument, was a therapy suitable for \nthe working class because homeopaths\u2019 services and homeopathic medicines were inexpensive \nand because most of its practitioners belong to a sector of the population who could hardly pay \nfor an elite  medical training such as ENM students. Consequently, supporters of homeopathy \nargued that the government would be aligning with the ideals of the revolution if it supported \nhomeopathy; revolutionary medicine for a revolutionary government. Yet in contrast  to the \nPorfiriato , the social democratic rhetoric did not work; at least not in the terms homeopaths \nwanted. The state was more interested in organizing a consistent legal and government structure \nthat provided certainty to the regulation of public life, particularly the regulation of public health, \nrather than fulfilling the demands of working -class homeopathic practitioners. This policy \nworked out in the courts and  left the regulatory framework, the sanitary code  in particular,  \nuntouched, turning homeopa ths protests\u2019 into \u201chomeopathic sugar\u201d that combated sanitary \n\u201ccannons\u201d.  \n 297 \n Epilogue and Conclusions  \nThe last and closing chapter of this dissertation shows that homeopaths\u2019 efforts to resist the \nsanitary dictatorship were unfruitful and ther efore suggests that homeopathy as a national \nworking -class medical movement faded away. The sanitary dictatorship was effective in keeping \nthe control of medical practice regulations in the hands of sanitary authorities. This did not imply \nthat in practice  homeopathy did not persist as a rhetorical tool to demand health and healing \nservices and practical tool that delivered health and healing services to the working class, or that \nhomeopathy was no longer offered as an option of medical training to the work ing class. Rather \nthe opposite. For instance, j ust five months after the new sanitary code was issued in 1934, \nMiguel Hidalgo Salazar and Antonio Loyo, General Secretary and Secretar y of Social Action of \nthe Confederation of Peasants \u201cEmiliano Zapata\u201d of P uebla, addressed President L\u00e1zaro \nC\u00e1rdenas to request that homeopaths were not prosecuted . According to Salazar and Loyo, \nhomeopaths were truly an  \nefficacious  social service, particularly for the disenfranchised sick people. [\u2026] \nThey are closer to the proletariat because most of them come from its ranks, \npaying for their education, and consequently they deserve the protection that [the \nConfederation] requests, giving the warrants they need to pursue they \nhumanitarian labor.   \n \nThey contrasted homeopaths\u2019 humanitarian labor with that of \u201callopaths\u201d who, they believed, \nwere the ones who promoted the prosecution. They were the ones who look after their own \npersonal \u2014 and not the collective interests \u2014 so Salazar and Loyo believed. \u201cIf allopathic \nphysicians understood the higher role they play in society, they would act accordingly and \nconsequently would not interfere with homeopaths [\u2018s undertakings]\u201d, the leaders o f the \nconfederation concluded.1  \n                                                             \n1 AHSS, SP, SJ, 29, 14.  298 \n This intervention shows that the idea that homeopathy was a medical system suitable for \nthe working class, originally conceived in Mexico City in the context of the marginalizing \npolicies of sanitary authorities and ENM fac ulty against the ELHM in the early 1920s, spread out \nto other urban centers beyond the capital city by the mid 1930s. This should not result as a \nsurprise given that Puebla as Mexico City had a homeopathic medical school that offered \nmedical training and w hose graduates confronted both local and federal sanitary authorities. \nSanitary authorities might have retained the control over medical practice regulations and aimed \nto marginalize homeopathic practice, but by perceiving homeopaths as suitable for their needs, \nworking class patients emphasized the need for regulations that incorporated rather than \ndismissed homeopathic practice. Hence, regardless of the regulatory control gained by sanitary \nauthorities in the first half of the 1930s, in practice there was  a medical marketplace both in \nMexico City and other urban centers in Mexico such as Puebla that demanded the services of \nhomeopaths.  \nA different question is how influential such demands were in orienting public policies \nregarding the regulation of homeop athic training and practice in the 1930s. This question \nrequires further research to evaluate the growth and regulation of homeopathic medical schools \nin urban centers beyond Mexico City. In other words, it is necessary to evaluate both \nhomeopaths\u2019 efforts  to create and sustain new and existing medical schools in other states such \nas Puebla and Jalisco, where homeopathic schools either existed or were being built, and \nunderstand how local state laws regarding professional medical practice evolved during the  \n1920s and 30s in response to the centralization of government during C\u00e1rdenas administration \n(1934 \u201340). On one side, the federal government did not have an immediate and straightforward \nresponse to demands such as Salazar\u2019s and Loyo\u2019s. As it happened with  homeopaths\u2019 demands in 299 \n Mexico City in the late 1920s, the President handed over the Confederation of Peasants \n\u201cEmiliano Zapata\u201d of Puebla \u2019s demand to the DSP. Moreover, if the DSP policies during the \nearly 1930s are considered, it is unlikely that the san itary department ever took any actions to \nfulfill the Confederation\u2019s demands. On the other, the emergence of free homeopathic medical \nschools in other urban centers in Mexico, such as Guadalajara, took place at a historical moment \nwhen C\u00e1rdenas centralizi ng regime favored the reopening of the ENMH at the IPN rather than \nsupported individual efforts such as ELHM\u2019s. These federal policies altogether with the \nprofessional competition that the opening of a new school implied made difficult and sometimes \neven h indered the efforts to open new homeopathic medical schools beyond Mexico City. For \ninstance, On\u00e9simo R. G\u00f3mez struggled to create a free homeopathic medical school in \nGuadalajara, Jalisco due to economic conflicts with both other homeopaths who supported him \nin the project and other doctors who saw all homeopaths as competitors in the emerging medical \nmarket place in the capital of that state2. The fate of this school and other similar efforts such as \nthe ELMP and the School of Homeopathic Medicine of Yuca t\u00e1n will illuminate how and if the \nprocess of state intervention worked in these states as it did in Mexico City.  \nIn Mexico City, the consolidation of state institutions during the C\u00e1rdenas administration \nthreatened one more time to ban the ELHM in Mexico  City. As I analyzed in chapter 3, L\u00e1zaro \nC\u00e1rdenas\u2019 government initiated a series of reforms with the SEP aimed to professionalize the \nworking class that resulted in the creation of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City. \nThis institution incorp orated the ENMH, perhaps as a response to homeopaths\u2019 demands. Yet the \nrecognition of homeopathy as an option of professional medical training to the working class by \nthe state was accompanied by the latter\u2019s effort to centralize administration. This resul ted in a \n                                                             \n2 This took place during the last three years of the 1920s. On\u00e9simo R. G\u00f3mez was an ELHM graduate. \nSee \u201cEpistolario. Dr. Higino G. P\u00e9rez y On\u00e9simo R. G\u00f3mez\u201d in the Archive of Dr. Fernando D ar\u00edo \nFrancois -Flores in Mexico City.  300 \n series of policies aimed to rule out competing homeopathic medical schools with a similar \nfunction. Just as the SCJN valued the coherence and unity of state institutions that protected the \nsociety over the rights of individuals whose actions confl icted with such institutions in lawsuits \nbetween homeopaths and the DSP, C\u00e1rdenas\u2019 government aimed to unify its government \nstructure. Hence, the SEP initiated a campaign to close the ELHM once the Institute became a \nreality in the second half of the 1930s3. Based on the regulations that gave SEP authorities the \nright to extend or withdraw the authorization to grant medical degrees to professional schools \nthat did not fulfill academic and/or other type of requirements, the SEP attempted to close the \nELHM. I n a mobilization similar to the one organized in the 1920s, ELHM graduates were able \nto keep their medical school working, though the elementary and middle schools associated to it \nwere closed. Apparently the logic was that if the state was funding the pro fessional training of \nhomeopaths through the IPN, there were no apparent reasons to keep an independent medical \nschool working. Yet the details of this conflict and its significance in the context of the changes \nthat took place during C\u00e1rdenas\u2019 administrat ion remain to be researched and analyzed.  \nThe revolutionary state and its institutions inherited the ideological conflict between \npolitical and economic liberalism and positivism in the 19th century. This ideological conflict in \nthe 20th century, which the Mexican historian Javier Garciadiego Dantan has identified as the \nstruggle between \u201c rudos vs. cient\u00edficos \u201d or roughs and scientists, did not end up with the \nconsolidation of the university as a revolutionary institution in the early 192 0s under \nVasconcelos\u2019 lead4. Rather it continued throughout the 1920s and eventually resulted in the \nideological, though not financial, excision of the university from state control. During the 1930s, \n                                                             \n3 See lawsuits against the President and the Ministry of Public Education in 1939, 1940 and 1941 in the \nAHELHM.  \n4 See Javier Garciadiego Dantan, Rudos contra cient\u00edficos : la Universidad Nacional durante la \nRevoluci\u00f3n  mexicana , 1. ed.

These reforms began with an amendment to article 3 of the Constitution to \nmake socialism the educational philosophy endorsed by the state. Yet in C\u00e1rdenas\u2019 \nadministration this meant that he  aimed to subsume science to the social needs of the nation.  \nDue to the conflicts between the Mexican state and the UNAM, C\u00e1rdenas policies were \nnot undertaken by the latter, which continued training social elites in the 1920s though \nimplementing Cardenas \u2019 designed programs to socialize the elitist professionals, particularly \nphysicians5. Rather, he created the Consejo Nacional de la Educaci\u00f3n Superior y la \nInvestigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica  [National Board of Superior Education and Scientific Research] in 1936 \nto implement the policies on professional training and scientific research that the nation required6 \nand the Oficina Nacional de Control y Registro de Escuelas y Titulos Profesionales  [National \nOffice of Control and Registry of Professional Schools and Degrees ] in 1937 to supervise and \nregulate the granting of professional degrees.7 The SEP\u2019s role in this new structural organization \nwas reduced to administer the largest vocational professional school during the C\u00e1rdenas\u2019 \nadministration, the IPN. The effect of t hese policies in medical training and practice remain to be \nthoroughly researched. The evidence analyzed in this dissertation suggests that the three larger \nmedical schools in Mexico City, the ENM, the ENMH, and the ENM, were the most important \ncenters of medical training throughout the 1930s in the capital and would remain as such until \n                                                             \n5 See for instance Gabriela Soto -Laveaga\u2019s work on the medical social service initiated during Gustavo \nBaz Prada\u2019s term as the UNAM\u2019s dean in Gabriela Soto Laveaga, \"Bringing the Revolution to Medical \nSchools: Social Service and a Rural Health Emphasis in 1 930s Mexico,\" Estudios Mexicanos/Mexican \nStudies  29.2 (2013).  \n6 See Miguel Angel Guti\u00e9rrez L\u00f3pez, \"El Consejo Nacional de la Educaci\u00f3n Superior y la Investigaci\u00f3n \nCient\u00edfica y la pol\u00edtica de educaci\u00f3n del r\u00e9gimen cardenista, 1935 -1940,\" Perfiles Educativos  XXXI.126 \n(2009).  \n7 See Moreno, Yankee Don't Go Home! : Mexican Nationalism, American Business Culture, and the \nShaping of Modern Mexico, 1920 -1950   22-3. 302 \n the late 20th century when other private universities started to populate the institutional \nlandscape.  \nAs throughout the period that I analyze in this dissertation, during C\u00e1rdenas\u2019 \nadministration legislators did not agree to issue a piece of legislation that regulated article 3 of \nthe Constitution and clearly establish which professions required their practitioners to have a \ndegree in order to offer their services. The mobi lization of unions and professional associations \nwas originally intended to push for this regulation, but facing the lack of response from the \nCongress, the executive created the National Office to regulate professional schools and degree \ngranting. This of fice aligned with the original intention that led to the creation of National Board \nin terms of transferring to the state the responsibility to supervise and regulate professional \ntraining and schools, which originally laid in the UNAM. By creating this of fice, C\u00e1rdenas \nattended the demands of the liberal professionals who sought for mechanisms to regulate \nprofessional practice and the market of professional services, on one side, yet retained the control \nover the training institutions that produced such pr ofessionals perhaps preventing that the source \nof professionals was not determined by the market but by the state\u2019s perceived social needs, on \nthe other. When the Congress passed the regulation of professions in 1943, the SEP was given \nfull authority over the granting of professional degrees, though preventions remained that \nallowed practicing professionals \u2014 those who did not attend a professional school \u2014 to obtain \nlicenses to practice their profession.8  \nDuring the Cardenas\u2019 administration, institutions that regulated professional training and \nlicensing implemented programs that responded to the need to bring health to rural populations, \nsuch as the creation of the national social service for physicians and the IPN\u2019s school of rural \n                                                             \n8 See Moreno, Yankee Don't Go Home! : Mexican Nationalism, American Business Culture, and the \nShaping  of Modern Mexico, 1920 -1950   24. 303 \n medicine.9 Similarly, the DSP created and administered, in coordination with other federal \ngovernment institutions such as the Minister of Agriculture and local governments, the Unidades \nSanitarias Ejidales  [County Sanitary Units], perhaps the larger effort during C\u00e1rdenas \nadmi nistration to provide comprehensive healthcare as part of a program to improve the \nsocioeconomic conditions of rural populations.10 These units were county sanitary cooperatives \nwhere sanitary, agricultural and local authorities combined efforts to provide what is considered \nthe first effort to combine preventative medicine with social welfare. Consequently, C\u00e1rdenas \nsanitary policy was combined with the distribution of land, the construction of infrastructure that \nbrought pure water to rural towns, the educ ation of peasants and workers on sanitary matters, the \ncreation of cooperatives to fund local and small sanitary insurance services, and similar \nendeavors. C\u00e1rdenas and the DSP\u2019s minister also promoted other projects to bring health services \nto the country side and particularly to rural populations such as a hospital in Torre\u00f3n, Coahuila, a \ncenter of rural hygiene in Santa Ana, Sonora, and the Autonomous Department of Matters of \nIndigenous People, under the supervision of the DSP, among others. These policie s ran along the \ncreation of research institutions such as the Institute of Hygiene, the School of Public Health, and \nthe Institute of Public Health and Tropical Diseases. All these policies and structural changes \nsignaled the need to change the structure o f the DSP to respond to a new form of public health \nintervention, based in the delivery of health services altogether with public welfare. This change \ntook place in 1943 when the DSP and the Office of Public Welfare were merged into the \nSecretar\u00eda de Asist encia Social [Ministry of Social Assistance].11 \n                                                             \n9 See Soto Laveaga, \"Bringing the Revolution to Medical Schools: Social Service and a Rural Health \nEmphasis in 1930s Mexico.\"  \n10 For C\u00e1rdenas public health policies see Carrillo, \"Salud p\u00fablica y poder durante el Cardenismo: \nM\u00e9xico, 1934 -1940.\"  \n11 See Ana Cecilia Rodr\u00edguez de Romo and Martha Eugenia Rodr\u00edguez P\u00e9rez, \"Historia de la salud \np\u00fablica en M\u00e9xico: siglos XIX y XX,\" Hist\u00f3ria, Ci\u00eancias, Sa\u00fade -Manguinhos  5.2 (1998).  304 \n The struggle to bring the original demands of the revolution back to the people as state \npolicies that actually reached both the disenfranchised in rural and urban settings and peasants \nand the working class, lasted two decades after the armed mobilizations ended in the late 1910s. \nDuring these decades, the Mexican state went through a transformation that established the \ninstitutions that would define Mexico in the second half of the 20th century. In the case o f health, \nthe 1917 constitutional recognition of health as a state\u2019s responsibility initiated a new era in the \ndelivery of Public Health and consequently of professional regulation in Mexico. It is not a \ncoincidence that historian Ana Mar\u00eda Carrilo\u2019s analy sis of the consolidation of the healing \nprofessions concludes in 1910 and public health specialist Julio Frenk\u2019s historical analysis of the \nmarket of professional medical services starts in 1917.12 I agree with them that such an arbitrary \ndelimitation is hi storigraphically convenient because it signals the end of the liberal state and the \nbeginning of the welfare state in Mexico and consequently the ideology behind the professional \norganization of physicians, the institutions around which they organized them selves, and the \nrelationship between these and the emergent state structure were significantly different. In other \nwords, Carrillo sees 1910 as the end point where professional medical institutions consolidated \nas clearly different from those of the coloni al period, and Frenk acknowledges that in 1917 the \nstructures that defined the Mexican medical profession during the 20th century began to \nconsolidate.  \nAs with many other periodizations, this one holds only if we pay attention to differences \nrather than similarities, to ruptures rather than continuities. In this dissertation, I stepped back \nfrom assuming that the triumphant liberalism of the second half of the 20th century and the \nconstruction of the revolutionary state defined two drastically different f orms of professional \n                                                             \n12 See Carrillo, \"Profesiones sanitarias y lu cha de poderes en el M\u00e9xico del siglo XIX.\" ; and Julio Frenk, \nH\u00e9ctor Hern\u00e1ndez -Llamas and Lourdes Alvarez -Klein, \"El mercado de trabajo m\u00e9dico.

Rather, I considered how the revolutionary state used both \nprofessional and state structures consolidated at the turn of the 20th century to train and regulate \nphysicians in the state\u2019s efforts to bring heal th to the population. The main structures that \ncontrolled the medical profession were not radically different. Indeed, by using the same \nstructures that regulated the profession in Mexico City during the Porfiriato , and consequently \neither the same medical  elites that ruled during this period, or their academic descendents, \nrevolutionary governments only transferred the policies of professional regulation that were \ntaking place in the capital to the rest of the nation. Consequently, the Superior Board of He alth \ntransformed into the Department of Public Health and the National School of Medicine hosted by \nthe National University of Mexico continued being the centers of professional control after 1917.  \nThe policies with which these institutions aimed to contr ol the profession were similar in both \nperiods. The ENM\u2019s medical curriculum aimed to serve as model of training that warranted \nhomogeneity in all medical schools and consequently of professional practice once students \ngraduated. The DSP aimed to use such training as the legal basis to regulate professional practice \nby means of a medical registry, a list of practitioners authorized by the state to practice medicine \nor other sanitary professions.  \nAs it happened in the rest of Latin America, the diversity of healers and the plurality of \nthe medical profession, as well as the threats that this heterogeneous population of practitioners \nrepresented to medical elites who wanted to marginalize their competitors, continued throughout \nthe first half of the 20th centu ry in Mexico.13 Midwifes, spiritual healers, traditional herbalists, \n                                                             \n13 Historians Ana Mar\u00eda Carrillo and Cl audia Agostoni have analyzed the plurality of the Mexican \nmedical profession in Carrillo, \"M\u00e9dicos del M\u00e9xico decimon\u00f3nico: entre el control estatal y la \nautonom\u00eda profesional.\" ; and Agostoni, \"M\u00e9dicos cient\u00edficos y m\u00e9dicos il\u00edcitos en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico \ndurante el Porfiriato.\"  For the preoccupations of the medical profession regarding other forms of healing \nin the mid -20th century see Everardo Landa, \"Espiritualismo y medicina,\" Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica  65.septiembre \n(1941). ; \"Charlataneria,\" Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica  44.octubr e (1939). ; \"Charlataner\u00eda,\" Acci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica  306 \n and curanderos were all an important component of the large group of practitioners who offered \nhealing services during the 19th century and that persisted throughout the first half of the 20th \ncentury, regardless of the efforts of the medical profession to monopolize the delivery of health \ncare. 14 As other historians have shown for other Latin American countries, in Mexico the growth \nof a state apparatus to deal with public health matters a ll over the nation and which ENM \ngraduates used to first control medical practice and later regulate medical training did not prevent \ntraditional and other type of healers \u2014 or even physicians with approaches who opposed those \nendorsed by the ENM \u2014 from po pulating the Mexican medical marketplace. Homeopaths, their \ninstitutions, and their ambiguous position within the Mexican medical profession and within \nstate institutions exemplify this trend.  \nHowever, by emphasizing the continuities between the late 19th and the early 20th \ncenturies I do not mean that the institutions that consolidated the Mexican medical profession did \nnot change throughout this period. Highlighting the continuities within Mexican medical \ninstitutions and their changing relationship to th e revolutionary state allows me to show that the \nconsolidation of the profession did not end in 1910 from whence it followed a progressive \nevolution towards the medical and state institutions that characterized the second half of the 20th \ncentury. Rather, the 1920s, 30s and early 40s were tortuous years where tradition and modernity, \nlay and specialized knowledge, liberalism and positivism, private and public welfare, and social \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n45.noviembre (1939). ; and Pruneda, \"La supercher\u00eda m\u00e9dica en el folklore.\"  For Latinamerica see Palmer, \nFrom Popular Medicine to Medical Populism : Doctors, Healers, and Public Power in Costa Rica, 1800 -\n1940 ., particularly chapters 4 -6; Sowell, The Tale of Healer Miguel Perdomo Neira: Medicine, \nIdeologies, and Power in the Nineteenth -Century Andes ., specially chapter 4.  \n14 Carrillo, \"Nacimiento y muerte de una profesion.

The elitist aspirations of ENM graduates, which the DSP employed to \ncontain epidemic disease all over the nation, i ncluding the \u201cthe fifth plague\u201d or the irregular \npractice of medicine in the 1920s, clashed with politicians and government officers who \nsupported the popularization of the university and private efforts to offer professional training, a \nconflict that favo red homeopaths. In the 1930s, C\u00e1rdenas\u2019 social and economic policy and \ncentralization of government subsumed ENM graduates\u2019 professional aspirations to the needs of \nthe population; hence his call to \u201csocialize the professions\u201d. In this process, the state s ustained its \nsupport to homeopathy.  \nWhat does this persistent support to a medical system which most regular doctors \nregarded as unscientific tell us about the professional organization of physicians in Mexico? \nWhat does it tell us about the relationship of the state to the Mexican medical profession? What \ndoes it tell us about the social spaces conquered by biomedicine both in medical institutions and \namongst the population in Mexico? What does it tell us about the institutionalization of public \nhealth in  the formation of a post -revolutionary state? And finally what does it tell us about the \ncontradictory state policies regarding the health of the population and the regulation of the \nprofession at one time and the way in which these changed through time? H istorians of medicine \nhave insisted that the framing of otherness in medical practice speaks more to the socio -political \nposition of a particular group of medical practitioners rather than to a substantial difference \nbetween certain unorthodox medical syst ems with their own ontologies and the systems that \ngrouped around positivistic medicine in the 19th century and later around what has been labeled 308 \n as biomedicine.15 For this reason, Charles Rosenberg says that \u201cAlternative medicine is [\u2026] an \nindex to the social and cultural geography of regular medicine\u201d.16 In this vein I have attempted in \nthis dissertation to step back from the theoretical discussions about the valid ity or not of \nhomeopathy as an effective medical system. Rather I have paid attention to understanding how \nthe characteristics of the system helped their practitioners deliver healing services in specific \nsocial settings and from there position themselves as professional competitors of regular doctors. \nIn other words, what matters to me is how the experts\u2019 discussions about the nature of medical \nscience and the competing medical systems such as homeopathy is an instantiation of larger \nsocial disputes regard ing practitioners\u2019 mobility in the social ladder, professional reputation, \nrevenues that resulted from private or public professional practice, the allocation of state \nresources, among others. In this sense, the disputes between the regular profession and \nhomeopaths in Mexico opened a window to explore the place of health in the broad Porfirian \nand post -revolutionary society, including patients, practitioners, and the state.  \nHomeopathy\u2019s arrival and early development in 19th \u2013century Mexico resembles the o ne \nit went through in England and the United States, where homeopathy though an unorthodox \nmedical system was originally practice in the realm of regular medicine and was only later \nmarginalized as medical deviance.17 In the latter countries, where politica l, economic and \n                                                             \n15 See for instance the analysis of quackery as a social construction and the slippery definition of fringes \nbetween orthodox and unorthodox practitioners in 18th century Britain in Bynum and Porter, eds., Medical \nFringe & Medical Orthodoxy, 1750 -1850   1-4. Roger Cooter questions the validity of the dichotomy \ncreated by regarding 19th-century heterodox medical practices as having alternative cosmologies. See \nCooter , \"Alternative Medicine, Alternative Cosmology.\"   \n16 Charles E. Rosenberg, Our Present Complaint : American Medicine, Then and Now  (Baltimore: Johns \nHopkins University Press, 2007) 130.  \n17 Perhaps the main monograph on the history of homeopathy in England wa s written by Nicholls, \nHomoeopathy and the Medical Profession . There are two authors who have extensively written about \nhomeopathy in the United States, Kaufman, Homeopathy in America; the Rise and Fall of a Medical \nHeresy .; and Haller, The History of Amer ican Homeopathy: the Academic Years, 1820 -1935 ., Haller, \nThe History of American Homeopathy: From Rational Medicine to Holistic Health Care . 309 \n consequently professional egalitarianism prevailed during the first half of the century, \nhomeopathy was only another of the multiple healing systems that proliferated in this period and \nthat both university -trained physicians and lay practi tioners used to satisfy patients and find a \nplace in the competitive medical marketplace.18 But in contrast to practitioners of other healing \nsystems of the period, homeopaths emulated the professional organization of university -trained \nphysicians, establis hing medical schools, opening hospitals, creating professional societies, and \npublishing medical journals. Perceiving that their social authority was challenged, orthodox \nphysicians reacted by formulating strict rules of allegiance, such as the 1858 Britis h Medical Act \npushed by the British Medical Association and the exclusionary act of the American Medical \nAssociation, that aimed to monopolize training and practice under the direction of a single \nprofessional organization. While these measures hardly erad icated homeopathy from England \nand the U. S., they placed orthodox physicians on the right track to consolidate as a profession \nduring the second half of the 19th and the early 20th century and marginalized other healing \nmethods such as homeopathy.  \nSimila rly, in Mexico, where liberalism and laissez faire predominated as political and \neconomic philosophies, university physicians and sanitary authorities regarded doctors who \npracticed homeopathy as members of the profession as long as they had the appropriat e \ncredentials and fulfilled the sanitary board\u2019s regulations. Amidst struggles and wars to make \nliberalism a national political and economic philosophy and federalism a form of government, \nMexican physicians were also struggling to transform colonial medic al institutions that regulated \ntheir professional life into modern ones that fit a modern liberal republic. Consequently, \nsubscribing to the state\u2019s regulatory institutions was more important to the medical community \n                                                             \n18 For an example of such a diversity see Gevitz, Other Healers: Unorthodox Medicine in America .; \nWhorton, Nature Cures : the History of Alternative Medicine in America .; Bynum and Porter, eds., \nMedical Fringe & Medical Orthodoxy, 1750 -1850 .; and Bivins, Alternative Medicine? : a History . 310 \n than doctrinarian deviance, though the distinction of practicing homeopathy remained in place. \nWhen the political and social stability was achieved by the late 1870s and Porfirio D\u00edaz\u2019s \nbrought social and political rest as well as economic progress to the nation for almost four \ndecades, orthodo x physicians consolidated around state institutions, monopolizing the medical \nschool, the sanitary board and welfare hospitals. Both orthodox physicians and homeopaths also \nestablished long -lasting professional societies and journals. Homeopaths\u2019 societies  in Mexico \nwere initially integrated by lay practitioners and university -trained physicians, but orthodox \nphysicians\u2019 privileged positions helped them impose the university degree as the symbol of \nprofessional distinction and the requirement for employment  at government institutions or for \nissuing official government documents such as death certificates. With the aim to fulfill the \nrequirements to belong to the profession and participate of regulated public life, homeopathic \nphysicians exscinded from the ho meopathic society and created their own. Mirroring the social \nstratification that the Porifiriato generated, the professional distinction between university -\ntrained physicians and practitioners who either received some training at homeopathic societies \nor self-trained using manuals of domestic medicine established a hierarchy within the medical \nprofession that eventually the Porfirian government institutionalized. In the face of a community \nof homeopathic physicians who promoted the scientific basis and sup eriority of homeopathy over \nits rivals, a healing system widely practiced by people who lacked adequate medical training, and \na population that searched for the services of mostly irregular homeopathic practitioners, Porifrio \nD\u00edaz\u2019s government decided to s upport a homeopathic hospital and a school. The decision \nelevated homeopathy to the rank of a profession in Mexico, giving them institutions where they \nreceived medical training and practice their own healing system, as well as credentials to \nparticipate o f the privileges that their orthodox peers enjoyed.  311 \n The regularization of homeopathy during this period is ambiguous. It can be interpreted \nas a despotic decision typical of the Porfirian regime, particularly because it responded to the \nrequests of homeop aths who had close ties with or had family bonds to economic elites, and to \nthe interests of his ministry of the interior \u2014 and also Diaz\u2019s father -in-law \u2014 without consulting \nthe school of medicine\u2019s faculty or members of the sanitary board. It can also be  interpreted as an \nextension of the reforms to modernize and regulate Mexican institutions, including the medical \nprofession. In this sense, homeopathy\u2019s regulation was an effort from the government elites to \nsocial elites. A third way to interpret this ou tcome is as a populist effort to provide medical \ntraining and healing services to the working class through welfare institutions. The model for the \nprovision of health to the destitute shifted during the 19th century from mostly Catholic charity \ninstitutio ns to a state responsibility in the form of welfare.19 While not being a policy of primary \ninterest, officials during the Porfiriato carried out a series of reforms to modernize welfare \ninstitutions to attend the medical, educational and labor needs of the poor. In this context, the \ncreation of the homeopathic hospital and school appear as an effort of elite physicians to \nimplement a healing system that to the standards of the late 19th century proved to be as or \nperhaps even more effective than regular ther apeutics. Given the nature of the large majority of \nhomeopathic practitioners and the apparent high demand amidst the working class, homeopathy \nseemed a good target for Porifirean welfare reforms. The ambiguous nature to regulate \nhomeopathic training and p ractice continued throughout the 1920s and 30s and played a key role \nin transforming and regulating the institutions of homeopathic training during this period. \nHowever, the nature of homeopathy as an option to offer medical training to the working class \n                                                             \n19 Virginia Aguirre Arv\u00edzu, Isaac Garc\u00eda Venegas, A\u00edda Valero Ch\u00e1vez and Social E scuela Nacional de \nTrabajo, De la caridad a la beneficencia p\u00fablica en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico, 1521 -1910  ([Mexico]: \nUniversidad Nacional Autonoma de M\u00e9xico, Escuela Nacional de Trabajo Social, 2002). ; Ann Shelby \nBlum, \"Conspicuous Benevolence: Liberalism, Pub lic Welfare, and Private Charity in Porfirian Mexico \nCity, 1877 -1910,\" The Americas  58.1 (2001).  312 \n along with the social and political changes initiated by the armed mobilization of the 1910s in the \nwhole nation, and particularly in urban centers such as Mexico City and Puebla, fueled the \npolitical activism of the lower ranks of the profession who having  limited access to elite medical \nschools actively protested for the recognition of the schools \u2014 most of them homeopathic \u2014 \nwhere they studied.  \nThe institutionalization of Mexican homeopathy seems to be exceptional only if \ncontrasted specifically to the f ormation of the medical profession in industrialized countries such \nas England and the U.S. and in other Latin American nations. In the first case, Mexican \nhomeopathy achieved what English and American homeopaths could not. Rather than being \nmarginalized b y the orthodox medical profession, Mexican homeopaths received state support \nand placed themselves vis -\u00e0-vis the orthodox Mexican medical profession, as elite physicians \nwith a state funded school and hospital and most importantly with a degree that acknow ledged \nthe regular status. Latin American nations, in the second case, developed strong medical \nprofessions by the end of the 19th century and homeopathy took hold through literate patients, \npharmacists and physicians.20 However, the efforts of homeopaths i n other Latin American \nnations to assault the medical profession were not successful. Steven Palmer\u2019s analysis of \nhomeopathy in Costa Rica suggests that the cause lies in a late arrival of homeopathy to this \ncountry combined with an already developed profe ssion.21 And Sowell\u2019s analysis of healer \nMiguel Perdomo Neira suggests that the close association between orthodox physicians and the \n                                                             \n20 For analyses on the development on the medical profession in Latin American countries see Palmer, \nFrom Popular Medicine to Medical Populism : Doctors, Healers, and Public Power in Costa Rica, 1800 -\n1940 .; Sowell, The Tale of Healer Miguel Perdomo Neira: Medicine, Ideologies, and Power in the \nNineteenth -Century Andes .; Zulawski, Unequal Cures: Public Health and Political Change in Bolivia, \n1900 -1950 ., part icularly chapters 1 and 2; Emilio Quevedo and Francisco Guti\u00e9rrez, \"Scientific Medicine \nand Public Health in Nineteenth -century Latin America,\" Science in Latin America.

In this case, the relevance of homeopathy as a medical system \nthat accommodated the health needs of the marginalized, of i ts institutions as suitable to bring \nmedical training and consequently social mobility to the working class, and the politics \nassociated to its practice as means to resist those in power appear to be the same across countries. \nFor instance, while in the U.  S. orthodox physicians imposed clear gendered roles within the \nprofession, which in turn impacted on women\u2019s professional and personal lives, homeopathy\u2019s \nirregular status allowed women\u2019s free expression of their political activism (usually in relation to  \nfeminism, suffrage, dress codes and health reform) in the mid -19th century and blurred the \ngender distinction that disqualified their entrance to the orthodox medical profession.23 By the \nend of the century, the incorporation of women to homeopathy helped to \u201crecast the physician \nfrom a medically educated male to a practitioner of either sex, shifting debates away from gender \ntoward proper education and practice.\"24 In colonial India, homeopathy was adopted by lay \npractitioners and physicians because its dis tribution as a modern medical commodity fit the \nneeds of an emerging class of \u201c bhadralok (or \u2018respectable people\u2019)\u201d; its charitable institutions \n                                                             \n22 See Sowell, The Tale of Healer Miguel Perdomo Neira: Medicine, Ideologies, and Power in the \nNineteenth -Century Andes   48-50.; for Argentina s ee Mg.

The nature of homeo pathy as a symptom -based healing system \nthat uses harmless medications made and continues making it suitable to be used by a population \nwith minimal or no training in medical science. In the 19th century, when orthodox physicians \nwere using specialized sci entific medical knowledge as a means to detach from other healing \npractices, gain authority over patients, and uplift the profession, the commercialization of \nhomeopathy as a scientific healing system that any literate citizen could use and more \nimportantl y practice threatened the monopolistic efforts of orthodox physicians. However, \nhomeopathy was not for everyone. Only literate citizens had access to it. In Mexico where elites \nconstituted a minority who were literate not only in Spanish but sometimes also  in French and \n                                                             \n25 Bivins, Alternative Medicine? : a History   152-8. \n26 See Palmer, From Popular Medicine to Medical Populism : Doctors, Healers, and Public Power in \nCosta Rica, 1800 -1940   185-91.; Sowell, The Tale of Healer Miguel Perdomo Neira: Medicine, \nIdeologies, and Power in the Nineteenth -Century Andes   57-8. 315 \n increasingly in the 19th century in English and the mostly illiterate indigenous population \nconstituted the large majority, this implied that homeopathy could only be learned and practiced \nby elites. With the growth that the working class ex perienced during the Porfiriato  particularly in \nurban centers and the incipient but to offer basic and vocational training to workers through \nwelfare institutions, this trend started to change at the turn of the century. Some physicians as \nwell as lawyers,  teachers, and pharmaceutical entrepreneurs, to mention just a few among the \nemergent working class, started to practice homeopathy and organize their professional societies. \nBut the state enforcement of measures aimed to regulate medical training and prac tice obliged \nhomeopaths to divide their societies according to the nature of the practitioners who integrated \nthem, in other words into societies of homeopathic doctors and lay practitioners, perpetuating the \nsocial divide between elites and the working cl ass, professional physicians and lay practitioners, \nmedical doctors and charlatans. It was this division the one that allowed homeopathic physicians \nto obtain the state support to open a hospital that eventually hosted a homeopathic medical \nschool. Rather than ruling out the competitors of the orthodox medical profession, the state \nintervention embraced homeopathy as a need to bring professional homeopaths to the large \nnumber of patients who demanded their services but could mostly find untrained practition ers. In \nother words, the response of the Mexican state to the pluralism within the profession symbolized \nby homeopathy and to the popular demands of such pluralism was to institutionalize such \ndiversity by regularizing homeopathy.27  \nThis solution was ambivalent. In the short turn, the state supported homeopathic medical \nschool did not fulfill the purpose for which it was opened because only social elites had access to \n                                                             \n27 For an analysis of how different forms of state intervention influence the outcome in the \nprofessionalization of physicians in Mexico in contrast to industrializ ed nations such as the US and \nEngland see Nigenda and Solorzano, \"Doctors and Corporatist Politics: the Case of the Mexican Medical \nProfession.\"  316 \n it through the 1920s, leaving space for others, mainly medical entr epreneurs in the 1910s and 20s \nand eventually the state, to solve the problem of offering medical training to the working class. \nIn the long run, the efforts to centralize government during the 1930s in an effort to fulfill the \ndemands of the revolution re sumed the project of a state -sponsored homeopathic school that \nbrought medical training to the working class. The reconstruction of the Mexican state in \nresponse to the social demands of the revolution in the 1920s and 30s was not an easy task and \nresulted  in the reformulation of the conflict between the mainstream medical profession and \nhomeopaths. On one side, governments after the armed mobilizations of the 1910s confirmed the \nformer hegemonic position of most of the Porfirian institutions within the new  bureaucratic \norganization, including the ones that the medical profession controlled, such as the ENM and the \nnew DSP. This could not be otherwise since revolutionary governments could not organize a \nnation from scratch. On the other, reformers such as Jo s\u00e9 Vasconcelos in the 1920s and L\u00e1zaro \nC\u00e1rdenas in the 1930s, both of whom had an educational agenda that contrasted with the one \nendorsed by elite professionals, struggled to transform state institutions to bring education to the \npopulation at large, into  institutions that educated not only those who had the means to afford \neducation but to all the nation. Their policies resulted in the eventual detachment of the national \nuniversity as a state institution and the creation of a polytechnic institute and oth er structures to \nregulate professional training and licensing. Both structural changes, in turn, used homeopathic \nmedical schools as options to provide medical training to the working class.  \nAs in the case of women in American homeopathy, in Mexico the in ternal division \nbetween progressive and traditional homeopaths, distinguished by their willingness or not to \nincorporate scientific breakthroughs into their corpus and adopt modern medical technologies, 317 \n overlapped over class and professional distinctions.28 Regardless of state support whether during \nthe Porfiriato  or in the 1920s, the homeopathic school did not thrive during these decades, \nperhaps because elites preferred to enroll at the ENM than at the ENMH as a consequence of the \nstatus of homeopathy as m arginal within the Mexican medical profession, because class \nschedules did not fit the needs of the population to whom originally this medical training was \naddressed, or because the support to the school ended once its original sponsor died. Moreover, \nelite homeopathic physicians who headed or taught at the ENMH did not strive to attract a larger \npool of students to the school or make the later endure in front of the attacks of university \nphysicians. While there were attempts to improve the material conditi ons of the school, the social \nand professional position of these homeopaths made them prone to seek state support without \nquestioning its decisions. This attitude helped them subsist as a small and marginalized group of \nregular homeopathic physicians in th e 1900 and 10s. However, amongst these, those who \nendorsed traditional/orthodox/pure homeopathy found venues to offer medical training to the \nworking class at the margins of state regulations through proprietary \u2014 or free, as they were \nlabeled in the Mexic an context \u2014 medical schools. Aligning with the ethos of political \norganization that the working class experienced after the violent years of the 1910s in Mexico \nCity, graduates from these schools in general, but particularly form the ELHM, used homeopathy  \nas an ideology and their school as their headquarters to resist the efforts of the medical \n                                                             \n28 Anne Taylor Kirschman identifies that classic/traditionalist homeopaths usually used high potencies \nwere supp orted by lay practitioners, were more sectarian, endorsed vitalism, had a tendency to use \nmetaphysical explanations of disease and more importantly were the responsible for the survival of \nhomeopathy in the 20th century. See Kirschmann, A Vital Force: Women in American Homeopathy ., \nparticular chapter 1. For the survival of homeopathy as a system that largely relied on metaphysical \nexplanations of disease see Haller, The History of American Homeopathy: From Rational Medicine to \nHolistic He alth Care . 318 \n profession which used the DSP and the new sanitary regulation to ban the irregular practice of \nmedicine all over the nation, in general, and of these schools and th eir graduates, in particular.29  \nNigenda and Sol\u00f3rzano argue that the corporatist nature of the Mexican state modeled the \nnational medical profession.30 Broadly considered, my dissertation suggests that the \ninstitutionalization of homeopathy is one example o f how state policies defined the organization \nof the Mexican medical profession, decentralizing professional power and redistributing it \namongst different groups within the profession, such as homeopaths. However, my dissertation \nshows that the way to the hegemonic state control over the medical profession was not a \nstraightforward process and that homeopaths were a key group used by the state to undermine \nuniversity physicians\u2019 political control. While mentioning the role of university -trained \nphysicians i n the new DSP, Nigenda and Sol\u00f3rzano disregarded their role in using their new \nposition within this office and the UNM to unify medical training and practice across the nation. \nMy dissertation shows that the disputes between the Mexican state and medical p rofession about \nthe control of medical training and licensing took place between the institutions governed by \nuniversity -trained physicians and the SEP, controlled by revolutionary governments. In this \ncontested negotiation of political and professional po wer the state used homeopathic medical \nschools as a counterbalancing element within the medical profession. By supporting these \nschools, the state symbolically and economically undermined the privileged position of \nuniversity physicians, and by retaining t he control over professional medical training beyond \n                                                             \n29 For the political organization of the working class in Mexico City see Lear, Workers, Neighbors, and \nCitizens: the Revolution in Mexico City . \n30 In other words, that the way the state organized its health policies that in turn defined academic \ncurricula in and budget for medical schools, the organization of professional associations around political \nparties, the approach to medical practice, and the creation of public health institutions. Nigenda and \nSolorzano, \"Doctors and Corporatist Politics:  the Case of the Mexican Medical Profession,\" 76 -80. For a \nsimilar analysis of the role of the state in the development of professional organization in Mexico see \nCleaves, Professions and the State: the Mexican Case . 319 \n UNAM and over medical licensing, the state shared the control of professional medical training \nduring the period of liberal medicine in Mexico.31  \nThe organization of the Mexican medical working class around homeopathy developed as \na form of resistance to sanitary measures that aimed to regulate medical degrees and licenses. \nThe ambivalent role of the state is evident through the analysis of such resistance. On one level, \nthe state aimed to impose publi c health measures all over the nation to fulfill the constitutional \nmandate to make health a priority amongst the population. By framing the liberal practice of \nmedicine in general, and homeopathy and its practitioners in particular, as the fifth plague, a n \nepidemic disease which was necessary to attack, university physicians aligned with the state\u2019s \npublic health policies. Consequently, the President in turn usually supported actions taken by \nsanitary authorities to implement and even enforce the medical r egistry and homeopaths\u2019 \nresistance rarely had any impact on these regulations, which aimed to ban homeopaths\u2019 training \nand practice. However, homeopaths\u2019 demands resonated with the state\u2019s educational policies. It \nwas through theses and the institutions re sponsible to regulate implement them that the state \nsupported homeopathy, as a currency of exchange in the state\u2019s struggle to control the medical \nprofession. In this sense, the effectiveness of homeopathic resistance was subjected to the needs \nof the stat e, leaving them almost no space for political action. Such political exchanges and \ndynamics settle down the professional structures that characterized the homeopathic profession \nthroughout the second half of the 20th century.  \n                                                             \n31 While Nigenda and Sol\u00f3rzano identify the liberal period from 1917 to 1944, I would argue with Hale \nthat the ideologies behind the regulations, as well as the government institutions responsible to implement \nthem, of the medical profession, were initiated in the mid -19th century, initially imp lemented during the \nPorfiriato , interrupted by the armed conflict of the 1910s and reformulated during the 1920s and 30s. \nOnly in the 1940s onwards, it is possible to identify a stable structural organization of the medical \nprofession and health services t hat distinguished Mexican medicine during the second half of the 20th \ncentury. Hale, The Transformation of Liberalism in Late Nineteenth -Century Mexico . 320 \n The chapter structure of the dissertation suggests that homeopathy was introduced in the \nmid-19th century, institutionalized in the Porfiriato , and controlled by sanitary authorities in the \nearly 1930s, as if homeopathy\u2019s historical development within medical institutions in Mexico \nfollowed a normal pattern, flourishing during the late 19th century and fading out during the early \n20th century with the triumph of biomedicine. This pattern for the development of homeopathy \nhas been described for other countries such as England and the Un ited States. In contrast to these \ncountries, homeopathy flourished during the second half of the 19th century in Mexico, became a \nregular profession at the turn of the century, and persisted as an important political component in \nthe structuring of the med ical profession throughout the first four decades of the 20th century. \nWhy were homeopaths able to defend and sustain such a position within the medical profession \nin Mexico when their professional peers could not in other countries? The answer lies in \nhomeopaths\u2019 ability as a group of medical practitioners to navigate the elusive boundary between \nprofessional and domestic medicine, between regulated and unregulated medical practice, and \nthe role of the state in the configuration of the Mexican medical prof ession. Particularly, \nhomeopathy thrived as a parallel medical system during 20th century Mexico for several \nreasons.32 First, homeopathy\u2019s doctrinarian corpus was flexible enough to accommodate new \nways of understanding medical science while preserving its particular understandings of the body \nand therapeutics. Mexican homeopathic physicians and domestic healers embraced homeopathy \n                                                             \n32 Clauding Herzlich argues that the approach to study medical systems and forms of healing that differ \nfrom biomedicine as alternative medicine is misleading, particularly in countries where such systems have \nbeen historically present such as in France. She proposes the conceptualization of these practices as \n\u201cm\u00e9dicines paralleles\u201d whose \u201cconstant distance\u201d  with mainstream medicine varies through time and in \nresponse to social, political, cultural and economic factors. Claudine Herzlich, \"Patients, Practitioners, \nSocial Scientists and the Multiple Logics of Caring and Healing,\" Historical Aspects of Unconventional \nMedicine. Approaches, Conceptas, Case Studies , eds. Robert J\u00fctte, Motzi Ekl\u00f6f and Marie C. Nelson \n(Sheffield, UK: European Association for the History of Medicine and Health, 2001).  \n \n 321 \n because it aligned with their own particular understandings of health, disease and medicine \nwhether be it modern/scientific or traditional/domestic. Following the regulatory policies that \ncharacterized the medical profession but responding to th e social needs of the urban working \nclass, homeopathic physicians opened medical schools where they offered an up -to-date medical \ncurriculum to train urban domestic healers. Second, responding to the social sensibilities and the \nstructural changes that too k place after 1917, homeopaths used their medical schools as centers \nof political and professional organization and homeopathy as an ideology that congregated the \nmedical working class. With this professional and labor identity, homeopaths resisted univers ity \nphysicians\u2019 educational and sanitary regulatory policies aimed to ban homeopathic medical \ndegrees and licenses. And third, responding to the social demands that resulted from the \nrevolution, the Mexican state persistently supported homeopathic medical schools as a means to \nfulfill the demands of the working class for professional medical training, undermine the power \nof university physicians and retain the control of the medical profession.  \n 322 \n Acronyms used in the m ain text and notes  \nInstitutions  \nIHM    Instituto Homeop\u00e1tico Mexicano  \nENM    Escuela Nacional de Medicina  \nENMH    Escuela Nacional de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica  \nELHM    Escuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda de M\u00e9xico  \nDSP   Departamento de Salubridad P\u00fablica  \nSEP   Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica  \nUNM    Universidad Nacional de M\u00e9xico (1910 \u20131933)  \nUNAM    Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (1933 \u2013 ) \nELMP    Escuela Libre de Medicina de Puebla  \nSCJN    Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Naci\u00f3n  \n \nArchives  \nAHSS     Archivo Historico de la Secretar\u00eda de Salud  \n SP   Salubridad P\u00fablica  \n  P  Presidencia  \n   S Secretar\u00eda  \n  SJ  Servicio Jur\u00eddico  \n  EM  Ejercicio de la Medicina  \n BP   Beneficencia p\u00fablica  \n  EH  Establecimientos hospitalarios  \n   HNH  Hospital Nacional Homeop\u00e1tico  \n SSA   Secretar\u00eda de Salubridad y Asistencia  \n  DGAJ   Direcci\u00f3n General de Asuntos Jur\u00eddicos  323 \n AHUNAM    Archivo Hist\u00f3rico de la Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de \nM\u00e9xico  \n EACh    Ezequiel Adeato Ch\u00e1vez  \n ENAE    Escuela Nacional de Altos Estudios  \n UN   Fondo Universidad Nacional  \n  R   Rector\u00eda  \n   DU Departam ento Universitario  \n CU   Consejo Universitario 1910 \u20131930  \n ENM    Escuela Nacional de Medicina  \n  ENMH   Escuela Nacional de Medicina Homeop\u00e1tica  \nAHELHM    Archivo Hist\u00f3rico de la Escuela Libre de Homeopat\u00eda de M\u00e9xico  \nAHENM    Archivo Hist\u00f3rico de la Escuela Nac ional de Medicina  \n CSS   Consejo Superior de Salubridad  \n ENMyA   Escuela Nacional de Medicina y Alumnos  \nAGN     Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n  \n OC   Obreg\u00f3n -Calles  \nPOR    Pascual Ortiz Rubio  \n ALR    Abelardo L.
