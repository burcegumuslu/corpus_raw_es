It\u2019s safe and it doesn't have any effect on androgen hormones, it does not affect\nhormone levels in the blood. But 7-keto declines with age. 7- keto as a supplement can greatly improve fat\nloss, build muscle, increase thyroid gland activity, boost the immune system, improve memory and reduce the\nsigns of aging. It isn\u2019t a stimulant and doesn\u2019t cause jitters or heart palpitations, but improves\ncalorie-burning ability at the most basic level, by increasing resting metabolic rate.\nIt\u2019s one of the safest fat loss supplements you can take.\nDandelion are a family of flowering plants that grow in many parts of the world. One of its main benefits is that it is an excellent natural and safe diuretic, it helps to decrease fluid retention. It also has the ability to improve carbohydrate metabolism and reduce fat absorption. Is an excellent source of vitamins A, C and K. They also contain vitamin E, folate and small amounts of other B vitamins. What\u2019s more, dandelion greens provide a substantial amount of several minerals, including iron, calcium, magnesium and potassium. Dandelion contain high levels of the antioxidant beta-carotene, which is known to provide strong protection against cellular damage and oxidative stress. Dandelion may be also effective in reducing inflammation caused by disease due to the presence of various bioactive compounds like polyphenols within the plant.\nPegged as the \u201cherb of longevity,\u201d gotu kola is a staple in traditional Chinese, Indonesian, and Ayurvedic medicine, it has many benefits. The plant\u2019s benefits range from greatly improving memory and restoring brain cell and nerve function to improving blood quality and circulation, restoring digestion and speeding the healing of wounds. The main reason we added Gotu Kola (Pennywort or Centella asiatica) is because it increases collagen growth, it has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and it also improves circulation, as a result you could reduce cellulite and prevent stretch marks.\nDiindolylmethane (DIM) is a super healthy compound in cruciferous vegetables. You would have to eat a giant serving bowl of broccoli and cabbage to get the researched dose of DIM necessary for overall health. It helps to prevent testosterone aromatization and it laso helps your body get rid of Xenoestrogens. Your body will continue to produce the estrogen it would have produced without DIM. Xenoestrogens (estrogen imitators from your personal and household products and environment) still make their way inside your body as they would without DIM. More accurately, DIM works two ways. First, it blocks the enzyme (aromatasa) that converts testosterone into estrogen. Second, it converts bad estrogens into good estrogen metabolites. A lot of women and a substantial portion of men are either aware or suspect they are estrogen dominant \u2014 they have too much estrogen relative to other hormones. This affects their body composition and overall health. DIM helps to balance estrogen. Bad estrogens signal to your body to hold onto weight, especially in the hips and thighs, if you have a better balance of estrogen metabolites, you\u2019re less likely to hold onto unnecessary body fat. DIM and its precursor I3C also could suppress adipogenesis, which is the formation of new fat cells. It also stimulates fat burning.\nGreen tea is one of the healthiest herbs on the planet. It is loaded with antioxidants and nutrients that have powerful effects on the body. These include improved brain function, fat loss, a strong antioxidant properties. Green tea is loaded with polyphenol antioxidants, including a catechin called EGCG. These antioxidants can have various beneficial effects on health. Green tea contains less caffeine than coffee, but enough to produce an effect. It also contains the amino acid L-theanine, which can work synergistically with caffeine to improve brain function. Green tea has also been shown to boost the metabolic rate and increase fat burning in the short term.\nUva ursi is a herb commonly referred to as bearberry, because bears enjoy eating the plant\u2019s fruit. For natural health purposes, however, only the leaves, not the berries, are used in herbal medicine. Uva ursi contains a compound called arbutin, a glycosylated hydroquinone, which has the ability to drain excess water from cells, promoting an antiseptic effect on the kidneys. During its excretion, arbutin produces an antiseptic effect on the urinary mucous membrane and can therefore help assist with the urinary tract infections. Uva ursi also contains diuretic chemicals, including ursolic acid, powerful astringents, and a chemical, allantoin, that helps promote the growth of healthy new cells and the healing of wounds. It also contains tannic acid, a phenolic acid, which is also found in nettles, tea, and berries. Studies have shown that tannic acid has a number of health benefits including anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory.\nL-theanine is an amino acid found most commonly in tea leaves and in small amounts in Bay Bolete mushrooms. It can be found in both green and black tea. L-theanine promotes relaxation. It\u2019s a great natural ally against stress. L-theanine relieves anxiety in large part because it bears a close resemblance to the brain-signaling chemical glutamate. L-theanine produces the opposite effect in the brain. While glutamate is the brain\u2019s most important excitatory neurotransmitter, L-theanine binds to the same brain cell receptors and blocks them to glutamate\u2019s effects. This action produces inhibitory effects.That inhibition to brain overactivity has a calming, relaxing effect in which anxiety fades. L-theanine relieves stress without causing drowsiness or impairing motor behavior. In fact, studies show it improves alertness and attention. Researchers are now examining L-theanine\u2019s applications beyond its anti-anxiety effects. Studies suggest a role for L-theanine in supporting cognitive function and preventing cognitive loss by protecting brain cells.\nGinkgo biloba, or maidenhair, is a tree native to China that has been grown for thousands of years for a variety of uses. Ginkgo contains flavonoids and terpenoids, which are compounds known for their strong antioxidant effects, which fight the damaging effects of free radicals. It also has the ability to reduce inflammation caused by various conditions. This may be one of the reasons it has such broad health applications. Ginkgo can increase blood flow by promoting the dilation of blood vessels. Great circulation is important for health but it\u2019s also crucial if you want to reduce cellultite. It can also improve memory and mood. As a bonus we also included Vitamin C, a great antioxidant that may improve immune system, combat oxidative stress and also helps to increase collagen synthesis. Our capsules are 100% vegan made with chlorophyll. Chlorophyll plays an important role in making plants green and healthy.
