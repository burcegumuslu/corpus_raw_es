Food global demand is expected to double\nduring the first half of this century, becauseof the growing human population. Over the\nsame period, we are experiencing largeclimatechangeswhich impact on the resources\navailable for food production. As a result, concerns o n environmental impacts, animal\nwelfare and food security are emerging as important issues for animal production in\ndeveloping countries . Advances in animal science are essential for integrating information\nfrom new discoveries and techniques into practica l knowledge applicable to animal farm\nanditsproducts. Animal science can make a significant global contribution for resolving\nconflicts among stakeholder and for translating scientific knowledge into economic and\nsocial benefit.\nThe Ensminger Conferenc e \u201cAdvancing Modern Animal Production\u201d is being held at La\nMolina National Agrarian University, Peru, on November 5 -7, 2014, with the aim of\nbringing together animal scientists, industry representatives, consultants, and students to\nshare and discuss issue s directly influencing the future of animal production with focus on\nswine, poultry and cattle industry .This conference will feature current and future\nresearch that will shape the future of Animal Production in Latin America.\nThis conference will gather invited speakers and attendes from around the world and it\nwillprovide an opportunity for delegates to present posters with their latest research.\nFocal topics of the conference will be Animal Welfare, Genomics, Animal Biotechnology\nand Nutrition. Key outcomes expected are: (1) the exchange of updated information about\nemerging topics in animal science; (2) the sharing of visions for future impacts and\napplications of new technologies on animal production systems.

Ensminger Endowed Chair\nFacultad Zootecnia Department of Animal Science\nUniversidad Nacional Agraria La Molina Iowa State University4List of Contribut ors\nDr. Max Rothschild\nDr. Max Rothschild is a CF Curtiss Distinguished Professor in Agriculture and Life\nScience and holds the ME Ensminger Chair in International Animal Agriculture.\nRothschild received his B.S.at the University of California, Davis in 1974 and his M.S. at\nthe University of Wisconsin in 1975 and Ph.D. in animal breeding from Cornell\nUniversity in 1978. In 1980 he joined Iowa State University. From1993to 2013\nRothschild served as the USDA Pig Genome Mapping Coordinator. In 2007 he was\nnamed director of the Center for Integrated Animal Genomics. Rothschild also has\nbeen active developing livestock projects in developing countries and serves as\nassociate director for the Center for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods. In 2013,he was\nnamed Co -Director of the Global Food Security Consortium, a group of universities\nand research labs centered at Iowa State University. Rothschild has devoted his\nresearch and teaching career to the fields of animal breeding and molecular genetics\nand he and his lab have discovered a large number of individual genes associated with\ntraits of importance and many of these are used in selection in the commercial pig\nindustry. He is widely recognized as a world leader in the field of pig genetics. He is\npresently working with the genomics of 7 species including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs,\nchickens and farm raised shrimp. He has presented numerous invited papers in over\n50 countries and has over 35 0 referred publication s, 500 other publications and 12\npatents. His many awar ds include AAAS fellow, USDA Group Honor Award, Rockefeller\nPrentice award in Animal Breeding and Genetics ,the ASAS International Service\naward,ASAS fellow, two R&D100 awards and hewas named Iowa Inventor of the year\nin 2002.\nDr. Lance Baumgard\nLance is a native of southwest Minnesota who grew up on a swine and row -crop farm.\nHe has a B.S. and M.S. degree from the University of Minnesota and a PhD from Cornell\nUniversity.  He joined the University of Arizona faculty as an Assistant Professor in the\nFallof 2001 and was promoted to Associate Professor in Spring of 2007.  Baumgard\njoined Iowa State University in 2009 and is the Norman Jacobson Professor of\nNutritional Physiology in the Department of Animal Science.  Lance\u2019s early research\ncareer focused on efforts relating to milk fat synthesis regulation and to the\nmetabolism and energetics of the transition cow.  Since 2006, Baumgard\u2019s primary\nresearch emphasis has been on the metabolic and endocrine consequences of heat\nstress in both ruminant and monoga stric farm animals. Lance and his research team\nhave made a number of novel discoveries with regards to changes in carbohydrate,\nlipid and protein metabolism during heat stress.  These previously unexplained\nchanges in post -absorptive nutrient partitioning reduces milk yield more than what5the reduced feed intake and negative energy balance would predict.  At Iowa State\nUniversity, Lance\u2019s Environmental Physiology efforts have evaluated how heat stress\nalters post -absorptive fuel selection in growing pigs a nd many of the same metabolic\nchanges occurring in ruminants also occur in pigs.  His findings primarily explain why\nheat-stressed pigs accrue more lipid and less protein than energetically predicted.  He\nteaches Principals of Nutrition, and co -teaches Foo d Processing for Companion\nAnimals at the undergraduate level and teaches Bioenergetics and co -teaches\nAdvanced Ruminant Nutrition at the graduate level.  Lance has mentored or co -\nadvised 8 PhD and 15 MS students and all of them are currently successful in a variety\nof industry and academic positions. Lance has been the PI or co -PI on over $5.0\nmillion in research funding including 4 USDA grants. Lance and his group have\npublished 20 reviews and book chapters, 55 research articles, 140 abstracts, and 62\nconference proceedings and for regional meetings concentrating on industry relevant\nissues.

Ensminger Chair with consultation\nby the Chair of the Department of Animal Science. Dr. Max Rothschild was appointed\nEnsminger Chair since2007.The Ensminger Chair works with faculty and students to\noptimize activities and opportunities in the department and with scientists around the\nworld to develop international schools and conferences.11Activities\nSeveral activities are underway and can be viewed at\nhttp://www.ans.iastate.edu/section/Ensminger/. These activities include the\nfollowing: 1) International Ensminger schools; 2) Ensminger visiting\nfellows/scientists; 3) Sponsored seminars; 4) Travel and international activities in\nother countries; 5) Development of a class in international animal agriculture and 6)\nto continue development and publishing of books formerly published by Dr.\nEnsminger and coauthors.\nEnsminger Schools are designed to be conferences that are offered around the world to\nhelp train people of different regions in modern animal agriculture practices. The\nschools, about 3 every 5 years, consist of 12 -14 speakers of international stature and\nof which many are from Iowa St ate University. In addition ,speakers travel and learn\nabout the culture of the host country. This present Ensminger School will be heldin\nLimaat La Molina National Agrarian University in Peru.\nEnsminger visiting scientists are visitors that come and work in the department and\nseek some assistance from the Ensminger program. To date we have had several\nvisitors from the following countries: Uganda (1); South Africa (1); Italy (1); Korea (1),\nSpain(1)and the Philippines (3) .These people come for seve ral months or up to a\ncouple of years. Projects have included training in molecular biology, quantitative\ngenetics, meat science and animal science. One visitor from Uganda is a graduate\nstudent doing a MS and will be working on ideas to develop livestock production in\nUganda to help family sustainability.\nSeminars include sponsoring experts to come to Iowa State University. The program\nhas supported a series of seminars called \u201cFeeding the World are we making\nprogress\u201d and individual; seminar titles can b e seen at\nhttp://www.ans.iastate.edu/section/Ensminger/?pg=seminars. These seminars give\nISU students, staff and faculty opportunities to meet and hear interesting topics.\nTravel and International Activities have included considerable activities in Ugand a in\nthe Center for Sustainable Livelihoods and can be seen at\nhttp://www.srl.ag.iastate.edu/work/livestock/ . Other activities have included\nspeaking in Bulgaria, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Kore a, Kenya, Uganda, U.K. and other\nplaces. Other faculties have been partly supported to travel with student trips.\nInternational Animal Agriculture course has been taugth in the animal science\ndepartment at ISU. The course cover differences in animal agric ulture around the\nworld as well as topicslike sustainability, food production and environmental issues.\nOpportunities for the Future\nThe world is becoming a smaller place. The purpose of this program is to expand\nthose activities and to help faculty and students participate more internationally. All\ninterested parties are encouraged to visit with the Chair to discuss their ideas.\nSponsorship of activities both at ISU and international are open to consideration.121\nReduction of Heat Stress to Improve Production in\nCattle\nL.H. Baumgard1, M.K. Abuajamieh1, S.K. Stoakes1, and R.P. Rhoads2\n1Iowa State University,2Virginia Tech University\nSummary\nEnvironmental -induced hyperthermia compromises efficient animal production and\njeopardizes animal welfare. Reduced productive output during heat stress was\ntraditionally thought to result from decreased nutrient intake.  Our observations\nchallenge this dogma and indicate heat -stressed animals employ novel homeorhetic\nstrategies to direct metabolic and fuel selection p riorities independently of nutrient\nintake or energy balance. Thus, the heat stress response markedly alters post -\nabsorptive carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism independently of reduced feed\nintake through coordinated changes in fuel supply and util ization by multiple tissues.\nThere may be nutritional, pharmaceutical and managerial options to take advantage of\nthese aforementioned metabolic changes to improve productivity and animal welfare\nduring the warm summer months.\nResumen\nReducci\u00f3n del estr\u00e9 s cal\u00f3rico para mejor la producci\u00f3n en vacunos\nLa hipertermia inducida por el ambiente compromete la eficiencia de la producci\u00f3n\nanimal y pone en peligro el bienestar animal. La reducci\u00f3n de l rendimiento productivo\ndurante el estr\u00e9s por calor tradicionalm ente se pensaba que era resultado de la\ndisminuci\u00f3n de la ingesta de nutrientes. Nuestras observaciones cuestionan este\ndogmae indican que animales estresados por calor emplean estrategias de\nhomeostasis novedosas para dirigir las prioridades metab\u00f3licas y de selecci\u00f3n\nenerg\u00e9tica independientemente de la ingesta de nutrientes o el balance de energ\u00eda.\nPor lo tanto, la respuesta al estr\u00e9s de calor altera marcadamente el metabolismo post -\nabsorci\u00f3n de carbohidratos, l\u00edpidos y prote\u00ednas, independientemente de la reducci\u00f3n\nde la ingesta de alimentos a trav\u00e9s de cambios coordinados en el suministro\nenerg\u00e9tico y la utilizaci\u00f3n por dive rsos tejidos. Puede haber opciones nutricionales,\nfarmac\u00e9uticas y de manejo para aprovechar estos cambios metab\u00f3licos antes13mencionados para mejorar la productividad y el bienestar de los animales durante los\nmeses de verano.\nIntroduction\nThe term \u201cstress \u201d is defined in different ways, but is used to describe influences\noutside of a body system, which can shift the internal mechanisms away from their\nnormal or resting state (Lee, 1965).  Therefore, the term heat stress is used to\ndescribe the effects of in creasing environmental temperature on different\nphysiological systems.  This is of interest to the dairy industry because of the\ndetrimental changes (production, metabolic, reproductive) induced by heat stress\n(West, 2003; Bernabucci et al., 2005).\nHeat stress negatively impacts a variety of dairy parameters including milk yield, milk\nquality and composition, rumen health, growth and reproduction and therefore is a\nsignificant financial burden (~$900 million/year for dairy in the U.S.; St. Pierre et al.,\n2003).  Advances in management (i.e. cooling systems; Armstrong, 1994; VanBaale et\nal., 2005) and nutritional strategies (West, 2003) have alleviated some of the negative\nimpact of heat stress on cattle, but productivity continues to decline during the\nsummer.  In the upper Midwest, heat -induced poor reproduction may be the costliest\nissue.  For example, pregnancy rates at the Iowa State University Dairy decreased 19%\nduring the 2010 summer and did not return to spring levels until the middle of\nDecember.\nBiological Consequences of Heat Stress\nThe biological mechanism by which heat stress impacts production and reproduction\nis partly explained by reduced feed intake, but also includes altered endocrine status,\nreduction in rumination and nutrient absorption, and increased maintenance\nrequirements (Collier and Beede, 1985; Collier et al., 2005) resulting in a net decrease\nin nutrient/energy available for production.  This decrease in energy results in a\nreduction in energy balance (EBAL), and partially explain s (reduced gut fill also\ncontributes) why dairy cattle lose significant amounts of body weight when subjected\nto unabated heat stress (Rhoads et al., 2009; Shwartz et al., 2009; Wheelock et al.,\n2010).\nReductions in energy intake during heat stress results in a majority of dairy cows\nentering into negative energy balance (NEBAL) , regardless of the stage of lactation.\nEssentially, the heat -stressed cow enters a bioenergetic state similar (but not to the\nsame extent) to the NEBAL observed in early lactation. The NEBAL associated with\nthe early postpartum period is coupled with increased risk of metabolic disorders and\nhealth problems (Goff and Horst, 1997; Drackley, 1999), decreased milk yield and\nreduced reproductive performance (Lucy et al., 1992; Beam and Butler, 1999;\nBaumgard et al., 2002; 2006).  It is likely that many of the negative effects of heat14stress on production, animal health and reproduction indices are mediated by the\nreduction in EBAL (similar to the transition period).  However, it is not clear how\nmuch of the reduction in performance (milk yield and reproduction) can be attributed\nor accounted for by the biological parameters affected by heat stress (i.e. reduced feed\nintake vs. increased maintenance costs).\nRumen Health:\nThe heat -stressed cow is prone to rumen acidosis, and many of the lasting effects of\nwarm weather (laminitis, low milk fats etc.) can probably be traced back to a low\nrumen pH during the summer months.  This may be explained by increased\nrespiration rate which results i n enhanced carbon dioxide ( CO2) exhalation.  In order\nto be an effective blood pH buffering system, the body needs to maintain 20:1\nbicarbonate ( HCO3-) to CO 2ratio. Due to the hyperventilation induced decrease in\nblood CO 2, the kidney secretes HCO 3-to maintain this ratio.  This reduces the amount\nof HCO 3-that can be used (via saliva) to buffer and maintain a healthy rumen pH. In\naddition, the heat -stressed cow ruminates less (because of the reduced feed intake\nand increased time respiring) and rumination is a key stimulator of saliva production.\nFurthermore, heat -stressed cows drool and this, coupled with reduced saliva\nproduction reduces the amount of buffering agents entering the rumen.\nConsequently, care should be taken when feeding \u201chot\u201d rations dur ing the summer\nmonths.  In addition, fiber quality is important all the time, but it is paramount during\nthe summer as it has some buffering capacity and stimulates saliva production\n(Baumgard and Rhoads, 2007).\nMetabolic Adaptations to Reduced Feed Int ake\nA prerequisite to understanding the metabolic adaptations which occur with heat\nstress, is an appreciation of the physiological and metabolic adjustments to thermal -\nneutral NEBAL (i.e. underfeeding or during the transition period).\nEarly lactation da iry cattle enter a unique physiological state during which they are\nunable to consume enough nutrients to meet maintenance and milk production costs\nand animals typically enter NEBAL (Moore et al., 2005).  Negative energy balance is\nassociated with a varie ty of metabolic changes that are implemented to support the\ndominant physiological condition of lactation (Bauman and Currie, 1980).  Marked\nalterations in both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism ensure partitioning of dietary\nand tissue derived nutrients t owards the mammary gland, and not surprisingly many\nof these changes are mediated by endogenous somatotropin which naturally increases\nduring periods of NEBAL.  One classic response is a reduction in circulating insulin\ncoupled with a reduction in systemic insulin sensitivity.  The reduction in insulin\naction activates adipose lipolysis, leading to the mobilization of non -esterified fatty\nacids (NEFA; Bauman and Currie, 1980).  Increased circulating NEFA are typical in\n\u201ctransitioning\u201d cows and represent (al ong with NEFA derived ketones) a significant15source of energy (and are precursors for milk fat synthesis) for cows in NEBAL.  Post -\nabsorptive carbohydrate metabolism is also altered by reduced insulin action during\nNEBAL which results in reduced glucose up take by systemic tissues (i.e. muscle and\nadipose).  Reduced nutrient uptake coupled with the net release of nutrients (i.e.\namino acids and NEFA) by systemic tissues are key homeorhetic (an acclimated\nresponse vs. an acute/homeostatic response) mechanisms implemented by cows in\nNEBAL to support lactation.  The thermal -neutral cow in NEBAL is metabolically\nflexible, and can depend upon alternative fuels (NEFA and ketones) to spare glucose\n(Baumgard and Rhoads, 2013).  Glucose can then be utilized by the mam mary gland to\ncopiously produce milk (Bauman and Currie, 1980).\nHeat Stress and Production Variables\nHeat stress reduces feed intake and milk yield in dairy cattle.  The decline in nutrient\nintake has been identified as a major cause of reduced production (Fuquay, 1981;\nWest, 2002; 2003).  However, the exact contribution of reduced feed intake to the\noverall reduced milk yield or average daily gain remains unknown.  To evaluate this\nquestion in both dairy and beef cattle we have conducted experiments invol ving a\ngroup of thermal neutral pair -fed animals to eliminate the confounding effects of\ndissimilar nutrient intake.  The pair -feeding model is necessary in order to\ndifferentiate between the direct and indirect effects of heat stress (mediated by\nreducedfeed intake) on production and metabolism.  Utilizing this model has allowed\nus to determine that the heat -induced decrease in nutrient intake only accounts for\napproximately 50% of the decrease in milk yield (Figures 1 and 2: Rhoads et al., 2009;\nWheelock et al., 2010).  The model indicates that direct effects of heat explain ~50 -\n60% of decreased milk synthesis.  Therefore, identifying hyperthermia -induced direct\nchanges is likely a prerequisite to develop mitigation strategies to maximize milk yield\nduring the warm summer months.\n16Figure 1.  Effects of heat stress and underfeeding (pair -feeding) thermal -neutral\nlactating Holstein cows on dry matter intake (Rhoads et al., 2009).\nFigure 2.  Effects of heat stress and underfeeding (pair -feeding) thermal neutral\nconditions on milk yield in lactating Holstein cows (Rhoads et al., 2009).\nPre-partum Heat Stress\nThe effects of heat stress during established lactation are well -characterized\n(Baumgard et al ., 2012; Baumgard and Rhoads, 2013), but the effects of\nenvironmental hyperthermia prior to calving on post -parturition production\nparameters is not as clear.  It was demonstrated that heat stress during the \u201cfar -off\u201d\nperiod reduced gestation length, calf body weight and subsequent milk yield, even in\nintensely cooled cows following calving (Collier et al., 1982).  This has recently been\nconfirmed and results indicate that future milk production is substantially reduced in\nheat-stressed dry cows (Tao et al. , 2012). Interesting, it appears that the heat -induced\nblunted adipose tissue mobilization \u201clingers\u201d into lactation and dry cows that were\nheat-stressed are not able to enlist glucose sparing mechanisms necessary to support\nmaximum milk yield, even though they were intensely cooled after calving (Tao et al.,\n2012).  In addition, future reproductive variables are determinately affected in heat -\nstressed dry cows (even if they were intensely cooled during lactation; Wiersma and\nArmstrong 1989).  Consequently, actively cooling dry cows should be an important\npart of a farm\u2019s heat stress abatement strategy.17Theoretical Reasons for Altered Metabolism\nWell-fed ruminants primarily oxidize acetate (a rumen produced VFA) as a principal\nenergy source.  During NEBAL c attle increased their energy dependency on NEFA.\nHowever, despite the fact that heat -stressed cows have marked reductions in feed\nintake and are losing considerable amounts of body weight, they do not mobilize\nadipose tissue (Rhoads et al., 2009; Wheelock et al., 2010).  Therefore, it appears that\nheat stressed cattle experience altered post -absorptive metabolism compared to\nthermal neutral counterparts, even though they are in a similar negative energetic\nstate.  The unusual lack of NEFA response in heat -stressed cows is probably in part\nexplained by increased circulating insulin levels (O\u2019Brien et al., 2010; Wheelock et al.,\n2010), as insulin is a potent anti -lipolytic hormone.  Increased circulating insulin\nduring heat stress is unusual as malnourished a nimals are in a catabolic state and\nexperience decreased insulin levels.  The increase in insulin action may also explain\nwhy heat -stressed animals have increased rates of glucose disposal (Wheelock et al.,\n2010).  Therefore, during heat stress, preventing or blocking adipose\nmobilization/breakdown and increasing glucose \u201cburning\u201d is presumably a strategy to\nminimize metabolic heat production (Baumgard and Rhoads, 2007).\nThe increase in extra -mammary glucose utilization during heat stress creates a\nnutrient trafficking problem with regards to milk yield.  The mammary gland requires\nglucose to synthesize milk lactose and lactose is the primary osmoregulator, thus\ndetermines overall milk volume.  However, in an attempt to generate less metabolic\nheat, the body (presumably skeletal muscle) appears to utilize glucose at an increased\nrate.  Therefore, the mammary gland may not receive adequate amounts of glucose, as\na result mammary lactose production and subsequently milk yield is reduced.  This\nmay be the primar y mechanism which accounts for the additional reductions in milk\nyield beyond the portion explained by decreased feed intake (Figures 1 and 2).\nHeat Stress and Immunity\nThe metabolic profile of heat -stressed cattle shares some similarities to animals with\na stimulated immune system and this is primarily characterized by hyperinsulinemia\n(Baumgard and Rhoads, 2013). The increased circulating insulin during heat stress is\nunusual because reduced feed intake, negative energy balance and body weight loss\n(hallmarks of heat stress) are typically associated with hypoinsulinemia.  Incidentally,\nlactating cows with an activated immune system also have increased circulating\ninsulin concentrations despite reduced feed intake (Waldron et al., 2006). Reasons for\nthe hyperinsulinemia are not clear, but may include lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an\nendotoxin produced by gram -negative bacteria. We have demonstrated that cattle IV\ninfused with LPS have marked (>50 fold) hyperinsulinemia 2 hours after LPS\nadministration (Rhoads e t al., 2009; Figure 3). Interestingly, the severe increase in\ninsulin following LPS injection only causes minor hypoglycemia and this likely means\nthat LPS causes insulin resistance. Heat -stressed rodents, poultry, pigs and humans\nhave increased levels of circulating LPS because of intestinal integrity issues and18presumably assume heat -stressed cattle do as well. Insulin\u2019s role during the immune\nresponse and during heat acclimation is not clear, but proper insulin action is\nnecessary in order to up -regulate heat shock proteins.\nFigure 3. Effects of LPS infusion on blood insulin concentrations in growing Holstein\ncalves either in heat -stressed (HS) or thermal neutral (TN) conditions (Rhoads et al.,\n2009).\nHeat Stress Abatement\nHeat abatement strateg ies are often employed as a means to ameliorate the negative\neffects of heat stress on production during the warm summer months (Smith et al.,\n2006).  Cooling cows with shade and evaporative cooling with soakers and fans is a\nrelatively cheap strategy to h elp minimize economic losses during an increased heat\nload (Collier et al., 2006).  However, despite new barn construction and heat\nabatement systems, milk yield and other production parameters continue to be\nadversely affected by heat stress (Burgos et al ., 2007).\nFeedstuffs have varying heat increments (HI), largely due to efficiency of nutrient\nutilization or digestive end products (VanSoest et al., 1991). Fiber digestion results in\na higher heat increment (sum of heat produced from rumen fermentation a nd nutrient\nmetabolism) than digestion of fat or non -fiber carbohydrates (NFC).  The major end\nproduct of fiber fermentation (acetate) is utilized less efficiently compared to the\nmajor end product of NFC digestion (propionate; Baldwin et al., 1980) .19The table below illustrates heat increments of several common feedstuffs.  The heat\nincrement value expressed as Kcal/Mcal, net energy lactation (NE L)was derived for\ntotal digestible nutrient (TDN) values of 40 -100% and fitted to a multiple linear\nregressio n model: y=a+bx+cx2. Where y= Kcal HI/Mcal NE Land x=TDN solved\nconstants are a= 1350.812, b= -17.1496, and c= 0.091517 (Chandler, 1994).\nTable 1.

A common\nstrategy is to increase the energy and nutrient density (reduced fiber, increased\nconcentrates and supplemental fat) of the diet as feed intake is markedly decreased\nduring heat stress.  In addition to the energy balance concer n, reducing the fiber\ncontent of the diet is thought to improve the cow\u2019s thermal balance and may reduce\nbody temperature.  However, increasing ration concentrates should be considered\nwith care as heat -stressed cows are highly prone to rumen acidosis.\nFiber:\nFiber is necessary for proper rumen function; current recommendations state a\nminimum dietary neutral detergent fiber (NDF) of 25% with the proportion of NDF\nfrom roughages equaling 75% of total NDF (NRC, 2001).  However, its digestion and\nmetabolism create more heat than compared to concentrates (VanSoest et al., 1991).20One common nutritional strategy involves reducing dietary fiber during an increased\nheat-load.  However, a dequate fiber in the diet is essential to maintain rumen health,\nand high qu ality forage helps to maintain feed intake.  Grant (1997) demonstrated\nthat a roughage NDF value of 60% still provides sufficient fiber for production of fat\ncorrected milk.  On the other hand, Kanjanapruthipong and Thaboot (2006)\nspeculated that the minim um dietary NDF of 23% DM and roughage NDF proportion\nof 55% dietary NDF have sufficient effective NDF for dairy cows in the tropics.\nProtein:\nDue to reduced feed intake, dietary protein levels may need to be increased during\nheat stress (West, 1999).  H uber et al. (1993) demonstrated that heat -stressed cows\nfed lower soluble protein levels had increased milk yield and increased dry matter\nintake (DMI). Huber et al. (1994) showed that heat -stressed cows fed a highly\ndegradable protein diet (65% of crude protein (CP)) had a 6% reduction in DMI and\nan 11% decrease in milk yield when compared to diets with lower degradable protein\n(59%) or diets with lower CP (16%). This agrees with recent recommendations\nwhich suggest that addition of dietary CP, more spec ifically rumen un -degradable\nprotein, is not helpful (Arieli et al., 2006).  A possible reason why highly degradable\nprotein diets appear to be deleterious during heat stress is that both rumen motility\nand rate of passage decline.  This allows for a longe r residence time and thus more\nextensive protein degradation (Linn, 1997).  We have demonstrated that blood urea\nnitrogen is elevated in heat -stressed cows compared to pair -fed controls (Wheelock et\nal., 2010), although it is not clear whether this origina tes from excess rumen ammonia\nproduction or from skeletal muscle breakdown.  Regardless, excess ammonia needs to\nbe eliminated and this removal has an energy cost (7.2 kcal/g of nitrogen; and thus\nincreases heat production) as it is metabolized to urea and excreted in the urine\n(Tyrell et al., 1970). How heat stress affects dietary protein requirements is ill -\ndefined and more research is needed in order to generate more appropriate\nrecommendations.\nFat:\nIncreasing the amount of dietary fat has been a wid ely accepted strategy within the\nindustry in order to reduce basal metabolic heat production.  As stated above, the heat\nincrement of fat is over 50% less than typical forages (Table 1) so it is seemingly a\nrational decision to supplement additional lipid and reduce fiber content of the diet.\nHowever, there are surprisingly few experiments specifically designed to evaluate\nhow supplemental dietary fat affects body temperature indices or even production\nparameters (Table 2).  Most experiments report little or no differences in rectal\ntemperatures (Moody et al., 1967; Knapp and Grummer 1991; Chan et al., 1997;\nDrackely et al., 2003) and only one paper demonstrated a slight reduction at a specific\ntime of day but not at the other times (Wang et al., 2010).  In fact, one report indicated21that cows fed additional fat actually had increased in rectal temperatures (Moallem et\nal., 2010) and these same authors and a recent report (Wang et al., 2010) indicate that\nadditional fat -fed cows had increased respiration rat es.  A reason why feeding fat does\nnot seemingly improve the thermal balance of heat -stressed cows is difficult to\nrationalize.  It could be that small decreases in a thermal load would be difficult to\ndetect at specific but limited time points, but that t hese minor changes would\naccumulate over time into a significant improvement.  It would be of interest to\nevaluate body temperatures in heat -stressed cows fed additional fat utilizing a\ncontinuous thermometer system (i.e. HOBOs or eye -button technology).\nAdditional fat feeding can sometimes decrease DMI in thermal neutral cows (Chillard,\n1993) but reduced nutrient intake is typically not observed in heat -stressed cows fed\nsupplemental fat (Moody et al., 1967; Skaar et al., 1989; Knapp and Grummer, 1991;\nDrackely et al., 2003; Warntjes et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010).  Milk yield responses to\nadditional fat are variable and some authors report no diet effect (Moody et al., 1967;\nKnapp and Grummer, 1991; Chan et al., 1997; Moallem et al., 2010) while others\nreport an increase in milk yield (Skaar et al., 1989; Drackely et al., 2003; Warntjes et\nal., 2008; Wang et al., 2010).  Similar to body temperature indices and milk yield data,\nthe effects of dietary fat on milk composition during heat stress also vary a nd no clear\nconsensus has been reached (Table 2).  Overall, results from a limited number of\nexperiments vary, but little or no apparent benefit was typically observed when\nsupplemental dietary fat was included.  Reasons for the discrepancies are unclear, but\ncould be due to the type of fats used (saturated vs. unsaturated), rate of inclusion, type\nof \u201cprotection\u201d (i.e. calcium salt vs. prill), environmental factors (i.e. severity of heat\nstress), or other dietary interactions.  Regardless, the dairy indust ry (nutritionists)\nneeds additional controlled experiments (besides theoretical heat calculations) in\norder to make intelligent ration balancing decisions regarding the inclusion of\nsupplemental fat.\nIonophores :\nWe propose enhanced extra -mammary tissue g lucose utilization may be a key\nmechanism explaining the decrease in milk yield during heat stress.  Two glucose\nmolecules are the substrate for lactose (the primary osmotic regulator of milk yield)\nsynthesis and on a molar basis; lactose is nearly equival ent (95%) to two moles of\nglucose.  Heat -stressed cows secrete about 370 g less lactose (Rhoads et al., 2009) or\nhave approximately twice as much of a decrease in milk lactose yield as pair -fed\nthermal neutral controls (Wheelock et al., 2010).    Therefore , heat-stressed cows in\nour previous experiments are secreting almost 400 g less glucose/d than thermal\nneutral counterparts on a similar plane of nutrition. Monensin is a well -described\nrumen modifier that increases the production of propionate, which is the predominate\ngluconeogenic precursor in ruminants. The increase in carbon conservation during\nfermentation is a key mechanism in how monensin increases feed efficiency in\ngrowing and lactating ruminants.  We have now demonstrated that monensin\nincreases the gluconeogenic rates (on a DMI basis) and utilizing monensin is a key\nstrategy to improve the glucose status of heat -stressed cows (Baumgard et al., 2011).22Water:\nWater intake is vital for milk production (milk is ~87% water) but it is also essential\nfor thermal homeostasis.  This stresses how important water availability and\nwaterer/tank cleanliness becomes during the summer months.  Keeping water tanks\nclear of feed debris and algae is a simple and cheap strategy to help cows remain cool\n(Baumgard a nd Rhoads, 2007)\nDietary Cation -Anion Difference (DCAD):\nHaving a negative DCAD during the dry period and a positive DCAD during lactation is\na good strategy to maintain health and maximize production (Block, 1994).  It appears\nthat keeping the DCAD at a healthy lactating level (~+20 to +30 meq/100 g DM)\nremains a good strategy during the warm summer months (Wildman et al., 2007).\nMinerals:\nUnlike humans, bovines utilize potassium (K+) as their primary osmotic regulator of\nwater secretion from sweat gl ands.  As a consequence, K+requirements are increased\n(1.4 to 1.6% of DM) during the summer and this should be adjusted for in the diet.  In\naddition, dietary levels of sodium (Na+) and magnesium (Mg+) should be increased as\nthey compete with K+for intestinal absorption (West, 2002).\nConclusions\nHeat stress negatively impacts economic parameters associated with profitable milk\nproduction.  Implementing heat stress abatement strategies is crucial to minimize\nfiscal losses.  In addition to physical barn ma nagement, nutritional strategies can be\nimplemented to help ameliorate summer -induced losses.  Maintaining rumen health is\nof primary importance as heat -stressed cows are more prone (for a variety of\nreasons) to rumen acidosis.  Another widely held dogma i s that supplementing dietary\nfat is an effective tactic during heat stress and this stems from theoretical calculations\nindicating that the heat increment of feeding is much lower for lipids (especially\ncompared to roughages).  However, a review of the lim ited literature fails to\ncorroborate the arithmetic heat savings or ultimately demonstrate a consistent effect\non production parameters.  The dairy industry needs definitive research on whether\nor not to include supplemental fat during the warm summer mont hs.23Table 2.

Garrick\nLush Chair in Animal Breeding & Genetics\nDepartment of Animal Science\nIowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, USA\nSummary\nPeru has a significant cattle population but is a net importer of beef.  The efficiency of\nbeef production in Peru could be improved by changing the genetic makeup of the\nPeruvian herd.  In theory, this could be done by crossbreeding, grading up to\nalternative breeds, or by within breed selection among existing cattle. The\nopportunities and challenges of some of these options are discussed, including the use\nof new genomic tools to enhance selection.  The most practical option might be to\nundertake marker -assisted selection using major gene effects that have been\nidentified elsewhere in the world and whose effects have been validated under\nPeruvian climatic, management and economic circumstances.\nResumen\nSelecci\u00f3n g en\u00f3mica y mejoramiento gen\u00e9tico en vacuno s\nPer\u00fa tiene una poblaci\u00f3n significativa de vacunos de leche, pero es un importador\nneto de carne de vacuno.

It is a net importer of beef and dairy products.  Argentina and\nBrazil have ten and forty times great er cattle numbers, respectively.  There are many\nopportunities to increase beef production throughout countries in South America,\nincluding the use of improved cattle germplasm more suited to local environments,\nand the use of improved nutritional regimes that can increase growth rates and\nreduce ages at harvest.  This paper considers the opportunities and challenges for\ngenetic improvement of South American beef cattle.\nGenetic improvement\nAppropriate choice of breed or breed -crosses, as well as within br eed selection can\ncontribute to improved efficiency of beef production.  Some particular challenges in\nPeruvian beef production include some high altitude production systems, some hot\nand humid climatic conditions, and low forage quality and quantity. Catt le often\nstruggle to perform at high altitude due to their susceptibility to high -altitude or\nbrisket disease (Shirley et al., 2008; Wuletaw et al., 2011), unless they have a history\nof breeding and selection at altitude such as in the Andes, Northwest Eth iopia, Rocky\nMountains or European alps.  Cattle selected for high performance in temperate\nenvironments struggle to achieve high levels of reproductive performance in hot and\nhumid conditions.  In those circumstances, Bos indicus cattle or tropically -adaptedBos\ntaurusbreeds will typically outperform breeds that are more productive in temperate\nconditions (Burrow et al., 2001).  Cross -breeding therefore needs to be approached\nwith caution, and with careful choice of breeds if it is to include anything oth er than\nlocally-adapted breeds.  However, small population sizes and low adoption of breed\nimprovement technologies have frequently limited genetic improvement in locally -\nadapted breeds.  Nevertheless, conventional selection offers promise if appropriately\nimplemented, but perhaps not as much as leveraging information discovered in other\nbreeds and countries using new genomic technologies.  This paper reviews some of\nthese opportunities in the context of improving beef cattle in some parts of South\nAmerica.\nCrossbreeding\nOutcrossing or outbreeding is the opposite of inbreeding and refers to the mating of\nanimals that are more distantly related than would occur from random mating.  An\nextreme form of outcrossing is crossbreeding whereby animals of different breeds are\nbred together.  In general this can have several advantages, one of which is heterosis\nor hybrid vigor whereby the first -cross animals outperform the average of the\nparental breeds.  Another advantage is complementarity, which can occur in the\nabsence of heterosis, and reflects weaknesses in one breed being complemented by\nstrengths in the other breed, and vice versa, so that considering all traits the30crossbred is more desirable than the contributing purebreds. In practice there is often\na problem that natural or artificial selection has been very successful in improving a\nparticular breed so that it is well -adapted to a particular climatic, management or\neconomic circumstance, but no other competitive breeds exist, with the effect that any\ncrossbreeding might result in inferior animals relative to the adapted breed.  This is\nthe situation in dairy production using the Holstein breed in some intensive,\ntemperate environments.  Another practical complication with crossbreeding is that\nthe first-cross animals may have production superior to the indigenous adapted\nbreed, and thereby immediately recognized as being beneficial in production\ncircumstances with high or low management levels.  However, if first -crosses are\nbackcrossed to the foreign breed, the resultant animal with only an average \u00bc\nadapted genome may be too poorly adapted and therefore poor performing,\nparticularly in terms of reproduction, and more so in environments with low\nmanagement levels (Madalena, 1987).  If the first -cross is back crossed to the\nindigenous breed, the resultant animals with \u00bc foreign breed may not be notably\nbetter than the locally -adapted breed. Finally, if the superiority of the first -cross\nincludes a substantial component of heterosis, then second -cross animals ma y be\nmarkedly inferior to the first -cross.  This limits the value of crossbreeding unless first -\ncross animals can be continuously obtained from some other source.  Other issues\nwith crossbreeding include the segregation of major gene effects influencing\nappearance, including coat color, coat color pattern, presence of horns, slick hair coats\netc, that may not be desirable in local circumstances.  Finally, crossbreeding can be\nproblematic to manage in practice in small herds if it requires maintenance of\nmultiple sire breeds.\nIn the absence of genotype -environment interaction, and when several breeds are\nequally competitive as purebreds, crossbred or advanced crosses known as composite\ncattle are commonplace, as is the circumstance in the US beef industry.  I n South\nAmerica where it is common for cattle to be stressed, either through climate (e.g. heat\nand humidity), altitude, nutritional deprivation (e.g. dry season), or disease,\ncrossbreeding may not be a practical alternative because there may be only one\nlocally adapted breed and it may therefore not be possible to find another breed that\nis equally competitive.  This is the case in humid and tick -infested parts of Brazil for\nexample, where other breeds struggle to compete in overall performance with\ntropically-adapted tick -tolerantBos indicus cattle such as Nellore.\nFurthermore, it is important in the development of crossbreeding programs that the\nperformance of the crosses are well characterized across the entire range of traits that\nare important from an economic or management viewpoint.  In the US, extensive\ngermplasm evaluation (GPE) studies at US -MARC in Clay Center Nebraska\n(http://www.ars.usda.gov/News/docs.htm?docid=6238) are a good example of\nthorough research that ensures producers have access to quality information when\nconsidering a crossbreeding program in mid Western US production circumstances.31Pedigree -based within -breed selection\nNatural and artificial selection within a population can, in successive generations,\nimprove its adaptation to environmental circumstances and increase its productivity.\nNatural selection influences fitness, whereas artificial selection can influence any\nheritable trait for which the selection candidates deviate from population average.\nNatural selection does not require any pedigree or performance testing, whereas\nartificial selection requires that the selection candidates can be ranked in relation to\nthe attribute under selection.\nThe efficiency of artificial selection will be influenced by the accuracy of tha t ranking\nwhich we measure as the correlation between true and estimated merit, or its square,\nwhich we refer to as reliability.  In the case of artificial selection based only on\nindividual phenotype, the efficiency of selection is directly related to the strength of\nthe association between genotype and phenotype, which is reflected in a parameter\nknown as heritability.  However, if non -genetic factors such as age at measurement,\nage of dam, or season of calving influence phenotype, and cannot be recorded and\ntaken into account in the ranking process, then mass selection on individual\nphenotype will not be as effective as implied by the heritability.  If cohort groups, such\nas animals of the same sex born in the same herd -year-season, comprise no more than\na few animals, then reliabilities of prediction can be compromised by non -genetic\neffects even if recording is of a high standard.  This is particularly problematic for\ncategorical traits (e.g. calving score), where no useful information is obtained if all\nanimals in the cohort have the same categorical score.\nThe reliabilities of predictions can be improved by including pedigree information and\nperformance measured on relatives, particularly for traits that are sex -limited or\nmeasured later in life.  How ever, obtaining pedigree information can be problematic\nin multi-sire pastures, particularly under extensive conditions.\nThe intensity of selection is determined by the proportion of available candidates that\nare chosen to be parents of the next generati on.  In a sufficiently large population, the\nintensities of selection on each selection pathway (e.g. sires, dams) are insensitive to\npopulation size.  However, in small populations, the selection intensity may be\nreduced because the selection proportion h as to be large.  For example, if the mating\nratio is 1 bull to 100 cows, and a herd must use at least two sires, the selection\nintensity will be compromised if the herd includes less than 200 cows.\nWithin-breed selection can be more efficient if data from different herds can be\npooled together, ideally including all performance recorded animals in a particular\nenvironmental circumstance.  However, such national improvement programs require\nvarious infrastructure, including consistent animal identification s ystem, consistent\ntrait definitions, and database systems to store and access pedigree and performance\ninformation.  Finally, the analysis of this data to make the most of across -herd and\nacross-generational information involves the development and use of computer\nsoftware that requires skilled expertise.  Collectively, the development of successful\nnational improvement programs can be particularly problematic in countries that do32not have experience in such data collection and analysis, or lack a core of m otivated\nbreeders with a history of careful pedigree and performance recording along with\ncompetent animal management.\nGenomic improvement\nThe distinction between genetic and genomic improvement is that the latter uses\nmolecular features spanning the whol e-genome.  In beef cattle breeding the molecular\nfeatures have most commonly comprised 50k or more approximately evenly -spaced\nsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).  These 50k SNP genotypes are readily\navailable from DNA obtained from hair follicles or o ther tissues at a cost of US$50 -100\nper animal depending upon numbers of animals being genotyped.  For training and\ndiscovery purposes as described below, a minimum of 1,000 genotyped animals are\nrequired for most endeavors.\nGenomic selection\nGenomic sele ction refers to breeding strategies that use whole -genome information\nalong with performance and perhaps pedigree information to rank selection\ncandidates.  Its recent popularity was stimulated by a theoretical paper (Meuwissen et\nal., 2001) that outlined some analytical approaches about 5 years before Illumina\nbeadchip SNP genotypes (http://www.illumina.com/products/bovine_snp50_whole -\ngenome_genotyping_kits.ilmn) became practically available for large numbers of\nanimals, at prices that were a fraction of t he cost of previous microsatellite genotyping\nstrategies that had been used for research.  The original Meuwissen et al. (2001)\nconcept involved a two -step process.  First was the generation of a prediction\nequation obtained by statistical analysis of a hi storical population of animals with SNP\ngenotypes and phenotypes, or SNP genotypes and progeny test predictions of genetic\nmerit.  These animals are known as the \u201ctraining\u201d or discovery population.  The\nanalysis involves calculating the genetic merit of al l the chromosome fragments that\nare present in the training population.  The number of animals required for this\nprocess depends upon the desired accuracy of future predictions, the effective\npopulation size of the breed, the heritability of the trait, amo ng other factors (Goddard\nand Hayes, 2009).  Less than 10 animals may be required to map a monogenic trait\nthat has accurate phenotypes, but polygenic traits requires a minimum of thousands\nof animals in the training population to obtain accurate predictio n equations\n(Goddard and Hayes, 2009).  The second step in genomic prediction is to apply the\nprediction equation to rank new selection candidates.  This process will be more\naccurate if the selection candidates are immediate descendants of animals in the\ntraining population.  Modern approaches to this problem allow these two steps to be\ncombined in a single analysis that can exploit pedigree, performance and genomic\ninformation (Aguilar et al., 2010; Fernando et al., 2014).33Genomic prediction has been wide ly-adopted throughout the world for dairy cattle\nimprovement, with some training populations now exceeding 100,000 animals.  Its\nadoption has been slower in beef cattle, but many US breed associations now include\ngenomic information in their predictions of merit (Saatchi et al., 2011; 2012; 2013),\nand training populations now exceed 10,000 animals for each of a number of breeds.\nThe original Illumina 50K beadchip has now been augmented with custom content,\nand proprietary chips such as the GeneSeek Genomic Profilers (GGP -\nhttp://www.neogen.com/Agrigenomics/Beef.html#Seedstock) in low -density (GGP -\nLD now 30k) and high -density (GGP -HD about 70k), these now being more widely\nused than the 50k in US beef cattle circumstances.  Alternative custom low -density\npanels are used in dairy and beef cattle in some other countries, particularly in\nEurope.  Many training populations have been genotyped at a mixture of different\ndensities, requiring strategies like imputation (Browning and Browning, 2009) to be\napplied so that all animals in the training population have (imputed) genotypes of the\nsame density.  The major advantages of the GGP -LD is that the genotyping cost is\nmuch less than for the 50k, the public content is well distributed along the genome to\nprovide high -accuracy imputation and reliable parentage determination, while the\ncustom content directly interrogates important mutations such as deleterious genes\nso that one genotyping proves can provide all the information required by most\nbreeders.  The major adva ntage of the GGP -HD is that in addition to the public content\nfrom the GGP -LD chip it includes additional markers in regions where the 50k content\nwas inadequate, and fewer markers where 50k content was superfluous.\nIn contrast to original speculation, it is apparent that continued augmentation of the\ntraining population with additional animals with genotypes and phenotypes is\nrequired, necessitating continued collection of phenotypic information (Wolc et al.,\n2011).  Genotyping has accordingly provided mor e accurate prediction of young\nanimals than was previously possible, but has not allowed for investment in collection\nof phenotypes to be markedly reduced.\nTo date, the development of beef cattle training populations in South America has\nlagged North Ameri ca and Europe.  This is likely partly due to the initial investment\nrequired in genotyping the training population, and partly because national breed\nimprovement programs that collect and characterize breeding merit have typically\ninvolved fewer animals wi th large numbers of progeny, and a lesser range of trait\nmeasurements. Some work has been undertaken with Nellore cattle in Brazil (Lobo et\nal., 2011; Neves et al., 2014), Hereford cattle in Uruguay and Argentina (Saatchi et al.,\n2013), and Angus cattle in Argentina (unpublished).\nDetection of major gene effects\nGenomic prediction computes the genetic merit of every chromosome fragment\npresent in the training population, the chromosome fragments being identified by the\nSNP genotypes they contain and those flanking SNPs in the immediate vicinity.\nGenomic prediction assesses the merit of a newly genotyped animal by summing up34the genetic merits of all the chromosome fragments that animal appears to have\ninherited.  It is often assumed that complex quantitati ve traits are determined by a\npolygenic or infinitesimal model, involving a large number of genes each contributing\na small amount to the variation in the trait.  It now seems more likely that many\npolygenic traits include some genomic regions with larger, readily detectable effects,\nas well as many genomic regions with small effects.  Characterizing the effects of\nvarious regions in order to find those with largest effects is known as a genome -wide\nassociation study (GWAS).  These have been applied in a nu mber of beef cattle breeds,\nacross a range of traits and represent widely -used bulls and encompass all those traits\nroutinely measured by breed associations (e.g. birth, weaning, yearling weights,\ncalving ease), or research animals that comprise a specific experiment and specific\ntrait(s) of interest (e.g. feed efficiency, fatty acid profile, or disease resistance).\nResults to date show a surprisingly high degree of commonality between regions\nidentified with large effects, those regions being identified a cross disparate breeds,\nand within breed, across a wide range of traits (Saatchi et al., 2014).  Considerable\neffort including next -generation sequencing of individual sires is now being\nundertaken with a view to fine map and ultimately determine the causa l mutation(s)\nfor these large gene effects.  In the absence of knowledge of causal mutations, or\ntightly linked markers conserved across breeds, results from attempts to train in one\nbreed or population and predict merit in another breed or population have not been\nvery promising (Kachman et al., 2013).\nMarker-assisted selection\nMarker-assisted selection uses markers to predict or infer the presence of favorable\nalleles at one or more loci in selection candidates.  Prior to application of marker -\nassisted s election, favorable regions of the genome must be somehow identified,\ncommonly by undertaking genome -wide association studies.  Marker -assisted\nselection is most straightforward if markers in high linkage disequilibrium with the\ncausal mutation have been i dentified.  In that case, the selection can be done across\nfamilies or breeds.  Some early applications of marker -assisted selection required\nspecific characterization of alleles within each family, limiting their utility to\npopulations with extensive pedi gree and performance recording (Dekkers, 2004).\nMarker-assisted selection has now commonly been superseded with genomic\nselection, typically using genome -wide SNP markers or perhaps just that subset of\nmarkers flanking the regions of interest.\nApplying ma rker-assisted selection in countries like Peru could be undertaken to\nselect for regions of interest that have been identified in local studies, but that would\nrequire careful pedigree and performance recording in sufficiently large populations\nprior to im plementation.  Alternatively, it could be used to select for genomic regions\nthat have been identified in other production circumstances, such as in other breeds\nor from other countries in South America or elsewhere in the world.  The effects of\nalternate alleles at the genomic region of interest would need to be quantified and\nvalidated in the local population prior to their use in selection.  There is a recent35example of such a finding in a gene known as PLAG1 influencing growth rate (Karim et\nal., 2011) and fertility (Fortes et al., 2013).\nA major gene was coarsely mapped to the region around 24 -26 cM on chromosome 14\nin Japanese Wagyu cattle.  A major gene segregating in F2 Holstein -Friesian Jersey\ncattle in the same chromosomal region was subsequently f ine-mapped and a mutation\ninPLAG1was identified as one of three concordant mutations that could have caused\nthe observed variation (Karim et al., 2011).  The same region was discovered to have\nmajor effects in a number of Bos taurus andBos indicus breeds studied in Australia,\nand the mutation proposed by Karim et al. (2011) was shown to explain the observed\ndifferences (Fortes et al., 2013).  The same genomic region was also reported to be\nsegregating pleiotropic effects for a range of traits in a number of US breeds (Saatchi\net al., 2014).  The Australian data showed that in Bos indicus cattle the allele\nassociated with increased growth (14 kg effect on liveweight at feedlot exit) was also\nassociated with delayed puberty (38 days) and extended post -partum anestrus\ninterval (15 days).  This gene therefore appears to be segregating in a wide variety of\nBos taurus andBos indicus breeds, and exhibits the same direction of effects.  One\nbreeding strategy would be to use breeding cows with at least one of the allele\nassociated with smaller size, earlier puberty and reduced intercalving interval, and\nbreed these cows to sires that carry one or two copies of the allele associated with\ndelayed puberty and increased weight. Potential sires and replacement heifers w ould\nneed to be tested to determine their genotype at the PLAG1locus.\nAs more causal mutations are discovered there will be many more examples that\nshould be characterized in cattle breeds used in Peru and some might be applicable\nfor selection in Peruvi an circumstances.\nMarker-assisted introgression\nIntrogression is the process of introducing a mutation from another individual into a\npopulation in which that mutation does not already exist.  For example, it could be\nused to introduce the polled locus in to a horned breed, or the myostatin or double -\nmuscled variant into a normally -muscled breed, or the tropically -adapted slick hair\nlocus into a breed that cannot otherwise tolerate hot and humid conditions.  Provided\nthe three alternative genotypes (QQ, Qq and qq) can be cheaply and easily identified\nfrom phenotype, the introgression can be done without markers.  However, many\nmutations of interest may be sex -limited, exhibited late in life, or may demonstrate\ndominant gene action, in which case the introgre ssion will be much more effective if it\ncan be undertaken based on direct interrogation of the introgressed DNA.  This can be\ndone by marker -assisted introgression of a large DNA fragment known to contain the\nmutation of interest, even if the causal mutati on has not been characterized.\nAlternatively, if the mutation is known, the introgression can be more effective if the\nnumber of copies of the desirable allele can be directly interrogated.  Marker -assisted\nselection differs from marker -assisted introgres sion in that marker -assisted selection\ntargets mutations that are already segregating in the population of interest whereas36marker-assisted introgression requires initial crossing to introduce the desirable\nmutation.  Once introduced, backcrossing of carri ers is followed by selection of those\noffspring carrying the new mutation with the aim of producing heterozygous animals\nthat only contain genome fragments of the other breed in the immediate region of the\nnew mutation. Such animals can then be interbred t o produce homozygotes of this\nnew mutation in the genetic background of the local breed.\nGene editing\nCreation of transgenic livestock has historically involved a somewhat primitive\nprocess, and has mostly commonly involved introducing traceable modificat ions that\ninclude DNA from other organisms (from transmeaning across).  In contrast to the\nsituation in plants, there are no examples of transgenic livestock that have markedly\nincreased productivity, and none have been accepted and adopted in local or\ninternational markets.  There have been a number of transgenic animals produced,\nprincipally targeted at the production of pharmaceutical products from milk, such as\nhuman lactoferrin in dairy cattle, or \u03b1-1-anti-trypsin in dairy sheep.  Other transgenic\nanimals have been produced for increasing knowledge of biology (e.g. Australian\nstudies modifying the protein composition of wool to produce stronger woolen yarns),\nor as models of human disease (e.g. intr oduction of the Huntingtons disease mutation\nin sheep).\nGene editing offers a markedly different approach to creating more productive\nlivestock.  In its first applications, it is more likely to be used to produce cisgenic\nindividuals (from cismeaning same ), and the outcome will be animals that do not\ncontain any foreign DNA and their genomes are not detectable as having been\nmodified.  Gene editing can now be done using one of three different technologies;\nZFN, TALENS, or CRISPR (Gaj et al., 2013).  In all three approaches, a particular\nmutation of interest can be targeted, and the use of natural DNA breakage and repair\nmechanisms can be used to naturally produce an animal carrying the desired\nmutation.  Likely candidates for mutation would include genes to be disrupted to\nrender them dysfunctional (i.e. knocked out), to be disrupted to reduce their level of\nexpression (i.e. knocked down), or to be modified to mimic an existing mutation\nalready found to desirably influence performance in some other breed of cattle.  Such\ncattle would be functionally indistinguishable from those that could be produced by\nmarker-assisted introgression, but would be produced in a much shorter timeframe\nand at much less cost.37Conclusions\nSelection within or across breeds can b e used to improve cattle productivity and\nprofitability.  However, these options are not available in all climatic, management\nand economic circumstances.  This is particularly true for animals managed in small\nherds in stressful environments.  New approac hes to selection that utilize genomic\ntechnologies offer real promise for application in circumstances where funds are\navailable for genotyping and there is already a database comprising historical\npedigree and performance records of large cohorts of cattl e.  In the absence of such a\ndatabase, there are opportunities for marker -assisted selection for variants\ndiscovered in other breeds or populations, provided those variants can be shown to\nbe segregating in local breeds and demonstrating phenotypic differe nces in local\nenvironmental conditions for the trait of interest.  If the variant is not segregating, and\nthe local breeds are fixed fro the unfavorable allele, then there is the opportunity for\nmarker-assisted introgression of the alternate allele.  In fu ture, gene editing may\nprovide options for directly producing biologically motivated variants of interest for\nlocal validation and exploitation to improve cattle production.\nReferences\nAguilar, I., I.

Despite their major contribution to meeting current human\nneeds for food and clothing, a significant increase in production efficiency of ruminant\nlivestock species will be needed to meet the future needs of the world\u2019s rapidly\ngrowing human popula tion. Some have estimated the global population of humans to\nreach 9.6 billion by the year 2050 (Searchinger et al., 2014), and the food supply will\nneed to double between now and then in order to avoid widespread famine.\nProduction efficiency of ruminant livestock species hinges on successful reproduction,\nand great attention must be given to reproduction if an increase in production\nefficiency is to be attained.  It is easy to understand that females who do not become\npregnant will not give birth to offsp ring which can subsequently be raised for meat,\nfiber, or hides. Furthermore, females who do not become pregnant will not initiate\nlactation and cannot, therefore, provide milk for human consumption. Thus,\nreproductive efficiency is of utmost importance to increasing overall production\nefficiency.\nSuccessful reproduction is necessary for a species to survive, and it seems logical that\nthere has been strong natural selection pressure exerted on this trait for many\ncenturies. However, successful reproduction is dependent on a series of biological\nevents occurring at a precise time and in a precise order, and any deviation from this\nexpected sequence of events can easily lead to reproductive failure. As livestock\nfarmers move animals from extensively -managed to intensively -managed production\nsettings, and as they deal with growing challenges such as global climate change, the\nopportunity for reproductive failure is a very real threat to global food and fiber\nproduction. The objective of this manuscript is to pro vide readers with a fundamental\nunderstanding of the reproductive process in ruminant livestock species, with a\nspecial focus on preimplantation embryonic development and survival.\nFour Major Components of Reproduction\nSuccessful reproduction can be defined as the production of live offspring from the\nmating of a male and female. Matings may occur by natural service or via alternative\nreproductive approaches such as artificial insemination or embryo transfer. The\nproduction of live offspring necessita tes that four distinct -but interrelated -\nbiological events occur.42The first of these biological events is the release of a viable oocyte (egg) from the\nfemale\u2019s ovarian follicle at the time of ovulation. Next, the ovulated egg must be\nfertilized by a viable spermatozoon from the male.  Thirdly, the fertilized egg (also\nknown as a zygote) must grow normally and must develop a functional placenta to\nenable the conceptus to attach to its mother\u2019s uterus. Lastly, the fetus must develop\nnormally in uterosothat a healthy neonate can be delivered at the time of parturition.\nThese four biological events -ovulation, fertilization, embryo development, fetal\ndevelopment -must occur sequentially and successfully in order for a viable offspring\nto be produced. I n polytocous species that typically produce more than one offspring\nper parturition, the rateat which these events occur dictates the level of reproductive\nefficiency. In addition, it should be clearly understood that failure at any one of the\nfour steps in the reproductive process will preclude occurrence of the other\nsubsequent reproductive events and will result in complete reproductive failure.\nOvulation Rate\nRuminant livestock species differ in the expected number of eggs released at the time\nof ovulation. Some ruminants, such as cattle and alpacas, are classified as monotocous\nbecause they typically release only one egg during the period of ovulation and\ntypically give birth to only one offspring per parturition. Other ruminants, such as\nsheep and go ats, are classified as polytocous because they typically release more than\none egg during the period of ovulation and give birth to one or more offspring per\nparturition.\nIn times of severe stress or negative energy balance (caused by underfeeding or the\ninability of the female to ingest sufficient dietary nutrients commensurate with her\nmetabolic needs), it is possible for ruminant females to be anovulatory. Such females\nwho do not ovulate obviously will not achieve successful reproduction. In monotocous\nfemales who ovulate a single egg, the number of offspring born is expected to be no\nmore than one because the occurrence of monozygotic (identical) twins is quite low in\nruminant livestock species (Johansson and Rendel, 1968).  In polytocous females, the\nnumber of eggs shed at ovulation sets the upper limit to the number of offspring\nproduced during that pregnancy; however, the release of multiple eggs does not\nguarantee that multiple offspring will be born because fertilization failure, embryo\ndeath loss an d/or fetal death loss could occur.\nFarmers and ranchers have the ability to potentially influence ovulation through\nmanagement choices they make. In cattle, peri -pubertal females should undergo\nreproductive tract scoring (Anderson et al, 1991) to ensure th at they are not in an\nanovulatory state. Reproductive tract scoring involves an assessment (via ultrasound\nor transrectal palpation) of the size and functionality of the ovaries, as well as the size\nand tone of the uterine horns. Females with a reproductiv e tract score of 4 or 5 are\nsexually mature and are ready for breeding.  Females with a reproductive tract score43of 3 or less, however, should not immediately be used for breeding.  Instead, they\nshould be given additional time to sexually mature (if among st the youngest of the\nreplacement females) or be culled from the breeding population (if amongst the oldest\nof replacement females).  In post -pubertal females, proper nutritional management\nshould occur to ensure that females attain an appropriate pre -breeding body\ncondition score (Edmonson et al., 1989).  Under -conditioned females are at risk for\nanovulation.\nIn polytocous species such as sheep, several factors are known to influence ovulation\nrate.  Firstly, the breed of female that farmers/ranchers cho ose to raise can impact\novulation rate. A number of prolific sheep breeds that exhibit high ovulation rates\nhave been identified (e.g., Finnish Landrace, Romanov), yet there are also other sheep\nbreeds (e.g., Rambouillet) that typically do not exhibit mult iple ovulations. Secondly,\nthe number of ovulations in sheep is influenced by the age of the breeding females.\nEwe lambs have lower average ovulation rate than do yearling ewes, which have\nlower average ovulation rate than older ewes. Thirdly, the specific time of mating\nwithin the biological breeding season can influence ovulation rate.  As females make\nthe transition from the non -breeding season to the breeding season, average ovulation\nrate tends to be low.  With each successive estrous cycle, mean ovula tion rate will\nincrease until the mid -point of the biological breeding season is reached.  Higher\novulation rates can be achieved if farmers simply delay the start of the breeding\nseason until after females have exhibited two or more estrous cycles.  Fourt hly,\nproper nutritional management of the breeding females will ensure that females are\nnot anovulatory. Ovulation rate of polytocous females potentially can also be\nincreased through the nutritional management practice known as flushing. Flushing is\ndefined as the feeding of an increased level of dietary nutrients for one estrous cycle\nprior to expected breeding and continuing for an additional estrous cycle thereafter.\nUsing sheep as an example, flushing would commence 17 days prior to the start of the\nbreeding period and continue each day until 17 days after the start of the breeding\nseason. Flushing seems to work best for females with the genetic potential for high\novulation rate (based on breed and age) but who are below average body condition\nscore (i.e., a body condition score of 2.5 or less -on a scale from 1=thin/emaciated to\n5=obese).\nFertilization Rate\nUnlike some species such as the pig where fertilization of only a portion of the\novulated eggs is fairly common, fertilization rate in ruminant li vestock species tends\nto be an all -or-nothing trait in naturally cycling females.  Either all of the eggs ovulated\nby a female are fertilized or none of them are fertilized. Overall, fertilization rate in\nwell-managed cattle and sheep is expected to be in excess of 90%.\nThere are two major factors impacting fertilization rate in ruminants: egg quality and\nsperm quality.  Oocyte quality can be adversely affected by heat stress, exposure to\ntoxicants, and negative energy balance.  These topics are being addre ssed by other44speakers in this symposium; thus, subsequent discussion will focus on sperm quality.\nSimilar to oocytes, quality of spermatozoa can be affected by a variety of\nenvironmental factors.  Farmers and ranchers should be vigilant about the water\nprovided to their breeding males as this is a common source of toxicants and heavy\nmetals that can impair fertility. Heat stress is also known to cause infertility, this\ndespite a sophisticated system to regulate and maintain temperature of the testes of\nruminant males. The temperature regulation system, designed to maintain\ntemperature of the testes 4 -6\u00b0C lower than the male\u2019s core body temperature, consists\nof the pampiniform plexus, the internal and external cremaster muscles, the tunica\ndartos muscle, and (in some species) sweat glands in the scrotum.  If temperature is\nnot maintained in the target temperature range, normal production of viable\nspermatozoa will not occur. Fortunately, the spermatogonial stem cells (A 0\nspermatogonia) are not particularly se nsitive to heat.\nFarmers and ranchers can potentially influence fertilization rate by management\ndecisions they make. On the female side, it is important to ensure proper nutritional\nmanagement of breeding females prior to the start of the breeding season to\npotentially reduce the incidence of poor oocyte quality due to negative energy\nbalance.  Providing breeding females with access to shade, fresh water, and ventilation\n(if animals are intensively managed) can potentially reduce heat -induced change s in\noocyte quality. Maintaining breeding animals in an environment free of heavy metals,\nenvironmental estrogens, or other compounds that can be toxic to oocytes can\npotentially aid in a high rate of fertilization.\nFarmers and ranchers can potentially avo id problems with poor quality of\nspermatozoa by providing proper nutritional management of breeding males (to\nensure that males do not become over -or under -conditioned), as well as by providing\nshade, fresh water, and adequate ventilation in order to avoi d heat stress. Livestock\nproducers are advised to have a breeding soundness exam (Cehnoweth et al, 1993)\nperformed on any male to be used for breeding to ensure that the male is structurally\nsound, free of evidence of any infectious disease, and produces a n adequate number of\nmorphologically normal spermatozoa with forward progressive motility. If a male fails\nto pass the initial breeding soundness examination, the exam should be repeated. If an\nadequate number of morphologically normal spermatozoa with for ward progressive\nmotility are not produced after the length of the spermatogenic cycle has passed (47\ndays for rams and 61 days for bulls [not including epididymal transport time]; Senger,\n2012), then it is likely that there has been substantial damage to the seminiferous\ntubules and infertility will be permanent.\nEmbryo Survival Rate\nSome of the earliest descriptive studies on in vivopre-and post -implantation\nembryonic development in cattle (Winters et al, 1942) and sheep (Green and Winters,\n1945) were performed at the University of Minnesota. These classical studies45documented the timing of normal development of a zygote as it progressed from a\none-cell fertilized egg in the oviduct to a multi -cellular free -floating embryo in the\nuterus to a fetus attac hed to the uterus by the conceptus -derived placenta.  These\nobservational data provided the benchmarks from which future studies could\nascertain the normalcy of embryonic development.\nWith the advent of reproductive biotechnologies such as in vitrofertilization and\nembryo transfer, studies on embryonic development shifted from in vivotoin vitro\nstudies.  Early attempts to maintain preimplantation embryos in vitrowere met with\nsignificant challenges. Oocytes fertilized in vitro would undergo three or few er\ncleavage divisions, and then development arrested.  This developmental arrest was\ncalled the in vitroblock to development, and subsequent studies determined the\ndevelopment block occurred due to failure of embryonic genome activation (Meirelles\net al,2004).\nEmbryonic genome activation, as the name implies, is the time period during\nembryonic development where active transcription and translation of a substantial\nnumber of genes of the embryo is initiated. This phenomenon is also known as the\nmaternal -zygotic transition for control of embryonic development. Messenger RNA\n(mRNA) and proteins stored in the oocyte at the time of ovulation control embryonic\ndevelopment up until the time of embryonic genome activation, and failure of\nembryonic genome activat ion will preclude subsequent embryonic development.\nEmbryonic genome activation can be blocked with DNA synthesis inhibitors such as \u03b1-\namanitin (Memili and First, 2000) or with, as was the case with early invitro studies,\nimproper biochemical composition of embryo culture medium.  The latter scenario\nclearly documents an important oviductal and/or uterine environmental influence on\nembryonic development.\nThere are also other interesting phenomena of preimplantation embryonic\ndevelopment in ruminants. Unlike somatic cells that undergo mitosis to produce\ndaughter cells of the same size as the parent cell, the first several cleavage divisi ons\n(mitosis) of the preimplantation embryo result in daughter cells that get progressively\nsmaller with each successive cell division. The biological reason for this phenomenon\nis to transform the oocyte \u2013which is the largest cell of the female body and possesses\n10-fold more mitochondria (the energy -producing cell organelles) than somatic cells -\ninto an entity comprised of normal -sized cells.\nAs the fertilized egg goes through mitosis (from a 1 -cell to a 2 -cell to a 4 -cell to an 8 -\ncell to a 16 -cell toa 32-cell [morula], etc.), the cytoplasm and cell organelles contained\ntherein are partitioned into the daughter cells without significant pre -division\nsynthesis of new cytoplasm and cell organelles. Such a developmental approach places\nless demand on the embryo during the early part of its development. It also enables\nthe embryo to develop inside the \u201csoft egg shell\u201d known as the zona pellucida which\nprovides physical and immunological protection to the developing embryo. This\nreduction in blastomere cell size continues until the occurrence of the first major\ndifferentiation event during preimplantation embryonic development known as\nblastulation.46The cells of the preimplantation embryo up until the time of blastulation are called\nblastomeres. Blastomeres a re totipotent, meaning they are biologically capable of\ndeveloping into a complete conceptus (fetus plus placenta), and they are also\ngenetically identical with respect to nuclear (chromosomal) DNA. At the initiation of\nblastulation, blastomeres undergo a developmental process known as compaction.\nDuring compaction, the blastomeres close down upon one another to form a tight ball\nof cells. Some blastomeres are allocated to an outer ring of cells that are held closely\ntogether via tight cell junctions, where as other blastomeres are allocated to the inner\nportion of the embryo.  As the embryo emerges from compaction, the first\nmorphological sign of differentiation is evident. The early blastocyst contains two\npopulation of differentiated cells (trophectoderm c ells and inner cell mass cells), as\nwell as a small fluid -filled cavity called the blastocoele cavity.\nIn a blastocyst stage embryo, the single cell thick layer of trophectoderm cells\ncompletely surrounds the inner cell mass cells.  The trophectoderm cells help regulate\nfluid and nutrient movement in and out of the blastocyst, and later in embryonic\ndevelopment (after the second major differentiation event [gastrulation]) the\ntrophectoderm cells contribute to the formation of the outermost layer of the plac enta\n(the chorion). The inner cell mass cells develop into the fetus proper as well as the\nremaining layers of the placenta.\nOnce the conceptus has undergone blastulation, daughter cells produced as a result of\nmitosis are the same size as their parent c ells.  As a result, the embryo begins to grow\nsubstantially larger and exerts significant mechanical pressure on the zona pellucida \u2013\nultimately causing the zona pellucida to thin and rupture. After the blastocyst hatches\nor escapes from the zona pellucida , it continues to undergo mitosis and becomes\nconsiderably larger.  At approximately day 12 -13 in sheep and day 13 -14 in cattle the\ntrophectoderm layer undergoes a period of rapid growth, and during this growth\nphase the embryo changes from a spherical to an ovoid to a tubular to a filamentous\nshape.  This embryonic metamorphosis occurs concomitantly with gastrulation and\nprecedes maternal recognition of pregnancy (Bazer et al., 1991) and subsequent\nimplantation (Bazer et al., 2011). If the ruminant embryo does not emit the signal for\nmaternal recognition of pregnancy (i.e., interferon -\u03c4), expression of the oxytocin\nreceptor gene will not be inhibited, prostaglandin F2 \u03b1will be released from the\nendometrium, the corpus luteum on the ovary will be lysed, blood concentrations of\nprogesterone will lessen, and the embryo will die.\nUnderstand ing the normal developmental process of preimplantation embryos is\nimportant because it enables a greater understanding of how perturbations in the\nprocess can result in abnormal embryonic development and/or embryonic death.\nRole of progesterone on embr yo survival\nProgesterone is a steroid hormone that is produced by the corpus luteum present on\nthe ovary of cyclic females.  Progesterone stimulates endometrial glands to produce a47nutrient-rich milieu called histotroph.  After maternal recognition of preg nancy\noccurs, blood concentrations of progesterone increase further to provide signals to\nthe endometrium to be receptive to implantation.  Progesterone is often called the\n\u201chormone of pregnancy\u201d because it is produced at high levels throughout pregnancy,\nincluding significant production by the placenta in the latter stages of pregnancy.\nThere is a growing body of evidence that blood progesterone concentrations in the\nestrous cycle before conception, as well as the estrous cycle of conception, have a\nmajorimpact on embryonic development and survival (Diskin et al., 2012; Lonergan,\n2013).  Although it has been known for quite some time that luteal insufficiency\n(leading to low concentrations of blood progesterone) in the estrous cycle during\nwhich mating occ urred can result in embryonic mortality, it is a relatively recent\nfinding that progesterone concentration on the estrous cycle immediately preceding\nthe ovulation influences embryo survival.\nA variety of management strategies has been employed in an att empt to increase\nembryo survival through exogenous hormone treatments that elevate blood\nprogesterone concentrations.  These approaches have included administration of\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the post -mating period to induce an\nadditional ovu lation and formation of an accessory corpus luteum and administration\nof supplemental progesterone via an intravaginal device such as a CIDR.  Although the\nadministration of progesterone a few days after mating tends to promote embryo\nelongation, not all s tudies have shown an impact of pregnancy rate.  Unfortunately,\nstudies have led to conflicting results due to differences in timing of treatments, some\nanimals with sufficiently high progesterone levels will not benefit from direct or\nindirect supplementat ion with progesterone, and lack of sufficient animal numbers\nand statistical power in many studies (Lonergan, 2013).\nIdentification of haplotypes impacting fertility\nOne of the exciting developments in recent years is the discovery of haplotypes in\nmajorbreeds of dairy cattle that adversely affect fertility (VanRaden et al., 2011; Fritz\net al., 2013).  (Haplotypes are a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] found\non the same chromosome and inherited together.)  These discoveries were made\npossible through the application of genomic testing of popular AI bulls and their\nmaternal grandsires.  Offspring produced from matings of carrier sires with daughters\nof carrier sires were examined to see if there was an absence of homozygous recessive\nphenotypes that would be suggestive of an embryonic lethal condition.\nWithin North America Holsteins, six different haplotypes have been identified: HH0\n(also known as brachyspina), HH1, HH2, HH3, HH4, and HH5.  These deleterious\nhaplotypes reduce conception rate from 3 to 3.5%.  Haplotypes also have been\nidentified in the Jersey and Brown Swiss breeds (VanRaden et al., 2011) that reduce\nconception rate by 3.7% and 3.4%, respectively.48The specific biological mechanisms through which these haplotypes exert an adver se\neffect on reproduction have not been elucidated.  Nonetheless, dairy cattle producers\nwould be wise to avoid mating a known carrier bull with a known or suspected carrier\nfemale.  Although one may be tempted to test and eliminate all known carrier femal es\nfrom the breeding herd, such drastic action is not warranted if the mating sire is\ndetermined to be free of the undesired haplotype prior to breeding.\nImpact of heat stress on embryonic development\nIn addition to adverse effects of heat stress on oocy te quality, elevated uterine\ntemperatures shortly after the time of insemination can reduce conception rate\n(Gwazdauskas et al., 1973). It is believed that the elevated core body temperature\nleads to embryonic death because of alteration in ovarian steroid secretion and\naltered secretions from the oviduct and uterus. The in vitroculture of bovine embryos\nat elevated temperatures disrupts normal embryonic development (Edwards and\nHansen, 1997; Rivera and Hansen, 2001; Sakatani et al., 2004) and can lead to\nembryonic death.\nThe thermosensitivity of preimplantation embryos varies as the embryo progresses\nthrough development (Hansen, 2013).  Zygotes tend to be the most susceptible to heat\nstress, and sensitivity to heat shock declines as the embryo progresses through the\nfirst few cleavage divisions.  After embryonic genome activation, the embryo develops\nthe capacity to synthesize heat shock proteins to provide short -term thermal\nprotection; however, this does not appear to be the sole mechanism though which\nthermotolerance is acquired (Hansen, 2013).  At the morula and blastocyst stages of\nembryonic development, heat stress had marginal impact on development (Edwards\nand Hansen, 1997; Eberhardt et al, 2009; Sakatani et al., 2012).  Evidence for the\ndifferenti al effect of heat stress on in vivodeveloped embryos obtained from\nsuperovulated cows also has been reported (Ealy et al., 1993).  Blastocyst yield was\nreduced in cows heat stressed on day 1 after estrus but not in cows heat stressed 3, 5,\nor 7 days after estrus.\nOne of the strategies that can potentially be employed by farmers and ranchers to\ncircumvent the reduction in fertility associated with heat stress is to utilize embryo\ntransfer.  Embryos can be harvested from donor females during times when heat\nstress is not occurring, and those embryos may be cryopreserved and stored for\nsubsequent use during periods of heat stress.\nFetal Survival Rate\nThe last step in the reproductive process is fetal survival.  Fortunately, in the absence\nof pathogenic d isease, major trauma or severe malnutrition, fetal survival is expected\nto be close to 100% in cattle. There is some evidence in sheep, however, that fetal\nlitter size may be inversely correlated with fetal survival rate (Morrical et al, 1994).49Twenty per cent of 320 ewes exhibited fetal death loss prior to day 98 of gestation, and\nthe percentage of ewes exhibiting fetal loss was 67%, 56%, 16%, and 2% for ewes\nwith initial fetal litter sizes of 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively.  Although most fetal loss\nrepresented a partial loss of the litter, further study will be needed to confirm if this\nphenomenon is exhibited across multiple years.\nConclusions\nLivestock producers face a major challenge in the years ahead to produce enough food\nto feed the burgeoning human population.  Enhancing reproductive efficiency will be\nvital to achieving increased production efficiency from ruminants.  Farmers and\nranchers must provide proper nutritional, environmental, and genetic management of\nanimals will be necessary for increas ed production of animal -derived foods.\nReferences\nKJ Anderson, DG Lefever, JS Brinks, KG Odde.  1991.

Wattiaux\nProfessor\nDepartment of Dairy Science\nUniversity of Wisconsi n, Madison, WI, 53706, USA\nSummary\nAs ruminant herbivores cattle, sheep and goats have unique evolutionary adaptions to\nhigh fiber low protein diets. However, each species has its unique features and\nabilities to thrive on stems (high fiber), leaves (high protein), or fruits/seeds (storage\ncarbohydrate) of the plants. For example, cattle have greater fiber fermentation\ncapacity then sheep and goats, and goats are the most selective feeder. A common\nfeature, however, is the ability to conserve nitrogen (N) and recycle it to the gastro -\nintestinal tract. Recent research, especially with dairy cattle indicated that high milk\nproduction can be achieved with levels of crude protein much lower than once\nthought possible. These advances may contribute to decreasing ration cost (protein\nsupplements are expensive diet ingredients) and reduce the risk of environmental\nconcerns associated with livestock production including air and water pollution and\nclimate change. A better understanding of evolutionary adaptation and feeding\nbehavior of sheep and goats in rangeland condition might offer clues to avoid or\nalleviate nutritional problems associated with intensive systems. Pasture\nmanagement and strategies of supplementation are the main factors impacting dairy\nsheep prod uction. Goats can adapt to either poor pastures or rich and balanced diets.\nIn properly balanced diet, dairy goats can be fed an all concentrate (high in by -\nproduct) diet without developing the type of digestive disturbance (rumen acidosis)\nthat would be o bserved with similar diet fed to sheep or cows.53Resumen\nMejorando la nutrici\u00f3n en vacunos lecheros y peque\u00f1os rumiantes\nComo rumiantes herb\u00edvoros, los vacunos, los ovinos y los caprinos tienen\nadaptaciones evolutivas \u00fanicas a dietas con alto contenido de fibra y bajo contenido\nde prote\u00edna. Sin embargo, cada especie tiene sus caracter\u00edsticas y habilidades \u00fanicas\npara aprovechar mejor los tallos (alto contenido de fibra), hojas (alto valor proteico),\no frutos/semillas (carbohidratos de almacenamiento) de la s plantas. Por ejemplo, el\nganado vacuno tiene una mayor capacidad de fermentaci\u00f3n de la fibra que el ovino y\nel caprino, y el ganado caprino es el m\u00e1s selectivo. Una caracter\u00edstica com\u00fan, sin\nembargo, es la capacidad de conservar el nitr\u00f3geno (N) y recicl arlo en el tracto\ngastrointestinal.

In these proceedings, we have\nattempted to provide a foundation to understand these adaptations with the premise\nthat emulating the animal\u2019s natural behavior and ecology when placed under intensive\nmanagement would contribute to efficient and economical production systems that\nminimize the risk of nutrition related disorders and the risk of environmental\npollution. Although there is a vast bod y of literature, efforts to bridge what is known\nof cattle, sheep and goat nutrition is relatively rare. In doing so, our focus will be\nmainly on nitrogen (N) utilization.\nEvolutionary Adaptations to High Fiber \u2013Low Protein Diets\nThe digestive tract of animal species has evolved to take advantage to specific feed\nresources. Herbivores consume herbaceous plant parts including stems, which are54rich in fiber and poor in nitrogen compared with leaves, which are comparatively\nricher in protein and poorer in f iber, or fruits (seeds), which concentrate nutrients in\nthe form of storage carbohydrates (starch), lipids (oilseeds), or proteins, as well as\nminerals and vitamins. The digestive tract of herbivores tends to have at least one\nvoluminous digestive compartm ent inhabited by a microbial population that has the\nenzymes to breakdown fiber (Van Soest, 1994). The fermentation of fibrous\ncarbohydrate (cellulose and hemicellulose) is a process that requires more time than\nthe digestion of simpler carbohydrates (suga rs or starch) or proteins that can be\ndigested my mammalian enzymes in the gastric -secreting stomach and the small\nintestine. Thus one of the functions of the fermentative compartment is to slow down\nthe rate of passage (i.e., increase retention time) to a llow sufficient time for the\nmicrobial population inhabiting the digestive tract to extract the energy from the\nfiber.\nThe fermentative compartment in a horse, a rhinoceros, or an elephant is the caecum\n(and the colon), which is located after the acid -secreting stomach and the small\nintestine. Thus these animals are referred to as hindgut fermenters. Other (wild)\nanimals such as kangaroo, sloth, columbus monkey or hippopotamus have a\nfermentative compartment located before the acid -secreting stomach. These animals,\nwhich do not ruminate, are referred to as foregut fermenters. In contrast, cattle, sheep\nand goat combine pre -gastric fermentation with rumination (chewing their cud) and\nhindgut fermentation. As ruminating pre -gastric fermenters, cattle, sheep, a nd goats\nbenefit from: (a) the greatest potential among all animal species to extract energy\nfrom fiber (i.e., greater fiber digestibility) and (b) a critical supply of amino acids.\nIndeed, the protein -rich microbial population that grows in the rumen whil e\nfermenting fibrous carbohydrates and other forms of carbohydrates (e.g., starch) will\neventually pass though the gastric and intestinal compartments where their digestion\nwill result in amino -acids that will be absorbed by the host.\nThe main sources of N for microbial protein synthesis are ammonia and secondarily\npre-formed amino acids (NRC, 2001). These N sources arise from the degradation of\ndietary protein and non -protein N (NPN), or the recycling of N in the form or urea,\nfrom the body of the host to the fermentative compartments of the gastro -intestinal\ntract. However, as indicated above, the protein content of the feed resources upon\nwhich herbivores rely tend to be low. Thus evolution has provided them with\nmechanisms to guarantee that microbes in their gastro -intestinal tract will be\nprovided with N needed for their growth. Compared with other animal species,\nherbivores re -route a substantial amount of urea -N to the digestive tract both with the\nsaliva they mix with the ingested (or ruminated) feed s and through the supply of\nblood to the rumen and the viscera. Urea, which is synthesized in the liver, is the end -\nproduct of N metabolism and is excreted in the urines. There is a strong relationship\nbetween blood urea N concentration and rate of urinary N excretion in mammalian\nspecies. However, the research of Kohn et al., (2005) showed that the clearance rate of\nthe kidney was lower in herbivores (cattle, sheep, goats and horses) than in pigs or\nrats, which highlighted the herbivores\u2019 ability to salvag e N before it is lost from the\nbody.55Another evolutionary mechanism that has allowed herbivores including ruminants to\nthrive on high fiber diets is body size. The total volume of the digestive tract is directly\nrelated to animal size and weight. Compared with shorter and lighter animals the\ntaller and heavier ones have longer gastro -intestinal tract, which in essence provides\nadditional time for fiber digestion as the digesting materials moves through the\ndigestive tract. The nutritional implications of th e difference in body weight between\nsheep and goats on the one hand, and cattle on the other hand, will be explored\nfurther below.\nBefore leaving the topic of evolutionary adaptation, there is one more key concept\nthat needs to be address in order to shed light on an important implication of pre -\ngastric fermentation combined with retention of fiber in the rumen and further\nprocessing by rumination. As indicated above, these physiological adaptations allow\nfor a great ability to extract energy from fiber, bu t they impose a major limitation on\nthe amount of feed the ruminant can consumed per day. Fiber is the bulky (low\ndensity) part of the plants, and thus, the selective retention of fiber in the rumen\ncreates the potential of a physical fill effect, which wi ll force the animal to slow down\nor event stop the rate of intake (kg per day) to adjust for the slow clearance rate of\nfermenting fiber from the rumen (Mertens, 1987). This phenomenon may be at the\norigin of metabolic disorders observed in early lactating ruminants, such as dairy\ncattle that have been subjected to intense genetic selection for milk production. High\nproducing cows have extremely high energy requirements in early lactation, but a\nlimited ability to increase dry matter intake due to rumen fil l limitation. Consequently\nthe cow may enter a period of negative energy balance during which body reserves\nmust be used to compensate for the lack of dietary energy intake. If not properly\nmanaged, this situation may lead to severe ketosis and fatty liver , and low fertility.\nComparative Feeding Behavior and Digestion Strategies in Dairy Cows, Sheep\nand Goats\nAs ruminants, cattle, sheep and goats have a number of similar digestive anatomical\nand physiological features, but also many differences. An obviou s difference is adult\nbody weight, which range approximately from 40 to 75 kg in sheep and goats\ncompared with 550 to 680 in beef or dairy cattle. The fact that sheep and goats are\napproximately 10 times lighter than cattle has profound implications on the ir ability\nto process dietary fiber.\nCompared with starch or other sources of carbohydrates, the utilization of the fibrous\ncarbohydrate is a process that requires long contact hours between the fiber particles\nand the microbes that inhabit the gastro -intestinal tract to provide the time needed\nfor enzymatic degradation. The fermentative capacity of the gastro -intestinal tract or\nits ability to provide sufficient time for fiber fermentation varies linearly with the\nbody weight of an animal. Heavier animal h ave longer the gastro -intestinal tract and\nlonger retention time. In contrast the amount energy required for maintenance (NEm)\nis a function of metabolic body weight (body weight to the 0.75 power; BW0.75).56Cannas (2004) quoted the work of\nINRA (Institut N ational de Recherche\nAgronomique ) French scientists to\nindicate that in sheep NEm (Mcal/d)\n= 0.0561 x BW0.75, but in cattle NEm\n(Mcal/d) = 0.070 x BW0.75. Thus\nfermentative capacity can be\ncalculated by dividing the kilos of\nfeeds that the digestive tract can\naccommodate (estimated as\nvolumetric kilograms of water to fill\nthe gastro -intestinal tract of slaughtered animals) by the calories of energy required\nfor maintenance to obtain an indication of the animal\u2019s ability to rely on fiber\nfermentation to sup port their daily energy needs. Figure 1 was constructed to\nillustrate that cattle (heavier animal) have a greater capacity than sheep and goats\n(lighter animals) to accommodate large amounts of feed in the gastro -intestinal tract\nin relation to the amount of energy required to insure basic (maintenance) body\nfunctions. Thus we can understand now why cattle can thrive on a diet that contains\nmore fiber (plant stems), compared with sheep and goats that may have to be more\nselective in choosing plant parts tha t are richer in nutrients (leaves, fruits, seeds) in\norder to meet their energy requirements.\nAlthough early ruminant nutritionists were hoping to use sheep as an model to study\ncattle nutrition (because of cost involved in doing the research), the distinc tion\nbetween sheep and cattle nutritional physiology was clearly established when Van\nSoest (1994) summarized the literature to show that sheep tended to have higher\ndigestion coefficients than cattle when fed high digestibility diets (i.e., diets low in\nfiber), but cattle tended to have higher digestibility coefficients than sheep when fed\ndiets low in digestibility (i.e., diets high in fiber). More recently Cannas (2004)\ncompared these two species and concluded that compared to cows, sheep:\n\uf0b7have to eat mo re to satisfy their maintenance requirements; and higher intake\nresults in a higher passage rate and lower fiber (forage) digestibility.\n\uf0b7tend to have more selective feeding pattern;\n\uf0b7are more affected in their intake by the particle size and the fiber conte nt of the\nforage;\n\uf0b7have to spend more time eating and ruminating each kg of feed;\n\uf0b7tend to have higher digestibility for grain and high -energy diets.\nDigestion studies comparing goats, sheep and cattle should be interpreted with\ncaution because of many pos sible cofounding factors. However the results of Uden\nand Van Soest (1982) will be used to compare them because they were offered the\nsame timothy grass as the only feed sources in the diet. Data presented in Table 1\nsummarizes dry matter intake (DMI), dig estibility and retention time of forage\nparticles. Although sheep and goats exhibited similar behavior, the greater\n57fermentative capacity of cattle (DMI, g/kg BW0.75) allowed them to consume less DM\nper unit of body weight (DMI, g/kg BW).  Furthermore the longer retention time in the\nrumen (and total gastro -intestinal tract) of cattle was associated with higher neutral\ndetergent fiber (NDF) digestibility compared with sheep or goats. Some authors,\nhowever, have argued that with forage low in nitrogen and hi gh in fiber, and not\nproperly supplemented, goats have better digestive efficiency than other ruminants\n(Tisserand et al., 1991). Greater ability to reduce particle size during chewing in\ncomparison to sheep (Hadjigeorgiou et al., 2003), higher concentrati on of cellulolytic\nbacteria in the rumen and higher efficiency of urea recycling from the blood to the\nrumen may contribute to these advantages.\nTable 1.

On the\nother hand, excess crude protein may result in both economic and environmental\nconcerns. When expensive protein supplements do not contribute to improving\nlactation performance, the excess N is lost primarily as urinary urea -N in the manure\n(Olmos Colmenero and Broderick, 2006). In many parts of the world, manure N has\nbeen associated with degradation of water in lakes and rivers, degradation of air58quality because of ammonia (NH 3) volatilization to the atmosphere, which contribute\nalso to the em ission of nitrous oxide (N 2O), a potent greenhouse gas that contribute to\nclimate change.\nTable 2 was constructed to illustrate in part the expected change in dry matter\nintake and manure production of cows producing milk in the range of 10 to 50 kg/d.\nThenitrogen balance and nitrogen use efficiency data were obtained assuming that 14\nand 17% dietary crude protein diets were provided for milk production of 25 kg/d or\nless and 30 kg/d or more, respectively. These levels of crude protein should not be\ninterpreted as \"requirements\", but rather as levels of that are likely to suffice to meet\nthe cow's requirements for amino acids, assuming other dietary nutrients, and\nespecially rumen fermentable carbohydrates are in adequate supply. The important\ntake-home mes sages in regard to N balance and N use efficiency can be summarized\nas follows:\n1.Efficiency of conversion of intake -N to milk -N ranged from 16 to 35%, which is\nto say that 65 to 84% of the N consumed by a cow is excreted in manure daily.\n2.If at first glance it appears that N use efficiency increases with milk production,\nit is true only when milk production increases at a fixed level of dietary CP. For\nexample, Table 2 data indicates that in the low production range, a cow can\nproduce twice as much milk (20 vs. 10 kg/d) and milk -N (100 vs. 50 g/d) at a\nfixed 14% dietary crude protein level simply because as the cow produces\nmore she eats more, and the increase in dry matter intake (16.7 vs. 13.6 kg/d)\nis sufficient to supply the necessary nutrients for higher milk production.\n3.Nitrogen use efficiency is a function of both level of milk production and\ndietary crude protein concentration. For example, the data in Table 2 indicated\na cow producing 25 kg of milk with a diet of 14% CP has essentially the same\nefficient as a cow producing 40 kg of milk with a diet of 17% CP (31 and 32%\nconversion rate, respectively).\n4.As illustrated by the data for milk production of 25 kg/d obtained with either a\n14 or 17% crude protein diet, at a given level of production an increase in\ndietary crude protein reduces N use efficiency (in this case from 31 to 25%),\nand increases urinary -N more (52 g/d = 184 -132) than fecal -N (36 g/d = 188 -\n152). Conversely, regardless of level of milk production, reducing dietary crude\nprotein with n o change in milk production has the beneficial effects of\nincreasing feed N use efficiency and simultaneously reducing daily excretion of\nurinary-N.\nGiven the type of properly balanced diets fed in the Midwest of the United States, milk\nproduction is gene rally not penalized, even in early lactation, when dietary crude\nprotein is approximately 16.5% of the diet (DM basis; Broderick, 2003; Wattiaux and\nKarg, 2004). Milk production of 25 kg of milk or less can be achieved with less than\n14% CP (Olmos Colmener o and Broderick, 2006). In a recent experiment, we collected\ndata with a 128 -cow trial in which  four diets with crude protein levels of 11.8, 13.1,\n14.6 and 16.2% were offered over a 12 -week period on late lactation. The average\nproduction of fat -and-protein corrected milk was 26.1, 30.0, 31.9 and 32.6 kg/d per59cow for the respective dietary levels of crude protein. The production of fat -and-\nprotein corrected milk was not significantly different when feeding the 14.6 versus a\n16.2% crude protein diet (Quaa ssdorff, et al, 2014). Important take -home messages\nfrom Table 2 in regard to the relationships among milk production, dry matter intake\nand manure excretion can be summarized as follows:\n1.Cows producing more milk must consume more feed and they produce mor e\nmanure.\n2.Regardless of milk production, cows always produce more manure than milk.\n3.As milk production increases, the amount of manure produced per unit of milk\nproduce decreases sharply. For example 4.3 kg of manure is produced per kg of\nmilk when a cow p roduces 10 kg of milk, but only 1.6 kg of manure is produced\nper kg of milk when a cow produces 50 kg of milk.\n4.Furthermore, the total amount of manure (and manure -N) excreted for a given\namount of milk depends on the number of cows needed to produce that\namount of milk. For example, 40 kg of milk produced by one cow results in 71.6\nkg of manure. In contrast the same amount of milk produced by two cows, each\nproducing 20 kg/d, would result in a total manure production of 105 kg/d (2 x\n52.5 kg/d; Table 2).\nSheep Nutrition Under Rangeland Conditions\nRangeland support a substantial proportion of the world\u2019s sheep population and play\na vital role in supporting low -cost, low -input, wool -and meat production systems\n(O\u2019Reagain and McMeniman, 2002). These authors defined rangeland as any extensive\n(unfenced), uncultivated and (or) unfertilized area that supports production of free -\nranging herbivores (limited confinement facilities), and they drew attention to the\nfollowing unique characteristics of rangeland syste ms:\n1.The carrying capacity and animal performance are low compared with more\nintensive systems (cultivated pastures). Rainfall and soil conditions are\noftentimes major limiting factors. Any management inputs must therefore be\neconomical, easy to implement a nd must have an extremely high probability of\nsubstantial return over \u201cinvestment\u201d cost.\n2.Rangelands are characterized by marked spatial and temporal (seasonal and\nyearly) variability in both forage supply and quality.\n3.Plants communities of nearly all range lands include toxic plants. Toxicity\neffects may range from subclinical depression in animal performance to\ncausing death.\n4.Drinking water is poorly distributed in rangeland and thus may severely limit\ndry matter intake and animal performance; a problem th at is rarely of any\nconcerns in conventional systems of production.\n5.Feed resources management of rangeland should be of concern because the\nloss of vegetation may have irreversible consequences in contrast to\nconventional system of production in which rese eding and fertilization may\nhelp remedy the consequence of poor management (such as overgrazing).60Sheep Nutrition Under Improved Pasture Grazing Conditions\nHerbage availability on pasture has an important impact on sheep feeding behavior.\nSummarizing the Australian literature, Weston (2002) identified three distinct\nsituations. Under high accessibility, such as with sward heights of at least 9 cm\n(corresponding to approximately 4.8 tons of dry matter per hectare), sheep have no\nproblem to maintain the lev el of intake required to meet energy requirements by\nadjusting grazing time (hr/day), bite rate (bites/ min) and bite size (grams organic\nmatter ingested/bite).  Under this situation, sheep can demonstrate preferences for\nlegume species (clover) over grass es, in part because of lower resistance of leafy\nmaterials to bolus formation and faster clearance rate from the rumen. However as\nherbage quality and availability declines and bite size decreases, sheep increase time\ngrazing and bite rate to reach the nec essary level of intake to meet energy\nrequirements. When sward height is however less than 3 cm, the ability of the sheep\nto use compensatory mechanism is no longer sufficient to maintain the desired level\nof intake. Although sheep are capable of grazing f or 13-14 hr/day, in harsh\nenvironment and sparse pasture, grazing time is often limited to 7 -9 hr/day. The\nauthor hypothesized that grazing at or near ground level may involve abrasion of the\nlips and other parts of the mouth, which in turn could have a ne gative impact on\nfeeding behavior. Furthermore, under arid conditions, the need to travel long distance\nto water may reduce time available for grazing.\nSupplementary Feeding\nBoth in temperate and rangeland environments, there are times of the year that\nnutrient demands may not be met by pasture alone given the seasonality of pasture\ngrowth. Supplementary feeding may appear as a simple concept, but it actually\ninvolves a difficult decision -making process with important implication both in term\nof biological efficiency of production and financial outcomes. There is a long list of\nelements to consider including for example, the current physiological state of the\nanimal (body reserves, state of pregnancy, etc.), the amount and nutritive value of the\npasture, th e availability and cost of supplemental feeds. Table 3 illustrates the impact\nof energy versus protein supplementation of lactating ewes grazing a perennial\nryegrass pasture of 750 -850 kg dry matter ha-1as reported in Dove et al. (1985).61Table 3.

Dove (2002) summarized the\nliterature as follows:\n1.Substitution is likely to be greater when more pasture is available. With\nabundant pasture availability (> 4.5 tons dry matter per ha), observed rate of\nsubstitution may reach approximately 67%. However a substantial\nsubstitution (~ 38%) may occur even when pasture is sparse (< 0.8 tons dry\nmatter per ha) indicating a general disinclination to graze when supplement is\nfreely available.\n2.The greater the quality of the pasture the greater the substitution rate.\nHowever, energy supplement high in starch may have a depressing effect on\nfiber fermentati on in the rumen leading to an undesirable reduction in daily\ndry matter intake.\n3.The substitution is generally greater when higher -quality supplements are fed\ncompared with lower -quality supplements.\n4.The substitution rate may be greater when greater amounts of supplements\nare fed, but there are conflicting results in the literature. The complexity of\nunderstanding the substitution behavior is illustrated with the data of a\ncontrolled experiment presented in Table 4. Increasing the restricted amount\nof supple ment increased the substitution rate. However when the supplement62was fed without restriction (ad libitum), the substitution rate was reduced in\nspite of the fact that intake of hay was reduced by 90%.\n5.The substitution rate depends also upon the physiologi cal state of the animal.\nIn general, animals with a greater demand for nutrients (e.g., lactating ewes)\nwill show lower degree of substitution than animals with lower demand of\nnutrients (e.g., pregnant ewes).\n6.The method and frequency of feeding the supple ment may influence the rate of\nsubstation.\nTable 4.

During\nthis period, lamb growth is largely determined by milk intake. Early lactation is the\nperiod of highest nutrient requirements in the ewe\u2019s whole productive cycle and\nfailure to manage the nutritional status of the ewe may imp act lamb growth\nsubstantially (Treacher and Gaja, 2002). In meat breeds selected for lamb production,\nyield at lactation peak varies between 2.0 and 4.0 kg/d, with a total three -month\nlactation yield of 150 -200 kg for ewes with twin lambs and from 90 -160 kg for ewes\nwith a single lamb.63In a number of Asian and European countries, ewe\u2019s milk has been a major source of\nanimal protein in the human diet. Furthermore, in other countries such as France,\nSpain, Greece, and increasingly in the U.S. (Thomas, 2004) dairy sheep milk is\nprocessed in expensive cheese.  There are many factors influencing milk production of\ndairy ewes. Highly selected dairy breed (East Friesian, Assaf) may have lactation\nperformance greater than 1,000 kg collected over more than 200 days of lactations,\nbut production performance lower producing dairy sheep may not be higher than\napproximately 350 -375 kg per lactation (Thomas, personal communication). The slow\nincrease in dry matter intake in early lactation means that ewes are invariably i n\nnegative energy balance for a few weeks after lambing. Managing body condition\nscore is thus an important management tool to avoid loss of milk and minimize risk of\nmetabolic disorders.\nPasture and lambing management are critical to sheep production syst ems. Aside of\noperational constraints, lambing is usually timed to coincide with the start of the\nherbage growth so that peak herbage production coincides as much as possible with\nthe period of greatest nutrient requirements of the flock. In many northern -\nhemisphere temperate pasture regions, spring lambing is constrained the timing of\nthe winter -spring transition. In intensively grazed systems, achieving a particular\nsward height in concert with fertilization and proper feed supplementation are the\nbasis of a sound management system (Treacher, 1990). In contrast in southern -\nhemisphere temperate pasture regions, winters are milder but pasture senesce in late\nspring and there is often a pressing need to minimize supplementary feeding. In this\ncase, lambing in the winter may be more appropriate that lambing in spring (Treacher\nand Gaja, 2002).\nIn a recent experiment, Mikolayunas et al., (2008) demonstrated that\nsupplementation of grazing dairy ewes with either a mixture of whole shelled corn\nand soybean pellet or shelled corn alone resulted in greater milk production\ncompared with un -supplemented ewes. Increased levels of corn supplementation\nresulted in a positive, linear increase in milk yield and an improvement in pasture\nprotein utilization, as indicated by a decrease in milk urea Nitrogen (MUN) levels.\nHowever, similarly to dairy cattle, feeding excess concentrate in the diet of dairy\nsheep may result in milk fat depression but not milk yield (Goodchild et al. 1999). This\nproblem is likely more common in int ensive dairy sheep system where high quality\nforages are expensive relative to concentrate feed, such as in Mediterranean countries.\nAs in dairy cattle,this problem may be partially corrected with the use of buffer to\nhelp maintain rumen pH near neutralit y.\nThe use of rumen undegradable protein sources in the diet of dairy ewes have\nresulted in variable results. Responses are more likely be positive in early lactation\nwhen dry matter intake has not peaked yet, and the ewes are in negative energy\nbalance. T he results of Robinson (1983) indicated a milk production response\ninversely proportional to the estimate protein degradation in the rumen. When ewes\nwere fed a basal diet of hay and barley, urea supplementation resulted in negligible\nmilk production respo nse above the approximately 2.0 kg/d of milk, but\nsupplementation with soybean and groundnut meal (70 g/d; 35 -55% ruminal64degradability) resulted in an increased milk production from to approximately 2.4\nkg/d, and supplementation with fish meal and blood m eal (60 g/d; 0 -30% ruminal\ndegradability) resulted in an increased milk production from approximately to\napproximately 2.8 kg/d. In a recent experiment conducted in Wisconsin, Mikolayunas\net al., (2009) observed a 14% increase in milk yield, 14% increase i n milk fat and 13%\nincrease in protein yield when lactating ewes were fed a diet with 12% rumen\ndegraded protein (RDP) and 6% rumen undegraded protein (RUP) compared with a\ndiet containing 14% RDP and 4% RUP or 12% RDP and 4% RUP.  Supplementation of\ndairyewes\u2019 diet with protected source of lysine and (or) methionine remain\ninconclusive. In doing so, Bocquier et al., (1994) observed an increased in protein\ncontent of milk, but Baldwin et al., (1993) found no response for either the yield of\nprotein or milk protein content.\nAdaptations and Feeding Behavior of Goats\nGoats are known for their ability to thrive on harsh environments, which would not\nsupport other grazing livestock such as cattle and sheep. Part of their adaptation\nincludes the ability to utili ze a broad range of herbacious species, shrub and trees, and\nto select from among them the material with the highest nutritive value. It has been\nshown that goats traveled longer distance in search of forage compared to sheep in\narid conditions, they tend to select more browse than do other domestic ruminants\n(Narjisse, 1991) and they consume less water per unit of intake compared with sheep\non arid lands (Tisserand et al., 1991). In contrast to earlier suggestions, goats are not\nobligatory browsers or fibr ous eaters but they rather tend to be flexible in dietary\nhabits and adjust their behavior to the availability and quality of feed resources. For\nexample goat rely heavily on herbaceous species during the growing season. Work in\nnorth Africa has shown that sheep an goats do overlap for the preference for\nherbaceous species during the spring. However during the dry season while the\ndietary contribution of grasses to sheep\u2019s diet was maintained around 70%, this\ncontribution did not exceed 32% for goats. Goats are highly selective eater, (select\nspecific plants and specific plant parts with high nutritive value) compared with sheep\nand cattle that are categorized as grass eaters with much less selective in grazing\nhabits (Van Soest, 1994). There are ample evide nce that animals of many species,\nincluding ruminants, are capable of making choices between different food source that\nprovide a more balanced diet that would be obtained by eating at random (Forbes and\nMayes, 2002).\nThe versatility of goat\u2019s feeding beha vior seems to be enabled by several anatomical\nand physiological adaptations. For example their agile and mobile upper lips allow\nthem to graze herbage as short as can the sheep, but also graze plant species with\nthorns and spine. In addition their tendenc y to assume bipedal stance provide them\nwith an advantage over other small ruminants to reach higher vegetation layers. In\naddition goats tolerate a variety of chemical produced by plants to deter grazing\nruminants from ingesting them. Examples of such com pounds include tannins,\nalkaloids, and cyanogenic glucosides. For example tannins extracted from oak leaves65stimulated rumen microbial activity and nitrogen balance in goats, but inhibited these\nfunctions in sheep (Narjisse and El Honsali, 1985). It has be en hypothesized that these\nattribute may be in part the result of higher salivary production compared with sheep\n(Narjisse, 1991).\nIn confined environment, goats have demonstrated a particular ability to discriminate\nfeeds according to their palatability. In general goats eat more slowly than sheep\nbecause of their very marked selecting behavior. In goats meals are numerous, but\nthey do not last so long.  A meal of the go ghat fed forages alone at the trough is divided\nin three phases: a phase of exploration of the feed offered, a phase of intense feed\nintake and a phase of slower intake during which the goat select the plant fractions to\ningest. They select the most nutritive fractions of forages, the leaves more than the\nstems, the thin stems from then the thick ones, the fractions richest in proteins and\npoorest in fiber.\nFeeding Dairy Goats in Intensive system\nGoats can easily adapt to intensive dairy systems. They can tolerate high amounts of\nconcentrate rich in starch but also diets with high amount of forages due to their\nefficiency in chewing and selecting feeds. In intensive dairy systems, total mixed\nration are advantageous to balance nutrient supply and to reduce feed selection.\nMoreover goats are able to eat and efficiently utilize diets without f orages as long as\nparticle size of the ration and its fiber level are carefully balanced (Rapetti and Bava,\n2008). Considering the high adaptability to different diets researcher recently tested\nthe hypothesis that the utilization of by -products or concent rates rich in fiber in\nsubstitution for forage could be useful for dairy goats. Table 5 shows diet ingredients,\nchemical composition and milk performance of Saanen goats when fed a grass -based\ndiet, a hay -based diet and a non -forage diet during the mid -lactation (Rapetti et al,\n2005). Milk production was similar, but milk fat percentage was lower for the goats\nfed the non -forage diet compared with grass -based or hay -based diets (Table 5).\nHowever, the author indicated that in a second experiment in which d ietary lipids\nwere increased in the non -forage diet, no milk fat depression was observed. An\ninteresting data of Table 5 is the significant reduction in MUN, which suggested better\nN use efficiency when goats were fed the non -forage diet compared with the grass-\nbased or the hay based diets. There are limited information on the benefits of\nincreasing rumen undegraded protein (RUP) in the diets of lactating dairy goats.\nHowever Rapetti and Bava (2008) indicated that no benefits had been observed in\ntheir own unpublished data in which soybean meal was replaced with treated canola\nmeal or in the work of Lu et al, (1990ab) in which soybean meal was replaced with\nfeather meals or meat and bone meal.66References\nASAE (American Society of Agricultural Engineers).

Weary\nAnimal Welfare Program, U niversity of British Columbia, 2357 Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada,\nV6T 1Z4 Email: nina@mail.ubc.ca\nSummary\nConcern about the welfare of dairy cattle is nothing new; producers and veterinarians\nhave always been concerned about the condition of animals in t heir care and have\ntried to ensure that they are healthy and well nourished. Although good welfare has\ntraditionally been viewed by farmers and veterinarians to be seen as good health and\nproduction there is a growing acceptance that concerns such as pain and distress and\nthe ability to engage in highly motivated behaviors is also of importance. In this\nproceedings chapter we discuss the concept of animal welfare from three different\nperspectives: biological functioning, affective state and natural behavior . Drawing\nlargely on the research undertaken by our students we provide examples of how\nscience can help provide solutions to welfare concerns that address each of these\nconcepts. Animal welfare science addresses all three types of concern by identifying\nproblems in production systems and developing solutions to these problems.  The\nbest solutions are win -win, improving the lives of cattle and the people that work with\nthem.\nResumen\nAspectos sobre bienestar animal en ganado lechero\nLa preocupaci\u00f3n por el bienestar de las vacas lecheras no es nada nuevo; productores\ny veterinarios siempre han estado preocupados por el cuidado de los animales y han\ntratado de asegurarse de que est\u00e1n sanos y bien alimentados. Aunque el bienestar ha\nsido considerado tradicion almente por los agricultores y los veterinarios como tener\nbuena salud y producci\u00f3n, hay una creciente aceptaci\u00f3n de que malestares como el\ndolor y la angustia y la capacidad de involucrarse en comportamientos altamente\nreforzados tambi\u00e9n son de importanci a. En este trabajo se discute el concepto de\nbienestar animal desde tres perspectivas diferentes: el funcionamiento biol\u00f3gico, el\nestado afectivo y el comportamiento natural.

However, more recent\ninterest in farm animal welfare stems more from concerns about pain or distress that\nthe animals might experience , and concerns that animals are kept under \u201cunnatural\u201d\nconditions, with limited space and often a limited ability to engage in social\ninteractions and other natural behaviors. Our first objective is to describe a\nconceptual framework for these different types of animal welfare concern (reviewed\nin more detail by Fraser, 2008), using examples from dairy production systems .Over\nthe past decade we have seen a tremendous increase in scientific research on the\nwelfare of cattle. Although r esearch alone cannot tell us which types of concern sare\nmost important, it can and has provided solutions to a number of issues. Oursecond\nobjective is to provide examples of how science can help provide solutions to welfare\nconcerns (these and other examples are reviewed in Rushen et al., 2008) .\nAnimal welfare: a conceptual overview\nAnimal welfare includes three types if concern: 1) is the animal functioning well\n(biological functioning), 2) isthe animal feeling well (affective state), and 3) is the\nanimal able to live a reasonably natural life (natural living; Fraser et al., 1997).  Fa rm\nanimal care givers are naturally concerned about the first category; addressing issues\nsuch as disease, injury, poor growth rates and reproductive problems, issues that are\ngood for the animal and ultimately also vital in terms of the economic viability of the\nfarm enterprise. However, people are also concerned with the affective state of the\nanimal, and focus upon whether the animals are suffering from unpleasant feelings\nsuch as pain, fear or hunger. For some people (including many producers and\nconsumers of organic products), a key concern is whether the animal is able to live a\nrelatively natural life (Fraser and Weary, 2004). For example, is the calf kept with the\ncow and do cows have access to pasture?\nThese different types of concern about animal welfare can and do overlap. A lactating\ndairy cow unable to seek shade on a hot day (natural living), will likely feel\nuncomfortably hot (affective state), and may show signs of hyperthermia and\nultimately reduced milk production (biological functioning). In such cases, research71directed at any or all the levels can help address the welfare problem. In other cases,\noverlap may be less obvious or the different concerns may even be in conflict. For\nexample, group housing of dairy calves allows them to engage in natural social\ninteractions, but when poorly managed can lead to increased incidence of certain\ndiseases or aggressive interactions. Different people can thus reach opposite\nconclusions about the relative advantages of different housing systems by favo ring\ndifferent welfare indicators (see Fraser, 2003 for case study).  Clearly the best\nsolutions will be those that address all three concerns, for example, by creating group -\nhousing systems for calves that avoid competition, allow for social contact and\nmaintains healthy calves.  In this way, the three types of concerns can be considered\nas a checklist with researchers working to identify and solve the various welfare\nissues. Below we review a few examples of recent work showing how science can be\nused to address dairy cattle welfare issues from the perspective of biological\nfunctioning, natural living and affective states.\nBiological functioning\nProblems in biological functioning, such as disease and injury, are clearly a welfare\nconcern. For example, la meness is now widely regarded as a major welfare problem\nfor dairy cows and in recent years has received considerable attention in the scientific\nliterature. Compounding the problem is that producers find it difficult to identify\nanimals at the early stage s of lameness, likely because dairy cows remain stoic unless\ninjuries are relatively severe (Whay et al., 2003).\nCurrent research is developing improved gait scoring system that can be used to\nidentify cows that are becoming lame. Better scoring systems w ill require improved\nknowledge of cows\u2019 gait, and this can be derived from computer -assisted kinematic\ntechniques that obtain precise measures of gait and how this changes with different\ntypes of hoof injuries (Flower et al. 2005). Our group uses a gait sc oring system based\non several specific gait features (e.g. asymmetric steps, tracking up etc.), and these\nscores have proven sensitive in identifying cows with sole ulcers (Flower and Weary,\n2006), pain reduction following use of local anesthetic (Rushen e t al., 2007) or non -\nsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug (Flower et al. 2008), and the advantages of softer\nwalking surfaces for lame cows (Flower et al., 2007). Improved training in lameness\ndetection, can serve to recognize which cows will benefit from treat ment, and perhaps\nmore importantly identify management and environmental factors to reduce the risk\nof cows becoming lame.\nPoorly designed and managed facilities cause injuries and increase the risk of health\nproblems including lameness and transition co w disease, arguably two of the most\nserious welfare challenges facing the dairy industry (see von Keyserlingk et al. 2009).\nProducers spend millions of dollars building indoor housing for dairy cattle, with the\naim of providing a comfortable environment fo r their animals -one that ensures\nadequate rest, protection from climatic extremes, and free access to an appropriate,\nwell-balanced diet. Despite these laudable aims, housing systems do not always\nfunction well from the perspective of the cow \u2013poorly de signed and maintained72facilities can cause injuries, increase the risk of disease, and increase competition\namong herd mates for access to feed and lying space.\nOur aim is to provide science based solutions that can facilitate better designs and\nimprovements in management that will prevent some of these problems. Our work\nhas generally evaluated housing systems from the cow\u2019s perspective by asking how\nthe housing affects cow health (e.g. by reducing the risk of hock injuries; Barrientos et\nal., 2013), wh at housing the cow prefers (Fregonesi et al., 2007; Fregonesi et al.,\n2009), and how the housing affects behavior (e.g. by reducing competition and\nincreasing feeding time; Huzzey et al. 2006).\nVariation in lameness rates can be explained in part by how the facilities are designed\nand managed, but these factors vary greatly among regions due to differences in\ntradition, barn builders, and availability of materials such as bedding. This means that\nthe factors associated with lameness also vary among region s. For example, in recent\nanalyses we have found major differences in factors associated with lameness in\nfreestall facilities between the northeastern (NE) \u2013US versus California (Chapinal et\nal., 2013). In the NE \u2013US, where many farms used mats or mattr ess with just a little\nsawdust bedding, the risk of lameness reduced by half for farms using deep bedding\nand for farms that provided some access to pasture during the dry period. In CA, all\nfarms used deep -bedded stalls (typically with dry manure bedding) and almost all\nfarms provided outdoor access (typically to a well bedded dirt lot). Under these\nconditions, rates of lameness were much lower than in the NE \u2013US. Rates of lameness\nwere lowest on farms where stalls were kept clean (i.e. not contaminated w ith feces)\nand on farms that used rubber in the alley to the milking parlour.\nUnlike lameness, hock lesions are obvious to anyone who cares to look. Indeed, it is\npretty hard to avoid noticing hock lesions when you are standing at hock level in the\nmilking parlour. But even though we can see these lesions they remain common on\nmany farms. Again, we found that prevalence varied among regions, from 42% in\nBritish Columbia, to 56% in California, to 81% in NE \u2013US (von Keyserlingk et al.,\n2012). And again, the good news is that within each region some farms had very low\nrates suggesting that others could learn from these most successful producers.\nOne of the greatest challenges is to translate science into practice.  Our recent work on\nbenchmarking lameness sh ows promise as a possible vehicle to promote the adoption\nof best practices that result in improved dairy cattle welfare (von Keyserlingk et al.,\n2012; Chapinal et al., in press). In summary, across regions, farms that use well -\nmaintained, deep -bedded sta lls have lower risk of lameness and lower rates of hock\ninjuries. Benchmarking programs that provide famers the relevant data from their\nfarms and other farms in their region can motivate farmers to change practices\nresulting in improved welfare. Farmers c an use this data, together with the\nrecommendations described here and elsewhere, to develop formulate tailor -made\nsolutions to problems with lameness and leg injuries.73Affective state\nMeasures of biological functioning, like disease and growth, can norm ally be\ncharacterized scientifically with little disagreement. The same cannot always be said\nfor measures of how animals feel. Developing validated measures of animal affect\nremains one of the most interesting and challenging problems in animal welfare\nscience.Painful procedures remain part of the everyday business of dairy farming, but\nnew scientific studies are showing ways that this pain can be reduced or avoided.\nConsiderable research has shown that all methods of dehorning and disbudding cause\npain to calves (reviewed by Stafford and Mellor, 2005) but recent research has also\nshown that hot iron dehorning an result in negative judgment bias argued to reflect\nlow mood in calves (Neave et al., 2013; Daros et al., 2014).\nIt is now also becoming clear th at use of local anesthetic alone does not fully mitigate\nthis pain. For example, local anesthetic does not provide adequate post -operative pain\nrelief. Lidocaine is effective for 2 to 3 h after administration and treated calves\nactually experience higher p lasma cortisol levels than untreated animals after the\nlocal anesthetic loses its effectiveness (Stafford and Mellor, 2005). However, the use of\nnon-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, in addition to a local anesthetic, can keep\nplasma cortisol and behavior al responses close to baseline levels in the hours that\nfollow disbudding and dehorning. A second consideration is that animals respond to\nboth the pain of the procedure and to the physical restraint. Calves dehorned using a\nlocal anesthetic still require restraint, and calves must also be restrained while the\nlocal anesthetic is administered. The use of a sedative (such as xylazine) can\nessentially eliminate calf responses to the administration of the local anesthetic and\nthe need for physical restraint du ring the administration of the local anesthetic and\nduring dehorning (Gr\u00f8ndahl -Nielsen et al., 1999). Thus a combination of sedative,\nlocal anesthetic and a non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug reduces the response to\npain during dehorning and in the hours that follow. Unfortunately, such a combination\nof treatments may not be practical for farmers and may itself have drawbacks for the\nanimal. For example, an effective local block requires repeated injections and\nadditional restraint.\nOne common alternati ve to hot -iron dehorning is using caustic paste to cause a\nchemical burn. This method of dehorning is still painful for the calves (Morisse et al.,\n1995),but thepain appears easier to control. Calves treated only with the sedative\nxylazine showed no imme diate response to application of the paste, and little\nresponse in the hours that followed (Vickers et al., 2005). Moreover, caustic paste\ndehorning combined with a sedative actually resulted in less pain to calves than\ndehorning with a hot iron combined w ith both a sedative and a local anesthetic. This\nexample shows how methods of pain treatment can be developed that are effective\nand practical for use on farm.\nIn this section we have focused on pain, in part because the science is clear but also\nbecause there is considerable social consensus regarding the ethics of intentionally74causing (or failing to prevent) pain to animals. However, we urge readers not to focus\nonly on pain; other affective states may be equally or more important to many cattle,\nincluding negative states like fear associated with poor handling practices and\nfacilities and perhaps also positive affect associated by cows suckling their calf or\ngrazing on pasture. The ability to perform these types of natural behavior are also\nconsidered i mportant in their own right, as we turn to in the next section.\nNatural living\nFor some, the natural living criteria may seem clear \u2013simply allowing animals to live\nas naturally as possible.  We see this approach as na\u00efve; some natural conditions such\nas exposure to climatic extremes, disease, parasite infections and predator attacks\ncannot be seen as good for the animals. Thus the welfare benefits of providing more\nnatural living must be assessed through the lens of the first two criteria. We use the\nexample of more natural feeding systems for calves to illustrate how research can be\nused to determine if access to more natural environments also provides benefits to\nthe animals in terms of biological functioning and affective state.\nTraditionally calves are fed milk twice daily at 10% body weight, but calves often fail\nto gain weight during the first weeks of life (Hammon et al. 2002). When provided the\nopportunity, calves consume considerably more than 10% of their body weight (de\nPassill\u00e9 and Rushen, 20 06). Calves grow much more rapidly when allowed to suckle\nfrom the dam (Flower and Weary, 2003), but this biological functioning benefit does\nto not require keeping the cow and calf together. Simply feeding more milk allows for\nmuch higher weight gains, be tter feed conversion, and reduced age at first breeding\n(Jasper and Weary 2002; Diaz et al. 2001; Shamay et al., 2005). A better\nunderstanding of the calf\u2019s natural behavior and preferences, and how allowing this\nbehavior this can benefit calf growth, is h elping to revolutionized calf feeding\npractices.\nThe milk feeding practices also affect calf hunger. Calves vocalize when hungry and\nthis vocal response, even in the first days after separation from the cow, can be much\nreduced or eliminated by providing more milk or colostrum (Thomas et al., 2001).\nCalves that are fed restricted amounts of milk from an automated calf feeder typically\nvisit the feeder more than 20 times a day even when they only receive milk on 2 of\nthese visits. Increasing the milk ration much reduces the frequency of these \u2018non -\nnutritive\u2019 visits (Jensen 2006; De Paula Vieira et al. 2008). This reduction benefits the\nother calves using the feeder by reducing feeder occupancy and competition for\nfeeder access. Thus allowing more natural fee ding behavior reduces hunger and in\nthis case also improves the efficiency of the feeding system facilitating group housing\nof calves.\nThe benefits in terms of improved growth and reduced hunger can be achieved by\nproving the calves more milk. Nipple feed ing is clearly more natural but does this\nprovide other benefits for the calf or the producer? Calves allowed to suck on a teat\nduring or after a meal show higher concentrations of cholecystokinin and insulin (de75Passill\u00e9 et al., 1993) and a greater degree of relaxation after the meal (Veissier et al.,\n2002). Group -housed milk -fed calves will sometimes suck each other (i.e. cross\nsucking), but this cross -sucking can be much reduced or eliminated if calves consume\ntheir milk ration via free access to a teat (de Passill\u00e9, 2001), likely because the sucking\nbehavior per se, rather than the ingestion of milk, is responsible for reducing sucking\nmotivation (de Passill\u00e9, 2001). Thus nipple feeding also facilitates group housing,\nsaving labor for producers (Kung et al., 2001) and perhaps providing other benefits to\nthe calves.\nFor the past decades, common wisdom among North American dairy experts was that\ncalves should be housed individually, in separate pens or hutches. This practice was\nconsidered to maximize perf ormance and minimize the risk of disease. Individual\nhousing also helps avoid behavioural problems such as competition and cross -\nsucking.\nThe new calf -feeding methods described above work well for individually housed\ncalves, but also facilitate group hous ing. Group housing provides more space for\ncalves and allows for social interactions. For the past decades, common wisdom\namong North American dairy experts was that calves should be housed individually, in\nseparate pens or hutches. This practice was consi dered to maximize performance and\nminimize the risk of disease. Individual housing also helps avoid behavioural\nproblems such as competition and cross -sucking.\nThe new calf -feeding methods described above work well for individually housed\ncalves, but also facilitate group housing. Group housing provides more space for\ncalves and allows for social interactions. Research and practical experience show that\ngroup rearing of calves can result in considerable benefits through reduced labour\nrequirements for clea ning pens and feeding. Calves are social animals that need\nexercise and keeping dairy calves in groups may provide a number of advantages to\nboth producers and their calves. Successful adoption of group housing will mean\navoiding problems such as increased disease and competition. Recent research\nprovides some insights into how these risks can be minimized.\nWe evaluated the behaviour and growth rates of calves housed in pairs versus\nindividually (Chua et al., 2002); calves gained weight steadily regardless of\ntreatments. Interestingly, during the week of weaning (approximately 5 weeks of age),\npair-housed calves continued to gain weight normally but the individually housed\ncalves experienced a slight growth check. There were no differences between groups\ninthe amounts of milk, starter or hay consumed, or in the incidence of scouring or\nother diseases. Aggressive behaviour and cross -sucking were almost never observed\n(less than 0.2% of time).\nIn a more recent study, De Paula Vieira et al. (2010) found that calves housed in pairs\nvocalized less during weaning than did individually housed calves. The results of this\nstudy also illustrated some longer -term costs to housing calves individually. When all\ncalves were eventually introduced to a group pen after wea ning calves that had76previously been single housed took on average 50 h to begin feeding, in comparison to\njust 9 h for the pair -reared calves. Calves are also able to learn a simple colour\ndiscrimination task, and then re -learn the task when the colour tr eatments were\nreversed. However, despite the speed of learning for the simple discrimination task\nbeing similar for individually housed and pair -housed calves, the pair -housed calves\nare able to adapt more easily when the training stimuli are reversed. Tog ether, the\nresults of these studies suggest that individual housing of dairy calves can result in\nmeasurable learning deficits. Social housing for calves may result in animals that are\nmore flexible in their responses to changes in management and housing ( de Paula\nVieira et al., 2012; Gillard, et al., 2013).\nSuccessful group rearing requires appropriate management, including feeding method\nand group size. Large epidemiological surveys of U.S. and Swedish dairy farms found\nincreased mortality and disease o n farms keeping calves in large groups (more than 7\nor 8) (Losinger and Heinricks, 1997). Thus, small groups are likely a better alternative\nthan large ones.\nCalf immunity and the design and management of the housing systems, such as its\ncleanliness and v entilation, likely affect disease susceptibility more than group\nhousing per se. Our work shows that housing young dairy calves in small groups is\nviable in terms of calf health, performance and behaviour. New research is now\nrequired on management strateg ies that will help prevent disease. For now, we\nencourage producers to consider keeping a closed herd (i.e. no new animals entering\nthe herd), keeping groups small and physically separated from one another (e.g. in\nsuper hutches), and managing group pens i n an all-in-all-out basis.\nCalves in groups sometimes compete with pen mates. In one experiment using a\nsimple teat -feeding system, we found that group -housed calves can displace one\nanother from the milk teat many times each day if there are not enough t eats (von\nKeyserlingk et al., 2004). However, giving each calf access to its own teat greatly\nreduced these displacements. This improved access to teats resulted in longer feeding\ntimes and increased milk intakes.\nOther research has focused on how compute rized feeding stations can be managed to\nreduce competition between calves. Increasing the daily milk allowance for calves\nfrom 5 to 8 litters per day reduced by half the number of times calves visited the\nfeeder, reducing occupancy time and displacements from the feeder, and improving\nthe efficient use of this equipment (Jensen and Holm, 2003; de Paula Vieira et al. 2008;\nSweeney et al., 2010). Our research shows that young calves can be introduced into a\ngroup with little disruption when they are trained to feed from the computerized\nfeeding station prior to the introduction (O\u2019Driscoll et al., 2006). Although the calves\nvisited the feeder less frequently on the day of mixing, they were able to compensate\nby increasing both the duration and amount consumed per meal, and established their\npre-mixing feeding pattern after just one day.77Conclusions\nMany in the dairy industry may have assumed that animal welfare concerns can be\nmet by working to ensure good health and productivity for the cows and calves in\ntheir care. We have argued above that good biological functioning is a necessary\ncomponent of welfare, but this focus alone is not sufficient; affective states like pain or\nhunger, and concerns about naturalness are also important. Animal welfare science\naddresses all three types of concern by identifying problems in production systems\nand developing solutions to these problems.  The best solutions are win -win,\nimproving the lives of cattle and the people that work with them.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank our colleagues, especially David Fraser, Jeff Rushen and Anne Marie de\nPassill\u00e9 and the many students in the Animal Welfare Program that helped develop\nthese ideas.

Farm animal\nwelfare standards and expectations differ greatly between regions of the world. The\nEuropean Union has a plethora of law that covers housing systems, care and\nmanagement p ractices. The United States are somewhat in -between, with two federal\nlaws, and a few states outlawing certain housing practices. On the opposite end of this\nspectrum, developing countries have little to no on -farm animal welfare standards.\nHowever, farm a nimal welfare as it relates to the multilateral trade policy framework\nhas been the subject of global discussion. Recently, private standards and specifications\nas it relates to on farm animal welfare and effects on international trade in animal\nproducts h as further stimulated interest in consistency from the World Trade\nOrganization. It is not a case of \u201cif\u201d but \u201cwhen\u201d farm animal welfare trade disagreements\nwill occur, and farmers, scientists, funding agencies and policy makers must continue to\nwork toget her so that on -farm animal welfare and global trade in animal protein can\ncontinue in harmony.\nResumen\nComportamiento y bienestar animal\nEl bienestar animal es un t\u00e9rmino global que tiene como objetivo cuantificar c\u00f3mo un\nanimal est\u00e1 funcionando, sintie ndo y si el animal puede vivir \"relativamente\" una vida\nnatural. Est\u00e1ndares y expectativas de bienestar de losanimales de granja difieren\nmucho entre las regiones del mundo. La Uni\u00f3n Europea tiene una pl\u00e9tora de leyes que\ncubre los sistemas de alojamiento , cuidado y pr\u00e1cticas de manejo. Los Estados Unidos\nest\u00e1n en un t\u00e9rmino medio, con dos leyes federales, y con algunos estados que proh\u00edben\nciertas pr\u00e1cticas de alojamiento. En el extremo opuesto de este espectro, los pa\u00edses en\ndesarrollo tienen poco o ning una norma de bienestar animal en las explotaciones. Sin\nembargo, el bienestar animal y su relaci\u00f3n con el marco multilateral de la pol\u00edtica\ncomercial ha sido tema de debate mundial. Recientemente, las normas privadas y\nespecificaciones , as\u00ed como su relaci\u00f3 n con el bienestar de los animales de granja y los\nefectos sobre el comercio internacional de productos de origen animal han estimulado,\na\u00fanm\u00e1s,el inter\u00e9s por suconsistencia e nla Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial del Comercio. No es\nun caso de \"si\" sino de \"cu\u00e1ndo\" se producir\u00e1n desacuerdos comerciales de bienestar de\nlos animales de granja , as\u00edganaderos, cient\u00edficos, instituciones financieras y los\nresponsables de la elaboraci\u00f3n de pol\u00edticas deben seguir trabajando juntos para que el82bienestar de los animales de g ranja y el comercio mundial de prote\u00edna animal puedan\ncontinuar en armon\u00eda.\nPoultry and swine behavior and welfare challenges\nPoultry and swine behavior and welfare continues to be under scrutiny (Johnson,\n2008). Housing for both species has been a majo r challenge, specifically conventional\ncages for the laying hen and gestation stalls for swine (McGlone et al 2004; Bas -\nRodenburg et al 2005). Predominate criticisms for the conventional cages has been\nthe lack-and quality of space (Mench and Blatchford, 2014), no perches (Donaldson et\nal 2012), no nest boxes (Riber and Nielsen, 2013) and no ability to dust bath (Appleby\net al 1993). Another criticism towards this housing has been levied at the inability of a\nhen to escape during aggressive interactions (S himmura et al 2010). Conversely\ncriticisms to the gestation stall include the inability of the sow to form social\nrelationships (Pitman -Elmore et al 2011), lack of space (Li and Gonyou, 2007),\ndetrimental effects on bone and muscle strength (Marchant and B room, 1996) and the\nlack of biologically relevant environmental enrichment (Elmore et al 2012). More\nrecently, concerns have centered on how much pain an animal experiences, how to\nmanage pain and euthanasia techniques. Pain can be inflicted during routine\nprocedures, for example beak trimming in the hen (Gentle, 2011), or castration, tail\ndocking and teeth re -sectioning in the piglet (Hanssen et al 2011; Sutherland et al\n2012). Classical work by Danbury and others (2000) concluded that severely lame\nbroilers will self -medicated with a non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug, indicating\nthat animals do perceive pain and will seek pain relief. However, in the U.S. s cience-\nbased guidance for the industry on optimal housing, management and treatment of\nlame birds and pigs is deficient. In addition, there are no approved drug treatments\nfor lame swine analgesia, and the identification and validation of robust, repeatable\npain measurements is fundamental for the development of effective analgesic drug\nregimens and ma nagement strategies (AVMA; 2010; FDA, 2010). At Iowa State\nUniversity work on the lame sow (Karriker et al 2013), pain management (Pairis -\nGarcia et al 2013; Pairis -Garcia et al 2014) and the use of objective tools (Tapper et al\n2013; Mohling et al. 2014a,b ), will provide scientific data to help the FDA in the area of\npain management. As regards euthanasia, the most predominant U.S. method for non -\nviable piglet euthanasia (less than 5 kg [12 lb.]) is manually applied blunt force\ntrauma (Ma -BFT). Manually app lied blunt force trauma is one of several euthanasia\ntechniques considered acceptable or conditionally acceptable by the most recently\npublished guidelines from the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA).\nHowever, Ma -BFT is being criticized on the basis of aesthetics, impacts on those\nperforming the procedure, and the ability to produce humane euthanasia consistency.\nSwine producers, veterinarians and animal scientists generally agree that euthanasia is\nthe best choice for low viability piglets, esp ecially when there is suffering due to injury\nor illness but research on humane options for this classification of pig is needed. Work\nat Iowa State University has been addressing euthanasia of the low viable piglet (Sadler\net al 2014a) and the use of gas (Sadler et al 2014b). This data will be critical as the\nAVMA and U.S. swine industry update their recommendations and policies.83Poultry and swine welfare: Functioning, feeling and a natural life\nAnimal welfare is an all -encompassing term that aims to q uantify how an animal is\nfunctioning, feeling and if the animal can live a \u201crelatively\u201d natural life (Fraser et al\n1997). Traditionally, producers, veterinarians and animal scientists have studied,\nmeasured and addressed challenges that fall into the funct ioning category. Using the\nPork Quality Assurance (PQA\u00ae) Program\u00aeas an example, questions that are used\nduring on -farm assessment include \u201c is the body condition score (BCS) for healthy\nanimals in the breeding herd 1% or less BCS 1 ?\u201d or \u201care pigs euthanize d in a timely\nmanner?\u201d However, consumers, scientists and groups with an interest in farm animal\nagriculture and particularly animal welfare, are also concerned with how an animal is\nfeeling or coping in agricultural systems. In the presence of humans, far m animals can\ndisplay behaviors/postures that have been frequently labeled as fear or fear\nresponses, and these negative affective states are of particular importance to measure\nand manage. For example, in the Welfare Quality Assessment Program (2009) usin g\nsows as an example, the assessors are asked to \u201c classify social behaviour (positive\n[rooting, sniffing, licking etc] and negative [aggression]) or other (resting) .\u201d This\nsecondary category has been more challenging to make sure that data is collected in a\nuniform way, over a variety of housing systems, and that the interpretation is correct.\nFinally, for some entities, the ability of the animal to live a relatively natural life is\nextremely important. Global markets have animal produce that relates to nat ural\nliving. These are marketed as \u201cniche\u201d, \u201corganic\u201d and or \u201cfree -range\u201d. In the U.S.\nWholefoods have a 5 -step animal welfare rating standards. In their chickens raised for\nmeats standards it is noted that \u201c all chickens from 4 -weeks of age must be given\ncontinuous access to the outdoors during daylight hours if climatic conditions do not\npose welfare risk\u201d These three areas of animal welfare do overlap for example, a free\nranging hen unable to find a shelter from a cold wind would likely feel cold and show\nsigns of shivering (feeling) and perhaps reduced egg production (functioning).\nConversely, grouped housed gestation sows at mixing will engage in intense\naggression until the hierarchy for that pen has been established, but a static pen of\ngestating sows whose hierarchy has been established can live in relative harmony.\nThere are discrepancies in the use of functioning, feeling and animals living a\nrelatively naturally life in farm animal welfare educational, assessment, third party\nauditing and law at the global scale. For example, the PQA Plus and the swine third\nparty audit in the U.S. do not measure and report a human -animal interaction test, but\nthe Welfare Quality Assurance Program from the European Union (EU) does (Welfare\nQuality, 2009; NPB, 2013; 2 014). Hence differing weights of importance have been\nplaced into these three areas of welfare that in turn reflect the outcomes measured\nwithin a countries farm animal welfare programs. This makes hypothetically using\nanimal welfare as a trade barrier mor e complicated.\nAnimal behavior, welfare and trade\nAnimal-welfare legislation in Europe and in several U.S. states has outlawed the use of\nparticular housing systems. Currently, such legislative efforts may have only a limited\neffect on farm animal welf are, so long as consumers continue to demand, and are84supplied with, products imported from other nations or states lacking similar farm\nanimal-welfare laws. International trade represents a special challenge for farm\nanimal-welfare legislation. As the Eur opean Commission noted, \u201cAnimal welfare\nstandards, notably those concerning farm animal welfare, could be undermined if there\nis no way of ensuring that agricultural and food products produced to domestic animal\nwelfare standards are not simply replaced by imports produced to lower standards \u201d\n(European Commission, 2002). An example of this came through the United Kingdom\npassing a ban on sow gestation stall and tether use in 1999, yet the rest of the\nEuropean Union did not ban these practices until 2013. Co nsequently, the United\nKingdom pork costs increased and imports of fresh and frozen pork products\nincreased by 77%. In 2005, more than half of all pork products in British\nsupermarkets were imported, and more than two -thirds of these imports were\nproduced using systems illegal in the United Kingdom (British Pig Innovation, 2006).\nThe European Union has not yet attempted to restrict imports from countries that do\nnot meet its farm -animal welfare legislation standards. However, if such an attempt\nwas made oth er non-European countries would likely submit formal complaints.\nTrade disagreements can be made through the multilateral trade policy framework\nwhich comprises of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947 (GATT), the\nAgreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) and the\nAgreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). These Agreements are a set of rules\nthat must be respected by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and they should not\narbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between countries where identical or similar\nconditions prevail (WTO, 2014a). Animal welfare as it relates to these WTO rules has\nbeen the subject of global discussion. Recently, private standards and specifications as\nit relates to on farm animal welfare and the effect this has had on international trade\nin animal products has further stimulated interest in the question of WTO consistency\n(Kahn and Varas, 2014). Protecting compliant producers from unfair competition with\nnon-compliant producers will depen d upon allowing one or more of the following:\nanimal-welfare considerations in Article III or Article XX of GATT, international\nstandards, labeling, tariffs, and Green Box provisions. Article III of GATT states that\nimported products should be treated no l ess favorably than \u201c like products \u201d of domestic\norigin (GATT, 1947). Disagreement has focused on the interpretation of \u201c like products \u201d\nwhich, in past WTO disputes, have been understood as \u201c directly competitive or\nsubstitutable products \u201d (Raj and Gantz, 2005 ). For instance, the WTO may not permit a\nnation to restrict imports of cage eggs while it allows production of cage -free eggs,\nwhich are physically identical. However, because consumers concerned about animal\nwelfare do not view such products as substitut able, there may be room for\ndifferentiating products according to process and production methods (PPM). No\nGATT rule explicitly forbids PPM distinctions, and the criteria for what constitutes\n\u201clike products \u201d continues to evolve in WTO case law (WTO, 2014b) . If the WTO Council\nestablishes an interpretive rule accepting PPM distinctions, the European Union could\nrestrict imports that do not comply with its domestic regulations.\nThe Agreement most likely to be used for such dispute settlements would be the\nAgreement on the Application of SPS Measures that sets out the basic rules for food\nsafety and animal and plant health standards. These are as follows, to;85\uf0b7Protect human or animal life from risks arising from additives, contaminants,\ntoxins or disease -causing organisms in their food;\n\uf0b7Protect human life from plant -or animal -carried diseases;\n\uf0b7Protect animal or plant life from pests, diseases, or disease -causing organisms;\n\uf0b7Prevent or limit other damage to a country from the entry, establishment or\nspread of pes ts.\nThe SPS Agreement also recognizes the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE;\n2014), the International Plant Protection Convention and the Codex Alimentarius\nCommission as the reference international standard -setting organizations animal\nhealth an d zoonotic diseases, plant health and food safety (Kahn and Varas, 2014).\nAnimal health is clearly linked to better animal welfare. However, extensive livestock\nproduction systems which have been advocated as providing superior animal welfare\n(Wholefoods, 2014) may have increased health challenges through predation, exposure\nto pathogens, temperature extremes and other environmental contaminants (Quintern\nand Sundrum, 2006; Kijlstra et al 2009). Developing countries may view the European\nUnion\u2019s animal welf are proposals as disguised protectionism. However, developing\ncountries do have strengths as regards on farm animal welfare, (1) it is seen as a value -\nadding attribute for some exporting developing countries (Bowles et al 2005) (2) farms\ntend to be smaller and not considered concentrated -animal-farming-operations (CAFO)\nand (3) developing countries are still in the early stages of creating welfare assurances\nthat can be built in a flexible manner to meet the market specifications. These\nassurances can be cr eated through law and legislation, educational, assessment -and\nthird party auditing programs (Grandin 2007; Hemsworth et al 2009; Johnson 2008).\nU.S. law and legislation\nFood animal production government regulations are a common practice for European\nUnion livestock and poultry producers. The transition had both controversy and\neconomic cost. In contrast, U.S. livestock and poultry producers have been relatively\nfree of mandatory animal welfare standards that address the way food animals can be\nhoused u ntil recently (Swanson, 2008). The first legislation involving food animal\nwelfare was the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (1958) which set forth to \u201cto\nestablish the use of humane methods of slaughter of livestock as a policy of the United\nStates, and for other purposes.\u201d The Act covers animal ante -mortem handling and the\nslaughter process itself. It requires animals be made insensible to pain by \u201c a single blow\nor gunshot or an electrical, chemical or other means that is rapid and effective \u201d prior to\nbeingshackled, hoisted or cut. The humane slaughter act requires that cattle, calves,\nhorses, mules, sheep, swine, and other livestock be stunned before slaughter. The\nnation\u2019s humane slaughter laws currently do not cover poultry. The second federal\nregulation , called \u201cThe 28 -hour Law\u201d, originally passed in 1873 (49 U.S.C. 80502, last\namended in 1994; 2005 to include road), notes that many animal transport vehicle\ntypes \u201cmay not confine animals in a vehicle or vessel for more than 28 consecutive hours\nwithout u nloading the animals for feeding, water, and rest.\u201d In the past decade however,\nthere has been a monumental shift in state law that mandates how animals can be86housed. For example, the following states have outlawed the use of individual stalls for\nthe gestation sow; FL, AZ, OR, CA, CO, ME, MI and OH (Johnson, 2008).\nThird party auditing\nThird party auditing programs provide an additional verification to the customer and\nconsumer that products for human consumption are cared for following program\nspecifications (Johnson, 2008). In the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand,\napproximately 90% of large beef and pork slaughter plants are audited by major\ncustomers (Grandin, 2007). Recently in the U.S. the National Pork Board released an\nindustry on -farm third party auditing program. The program will use the existing Pork\nQuality Assurance\u00aePlus (PQA Plus\u00ae) program as its foundation and expand on it to\nserve as a common audit platform for the pork industry. The overarching goal of the\ncommon audit process is to provide consumers greater assurance of the care taken by\nfarmers and pork processors to improve animal care and food safety. The common\nplatform seeks to create and standardize a common process that will: (1) meet\nindividual company and customer needs, (2) focus on outcome -based criteria that\nmeasure animal welfare, (3) provide clarity to producers with regard to audit standards\nand expectations, (4) minimize duplication and prevent over -sampling and (5) ensure\ngreater integrity of the audit process thr ough consistent application. The new common\naudit framework has several key components, including a new audit tool, requirements\nfor auditor training and biosecurity and a platform that will allow audit results to be\nshared to prevent duplicative audits. T he audit tool is currently being beta -tested on\nfarms across the U.S. (NPB, 2014).\nAssessment programs\nAnimal welfare assessment programs provide customers and consumers with\nassurance that the food products they purchase and consume are derived from\nproduction systems where the animals are monitored and evaluated according to an\norganizations published standards. These programs focus to ensure transparency,\ncreditability, and accountability for the methodologies utilized in managing food\nproducing animal s (Johnson, 2008). On -farm welfare assessment involves the practical\nevaluation of animal state, defined as health, performance, physiological, behavioral,\nand cognitive functions under commercial farm conditions. On -farm welfare assessment\nmeasures can be broadly divided into animal -and resource -based. Resource based\nmeasures are usually indirect measurements of animal welfare, for example production\nmeasures such as feed/gain ratio, body weight gain, and space allowance (AMI, 2010;\nNCC, 2014; NMPF, 2013; NPB, 2013; NTF, 2012) and the environment i.e. penning\nintegrity, feed and water structures. Animal based resources are considered more direct\nmeasurements of animal welfare, and include body condition scoring (NCBA, 2010;\nNMPF, 2013; NPB, 2013), hygiene scoring (NMPF, 2013), slips and falls (AMI, 2010;\nNCBA, 2010; NPB 2013), broken and dislocated wings, broken legs (NCC, 2014),\ngait/lameness scores, (NCC, 2014; NMPF, 2013; NPB, 2013) hoof and hock lesions\n(NMPF, 2013; NPB, 2013), and vocalizations (AMI, 2 010; NCBA, 2010).87Numerous animal -based measures can be collected, for example body condition score,\nlameness severity, abscesses, wounds, and lesions. Wounds and lesions are collated and\nreported because when farm animals are socially housed, behavioral challenges can\noccur, that in turn can affect individual welfare. One example of a behavioral challenge\nin socially housed animals is aggression. The term \u201caggression\u201d is a very broad category,\nthat can result from a variety of causal factors; i.e. aggress ion around the time of\nreproduction (Ewing et al 1999), parent to off -spring (Ahlstr\u00f6m et al 2002; Marchant -\nForde, 2002; Harris et al., 2003) and social which can include fighting within newly\nformed-or established groups (Anderson et al 1999; Arey 1999; Gabor et al 1999;\nMarchant -Forde and Marchant -Forde, 2006). Factors that affect the level, intensity and\nfrequency of social aggressive interactions are numerous, can include, but are not\nlimited to, the quality and quantity of space, number of resources p er pig (i.e. feeders\nand drinkers), placement of resources, number of animals in a group and how the\nstructure of the group has been formed. A more challenging animal -based measure in\nassurance programs is the animal -human relationship (Hemsworth and Barne tt 1991).\nPrevious animal -human paradigm tests have included the open field -(Morm\u00e8de et al\n1984), novel object approach -, and human approach tests (Hemsworth et al 1996;\nRushen et al 1999; Grandin 2007; Pairis et al 2009; Colpoys et al 2014). Fangman and\ncolleagues (2010) coined the term \u201c willingness -to-approach \u201d as a positive alternative to\nfear that describes nursery pig approach behavior elicited by a human observer in the\nhome pen. Regardless of the animal -human paradigm test used, the methodology must\nbe repeatable, objective, meaningful, and fast. The person conducting the test must be\nable to interpret the findings correctly and hence understand the animal species\u2019\nnormal behavioral patterns within a specific environment (Wailblinger et al 2006).\nFinally, this on -farm animal -human paradigm test should provide consistent results\nregardless of the environment that the animals are housed in, size of enclosure or global\nregion of the world. Forkman and co -workers (2007) have suggested that the first\nanimal response to a novel -or unfamiliar object is the most accurate. If digital\ntechniques can be utilized to capture an image of animals within a pen at a given time\npoint, then postural classification and precise proximity from the human observer could\nbe determined, and hence provide a more objective and repeatable result for animal -\nhuman paradigm tests on -farm. Work at Iowa State University has tried to provide\ninformation on this animal -human interaction during on -farm welfare assessments. A\nnursery-pen image capturing device was developed (Figure 1) and we were able to\ncompare a human observer and the digital image for nursery pig -human interaction\nmeasures (Figure 2).88Figure 1: Nursery-pen image capturing\ndevice (Weimer et al 2012)\nFigure 2: Swinepostures and behaviors\nthat were collected digitally to determine\nthe animal -human relationships during an\nassessment ( Weimer, 2012)\nFindings from this work noted that there were no differences in pigs classified as Touch,\nOrientated and Not Orientate d to the human in the pen between methodologies. We\nconcluded that this animal -human based methodology showed promise for inclusion\ninto on-farm welfare assessment programs. In addition this test has indicated\nrobustness (Weimer, 2012), regardless of farm size (family vs. corporate) and\ngeographical location (developed vs. developing countries). This is an important finding\nfor swine producers because if this animal -based measure was required in a country\u2019s\nwelfare standards, it may allow them continued or new access to local, regional and\nglobal markets.\nConclusions\nAssuring on -farm animal behavior and welfare will continue to be interwoven in future\ndiscussions as it relates to national and global trade. These discussions must include a\nvariety of stake holders involved in animal production. It is vital that countries are\ndeveloping and/or improving their farm animal welfare options that can assure other\ncountries that humane care is forefront in daily business decision making. Developing\ncountries must b e at these discussions to present their views and concerns and to help\nshape the future. Creation of farm animal welfare options must not be cost prohibitive,\ncontent should be based on sound science, the measures must be meaningful and the\nresults and pro cesses be transparently communicated.

Gabler\nDepartment of Animal Science\nIowa State University, Ames, IA, 50011, USA\nSummary\nIn recent years, muc h attention has been given to feed efficiency (FE) in swine and\npoultry production due to the rising costs of feed and other inputs. The main\nbiological factors that contribute to differences in FE include physical activity, feed\nintake patterns and behavi our, environmental (climate, nutritional and\nimmunological) stress, nutrient and energy digestibility and efficiency of utilization,\ncomposition of gain and metabolism. In other words, both the maintenance and\ngrowth components of nutrient and energy utili zation can be involved. Strategies to\nimprove growth and FE of poultry and swine can be achieved with the use of feed\nadditives that regulate and improve gastrointestinal function, health and integrity.\nWith the recent volatility of traditional feed ingred ients such as corn, wheat, soybean\nmeal and canola meal, the swine and poultry industries have moved towards\nalternative cost -effective feed ingredients such as cereal co -products from biofuel and\nmilling industries. However, the ability of mongastric spe cies to fully utilize and\ncapture the nutrients and energy out of these cereal co -product feed stuffs is limited\nby their gastrointestinal tract endogenous enzyme production and anatomy. To\ncompensate for this, over the past decade there has been an increa se in the use of\nexogenous enzymes (EE) in diet formulation to facilitate improved energy and\nnutrient utilization. Additionally, the use of pre -and probiotics, organic acids,\nmycotoxin binders and other functional ingredients have been used to promote\ngastrointestinal health and function. This paper will cover the use of conventional and\nalternative feed stuffs in swine and poultry nutrition. In particular, the contributions\nof bioactive nutrients and exogenous enzyme (EE) usage in monogastric diets that\nfacilitate intestinal health and function will be discussed.\nResumen\nManejo nutricional para maximizar la eficiencia alimentaria y la\nperformance productiva\nEn los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, se ha prestado mucha atenci\u00f3n a la eficiencia alimenticia (EA) en\nla produc ci\u00f3n de cerdos y aves de corral debido al incremento de costos de los96alimentos y otros insumos. Los principales factores biol\u00f3gicos que contribuyen a las\ndiferencias en la EA incluyen la actividad f\u00edsica, los patrones y comportamientos de\nconsumo, el estr \u00e9s ambiental (climatol\u00f3gico, nutricional e inmunol\u00f3gico), la\ndigestibilidad y la eficiencia de utilizaci\u00f3n de nutrientes y energ\u00eda ,la composici\u00f3n de\nla ganancia y el metabolismo. En otras palabras, tanto los componentes de\nmantenimiento y crecimiento en l a utilizaci\u00f3n de nutrientes y energ\u00eda pueden estar\ninvolucrados . Estrategias para mejorar el crecimiento y la EA de las aves de corral y\ncerdos se pueden lograr con el uso de aditivos que regulan y mejoran la funci\u00f3n, la\nsalud y la integridad gastrointesti nal. Con la reciente volatilidad de los insumos\ntradicionales como el ma\u00edz, el trigo, la harina de soya y la harina de canola, las\nindustrias de  porcinos y aves de corral se han movido hacia el uso de insumos\nalternativos rentables tales como subproducto s de cereales de lasindustrias\nbioenerg\u00e9ticas y de molienda. Sin embargo, la capacidad de las especies\nmonog\u00e1stricas para utilizar plenamente y capturar los nutrientes y la energ\u00eda de estos\nsubproductos de cereales est\u00e1 limitada por su anatom\u00eda y porla producci\u00f3n de\nenzimas end\u00f3gen as del tracto gastrointestinal . Para compensar esto, en la \u00faltima\nd\u00e9cada se ha producido un aumento en el uso de enzimas ex\u00f3genas (EE) en la\nformulaci\u00f3n de dietas para facilitar una mejor utilizaci\u00f3n de nutrientes y energ\u00eda.\nAdicionalmente, los pre y probi\u00f3ticos, \u00e1cidos org\u00e1nicos, secuestradores de\nmicotoxinas y otros ingredientes funcionales se han utilizado para promover la salud\ny la funci\u00f3n gastrointestinal. En este trabajo se discutir\u00e1 el uso de insumos\ntradicionales y alter nativos en la nutrici\u00f3n porcina y de aves de corral. En particular,\nse discutir\u00e1n los aportes del uso de nutrientes bioactivos y enzimas ex\u00f3genas (EE) en\nlas dietas de monog\u00e1stricos que facilitan la salud y la funci\u00f3n intestinal.\nBiological factors drivin g feed efficiency\nTogether with growth rates (average daily gain; ADG), days to market and mortality,\nfeed efficiency (FE) is considered one of the most important parameters in swine and\npoultry production to assess. As such, imp roving FE is a major objec tive in swine and\npoultry production due to the rising costs of feed and the need to enhance overall\nproduction efficiency and profitability. Feed efficiency is not a directly measureable\ntrait; however, it is typically used to describe variation in weight gain with respect to\nfeed input. The traditional measurements of FE include the ratios body weight\ngain:feed intake (G:F) or feed intake:body weight gain (feed conversion ratio, FCR).\nDue to the economic importance of FE and the increase pressure for sele ction of lean\ncarcasses (swine) and faster growth rates (swine and poultry), FCR trends have\ndecreased over the last few decades due to genetic selection and improved nutrition\nand environmental management strategies.97While is it known that the key facto rs contributing to FE differences are similar across\ndifferent breeds and species due to selection for similar genetic parameters and\nproduction traits, the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms are poorly\ndescribed. However, the main biologica l factors that may contribute to differences in\nFE have been partially quantified in poultry (Luiting, 1990 ), pigs(Barea et al., 2010 ),\nand beef cattle (Richardson and Herd, 2 004).  These key factors have been\nsummarized (Figure 1) and include physical activity, feed intake patterns and\nbehaviour, stress, body composition, nutrient digestibility, protein turnover, and\nmetabolism (Richardson and Herd, 2004 ;Herd and Arthur, 2009 ). Biologically,\nalthough all these factors contribute to the variation associated with FE, dietary\nstrategies to improve animal health, nutrient and energy digestibility have had some\nsuccess. With the advances in biotechnology, exogenous feed enzymes, mycotoxin\nbinders and gut modifiers have shown some promise in aiding in improving poultry\nand swine FE.\nIntestinal health and function\nSignificantly contributing to the production efficiencies of poultry and swine is the\nmaintenance and improvement in gastrointestinal tract (GIT) health. Therefore, the\nuse of dietary ingredients to improved monogastric GIT f unctions and health is not a\nnew concept. The lumen of the GIT is considered a space outside the body because of\nits continuity with the external environment. It has the arduous task of absorbing the\nnutrients that are essential for\nthe organism while prev enting\nthe absorption of substances\nthat are not needed and\nharmful to the system. The GIT\nprimarily serves two important\nfunctions: 1) Selectively\nabsorbing nutrients, vitamins,\nminerals and water from the\nlumen; and 2) Forming a\nphysical barrier between the\nluminal contents and systemic\ncirculation. A single layer of\nintestinal epithelial cells which\nline the intestine selectively\nabsorbs most of the nutrients\nneeded through active and\npassive processes with the help\nof specific transport or carrier prote ins. For example, glucose and fructose are\nabsorbed through Na -dependent glucose transporter 1 and glucose transporter 5,\nrespectively. Water is absorbed through aquaporin proteins or via paracellular\nprocesses, and amino acids and di -and tripeptides are absorbed through numerous\ntransporter proteins located on the apical and basolateral membranes. The epithelial\nFigure 1. Contributions of biological mechanisms to\nvariation in residual feed intake divergently selected\ncattle(Richardson and Herd, 2004 ).98or intestinal integrity is therefore critical for maintaining a physical barrier between\nthe intestinal lumen and the body. This is dependent lar gely on the junction\ncomplexes connecting enterocytes together and is achieved via a well -organized\nintercellular array of tight junctions, adhesion junctions, and desmosomes\nsurrounding the apical region of epithelial cells.\nChanges in intestinal functi on and integrity can be detrimental to swine and poultry\nhealth and efficiency. An overzealous immune response due to these changes can\nantagonize key production parameters, egg and lean tissue accretion (Escobar et al.,\n2002;Klasing, 2007 ,2009;Mani et a l., 2012).  In poultry and pigs, nutrition is a critical\ncomponent of maintaining and responding to changes in the intestinal epithelium. In\npigs, specific amino acids (arginine, glutamine, glutamate and threonine), long chain\nn-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and glucose have been shown to elicit positive\nbenefits in the growth and repair of the intestinal epithelium in ischemia -reperfusion\ninjury, prenatal stress and rotavirus challenge models (Rhoads et al., 2007 ;Rhoads\nand Wu, 2009 ;Jacobi and Odle, 2012 ). Glutamine is a non -essential amino acid and is\nimportant for rapidly dividing cells, especially immune and epithelial cells of the\nintestine.  In several studies, glutamine has been shown to reduce intestinal injury, as\nwell as stimulate cell turnover via increased cell proliferation and decrea sed\napoptosis (Rhoads and Wu, 2009 ;Swaid et al., 2013 ).  A dipeptide derivative of\nglutamine, alanyl -glutamine has also been shown to increase proliferation and\nmigration while reducing apoptosis (Rodrigues et al., 2013 ).  Other amino acids,\nincluding arginine and le ucine may be beneficial (Rhoads and Wu, 2009 ).  These\namino acids, along with glutamine are prototype amino acid signals.  Glutamine\nactivates the mitogen -activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and increases heat\nshock protein synthesis while arginine and leucine activate the mammalian target of\nrapamycin (mTOR) pathway to promote synthesis of new proteins (Rhoads and Wu,\n2009).Several growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF -\u03b2), and\ninsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF -1) are stimulators of cell proliferation, migration,\nintestinal restitution and decreased paracellular permeability (Blikslager et al., 2007 ).\nProbiotics have also shown promise in the area of intestinal restitution.  Lactob acillus\nand Bifidobacteria species, as well as yeast help preserve intestinal integrity (Rao and\nSamak, 2013 ).  Glucagon like peptide -2 (GLP-2) is also capable of stimulating wound\nrepair/restitution in the intestine (Bulut et al., 2008 ).  In addition to probiotics and\namino acids, medium -chain triglycerides, short chain fatty acids and long -chain\npolyunsaturated fatty acids are also essential components in providing energy a nd\nmaintaining intestinal growth and development. Of particular interest is the n -6\npolyunsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid, and the prostanoid orchestrate recovery\nof paracellular resistance within restituting epithelium (Blikslager et al., 1997 ;\nBlikslager et al., 1999 ;Jacobi et al., 2012 ). Omega-3 fatty acids such as\ndocosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids have also been shown to modulate\nintestinal barrier function and integrity in pigs (Gabler et al., 2007;Gabler et al., 2009 ;\nLiu et al., 2012 ).99Exogenous enzymes (EE)\nVolatility of traditional feed ingredients such as corn, wheat, soybe an meal and canola\nmeal, as forced the swine and poultry industries to seek alternative cost -effective feed\ningredients such as cereal co -products from biofuel and milling industries. However,\nthe ability of mongastric species to fully utilize and capture the nutrients and energy\nout of these cereal co -product feed stuffs is limited by their gastrointestinal tract\nendogenous enzyme production and anatomy. To compensate for this, over the past\ndecade there has been an increase in the use of exogenous enzyme s (EE) in diet\nformulation to facilitate improved energy and nutrient utilization. Most exogenous\nenzymes (EE) additives have been derived from microbial (bacteria or fungal)\nfermentation processes. The classic example for monogastric species has be the\nrampant adoption of phytase, which makes up 60% of the EE world market, with non -\nphytases marking up the rest (carbohydrases ~30% and proteases ~10%) (Adeola\nand Cowieson, 20 11). The proposed mode of action for the use of EE in improving\nproductivity has been classified into four categories (Kiarie et al., 2013 ):\n1.Improved hydrol ysis of feedstuffs that are not sufficiently degraded by the\nanimal\u2019s own enzymes. Thus, increased luminal degradation of anti -nutritional\nfactors that are present in feed ingredients, thus making their constituents\nmore available.\n2.Degradation of cell wal l polysaccharides, thereby preventing the nutrient -\nencapsulating effect these polysaccharides have and thus improving\navailability of starches, fat, amino acids and minerals.\n3.Improving the solubilisation of insoluble compounds such as non -starch\npolysaccha rides for more effective hindgut fermentation and energy utilisation\n4.Complementation of the enzymes (for example, amylase, protease, lipase)\nproduced by young animals where, because of the immaturity of their own\ndigestive system, endogenous enzyme product ion may be inadequate\nAltogether, these EE may not directly confer a health benefit; however, the resulting\noligosaccharides from enzymatic digestion may be beneficial as prebiotics for\ncommensal microflora and high nutrient and energy digestibilty (Kiarie et al., 2013 ).\nFurthermore, Kiarie\u2019s review reported that feed enzymes and their actions might help\nalleviate animals under challenge model conditions while i ncreasing feed intake and\ngain.\nPhytase\nTraditionally, producers have added costly phosphorus rich ingredients to the diet to\nmeet the animal\u2019s requirements for this mineral. As phosphorus is an expensive\nnutrient in diets, and excess phosphorus excretio n has environmental concerns,\nphytases (myo -inositol hexakisphospahte phosphohydrolases) has widely been\nadopted in swine and poultry nutrition. As the majority of phosphorus in plant feed100stuff fed to swine and poultry is bound in mixed salts of phytic ac ids, this EE catalyzes\nthe stepwise hydrolysis of phytic acid (myo -inositol hexahydrogen phosphate;\nphytate). The phytic acid is largely unavailable to swine and poultry without EE\nderived dephosphorylation. Therefore, the addition of phytase to diets has been\nshown to increase the availability of phosphorus, thus reducing the amount of added\nphosphorus needed in diet formulation. Phytases can be characterized as 3 -or 6-\nphytases, depending on where they begin dephosphorylating the inositol ring of\nphytate.Optiphos\u2122 and Natuphos\u2122 are 3 -phytases, while Phyzyme\u2122, Ronozyme\u2122 and\nQuantum\u2122 are 6 -phystases. Advances in phytase technologies are making these EE\nmore thermal stable, resistant to endogenous proteolytic enzymes in the GIT and pH\noptimal. Typically, phy tase can be added to the diet at 500 FTU/kg and this is believed\nto release about 0.10% phosphorus in corn based diets. However, this will vary\ndepending on the phytase source and feed substrate.\nCarbohydrases\nWith the increased inclusion rates of fibe r and the reduction of starch in diets due to\nthe use of co -products, specific carbohydrases that breakdown fiber are being\nadopted.  In particular, xylanase, \u03b2-glucanase, \u03b2-mannanase, \u03b1-galactosidase and\npectinase are of major interest to poultry and swine nutrition. These are all non -\nstarch polysaccharides (NSP) or fiber degrading enzymes that aid in the partial\nhydrolysis of NSP, decrease digesta viscosity, r upturing of NSP -containing cell walls,\nand thus increasing the digestibility and availability of nutrients to monogastric diets.\nEE manufacturers design enzymes and enzyme cocktail blends to work on specific\ndiets and to match the fiber type found in the d iet.  Collectively, these carbohydrases\nare most effective in poultry and young swine diets. Their use in grow -finisher pig\ndiets has had limited success.\nExogenous enzymes and nutrient and energy digestibility\nDigestibility of a feedstuff depends mostly on the general composition (proteins,\nlipids, and carbohydrates) of the feed. However, digestibility can be affected through\nthe action of protease inhibitors within feed, such as glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin in\nsoybeans, or due to the presence of non -starch polysaccharides (NSP) that have\nlimited digestibility in monogastric species due to the lack of endogenous GIT\nenzymes. Non -starch polysaccharides and other fiber components have minimal\ndigestion in the small intestine and are passed on to the large int estine. The cecum\nand proximal colon are the primary sites for fiber fermentation in the large intestine.\nHindgut fermentation produces volatile fatty acids (VFAs), which serve as\nintermediates for gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, or the TCA cycle in intestin al cells and\nthroughout the body. Butyrate has also been shown to positively influence cell\nproliferation and differentiation, and secretion of antimicrobial peptides, e.g.,\ndefensins (Sunkara et al., 2011 ). Additionally, non -starch polysaccharides can also\nserve as prebiotics, i.e., a food source for healthy commensal bacteria in the intestines\n(Liu et al., 2010 ).  Non-starch polysaccharides such as chitin, chitosan, and \u03b2-glucans\nhave been noted for their role in intestinal health. However, they appear to have high\nfunctionality in poultry verses swine nutrition.101Of particular interest to nutritionists is the contribution of nutrient and energy\ndigestibility to changes in FE in poultry and swine. One of the single largest factors\naffecting FE is energy intake. The amount of energy intake and the energy utilization\nthereafter, contributes to changes in metabolizable energy (ME) that could potentially\npoint to differences in digestion, absorption, and utilization of energy for maintenance\nand production. Digestible energy in swine corrects for energy that is not absorbed by\nthe pig and is excreted in feces. While ME in poultry and swine goes even further as it\nadjusts DE fo r the loss of energy from voided urine and gases (Patience, 2012 ). Lastly,\nnet energy (NE) adjusts ME\nfor loss of energy due to\nheat production leaving\nenergy available for\nmaintenance and growth or\nproduction purposes\n(Figure 2). Exogenous\nenzymes supplementation\nin poultry and nursery pig\ndiets has been shown to\nincrease energy and\nnutrient availability. This\nincreased energy\navailability allows for the\nremoval of high cost dietary\nenergy without negative\nconsequences on\nperformance.  Numerous\nstudies have also shown the\nEE supplementation\nimprove energy utilization\nand performance in poultry\n(Fuente et al., 1998 ;Zanella et al., 1999 ;Rutherfurd et al., 2007 ).\nPrebiotics and probiotics\nA comprehensive review by Roberfroid et al. (2010 )reported prebiotics having mixed\neffects, but overall prebiotics do modulate the gut microbiome and promote growth of\nBifidobacteria spp. (lactic acid producing ba cteria), a beneficial species. Probiotics\nhave been the next natural choice as growth promoters as they are micr oorganisms\nthat are commensal to hosts, outcompete pathogenic organisms for nutrients, and/or\nproduce antimicrobials thus suppressing them, stimulate the immune system, and\nhave favorable interaction with the host microflora. However, a disadvantage to\nprobiotic usage is the challenge of an organism colonizing the gut, requiring continual\nsupplementation to maintain the effect. Most probiotic species chosen for\nexperimentation are those belonging to the lactic acid producing bacteria. These\norganisms are re garded for their ability to produce lactic acid from numerous\nsubstrates, which can inhibit pathogenic bacteria. There are numerous studies\nFigure 2. Traditional view of energy systems using a highly\ndigestible diet typical of that used in North American in the\nlate 20thcentury.Adapted from Ewan, (2001); Oresanya,\n(2005).102working to characterize probiotics and their effects on health and growth\nperformance. Wang et al. (2012 )reported higher weight gain and feed efficiency in\npigs fed a Lactobacillus probiotic when compared with control and antibiotic treated\npigs. Many other studies have been summarized already (Cho et al., 2011 )with a\ncommon consensus, that probiotics fed at a concentration of 106CFU/g have been\nable to improve growth rates and feed efficiency in pigs of different ages. Probiotics\nmay also increase digestibility of nutrients due to production of catabolic enzymes.\nWorkbyGiang et al. (2010 )showed an increase in apparent i leal digestibility and\napparent total tract digestibility in weaned pigs 14 days post -weaning using multiple\nprobiotic strains. As the livestock industry will likely have to move away from\nantibiotics in the future, it will be necessary for probiotics to b e developed to help\ncover the gap.\nOrganic acids\nOrganic acids such as formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, citric and lactic acids are being\nused to promote GIT health and integrity in poultry and swine nutrition. Many of\nthese organic acids are also av ailable as sodium, potassium or calcium salts which are\noderless and easier to handle in feed manufacturing. Fed in blends or individually,\nthese acids prevent high moisture feed from molding and have antibacterial\nproperties that may improve animal perfor mance and disease resistance (Ricke,\n2003). Dietary humic acid, a naturally occurring decomposed organic constituent of\nsoil and lignite, has been shown to increase ADG and FE in young pigs (Ji et al., 2006 ;\nWang et al., 2008 ). In broilers, humic acid has been shown to decrease blood\nheterophil counts and the heterophil:lymphocyte ratio (Rath et al., 2006 ). While in\nrats, orally administration of potassium humate has been shown to decrease\ncarrageenan -induced paw edema (Naude et al., 2010 )and leonardite humate\nattenuates the magnitude of the delayed -type hypersensitivity response\n(vanRensburg et al., 2007 ).  Mechanistically, dietary addition of humic acid appears to\ndirectly suppresses the activation of the inflammatory nuclear factor -kappa pathway\nbyE. colilipopolysaccharide (Gau et al., 2000 )and have antimicrobial properties.\nAnother d ietary additive that regulates performance and inflammation is the short\nchain fatty acid, butyric acid. Recently, Lu et al. (2012)reported that butyrate\nsupplemen tation to gestating sows and piglets enhanced post -weaning growth\nperformance, which was suggested to be mediated by increased substrate oxidation.\nAdditionally, dietary butyrate has been shown to reduce liver steatosis and\ninflammation in animals (Mattace Raso et al., 2013 )and suppresses t he inflammatory\nresponse in numerous cell types (Weber and Kerr, 2006 ;Ohira et al., 2013 ).\nBetaine\nBetaine is a small naturally occurring N, N, N-trimethylglycine derivative of the amino\nacid glycine that serves as an osmolyte and methyl donor to protect cells against\nosmotic and temperature stresses (Petronini et al., 1992 ;Petronini et al., 1993 ).  Over\nthe last few decades, betaine has been commonly used in swine and poultry diets to103improve energy utili zation and lean tissue accretion, with modest improvements in\ngrowth performance, feed intake and carcass yields under normal and stress\nconditions (Dunshea and Walton, 1995 ;Odle et al., 2000 ;Partridge and Greimann,\n2002;Zulkifliet al., 2004 ;Dunshea et al., 2013 ;Sakomura et al., 2013 ).  Dietary\nbetaine supplementation may be beneficial to the intestinal epithelium (Kettunen et\nal., 2001 )due to its osmolyte function, maintaining villi integrity and maintaining\nnutrient digestibility and absorption (Eklund et al., 2005 ).\nMycotoxin binders\nMycotoxins are toxic metabolites produced by fungi are natural contaminants of food\nstuffs (Table 1) which can cause harmful effects to both humans as well as animals. It\nis estimated that approximately 25% of world\u2019s agricultural commodities are\ncontaminated with\nmycotoxins. Global losses of foodstuffs due to mycotoxins are in the range of 1000\nmillion tonnes per year. USA and Canada incur approximately $5 billion in losses\nannually because of the impact of mycotoxins on the feed and livestock industries\n(FAO, 2001).  Even though more than four hundred mycotoxins are known, six are\nconsidered important to the feed industry because of the pro pensity of the moulds to\ngrow in the grains used for feed production. These include aflatoxin, deoxynivalenol\n(DON or vomitoxin), ochratoxin, zearalenone (Zen), fumonisin and T -2 toxin. Among\nthe six mycotoxins, aflatoxin is the most toxic and most studied one. Ingestion of the\nmycotoxin affects health and reduces growth and production performance and\nconsumption of the meat and milk contaminated with mycotoxins leads to adverse\nhealth effects on humans.  Overall, mycotoxin contamination leads to severe eco nomic\nlosses to the producers and health risks to the consumers. It is imperative that\ncontamination with mycotoxin needs to be prevented at each step of processing and\nstoring of feed and absorption of mycotoxin from the intestine should be blocked to\nstop the harmful effects to animals and humans.\nMoisture, temperature and availability of oxygen are the major factors which\ninfluence the fungal infestation of foods and gr ains. Fungi themselves may not be toxicTable 1.  Commonly found crop mycotoxins and their cautionary\nlevels\nMycotoxin CropCautionary levels\n(ppm)\nAflatoxin corn, peanuts, cottonseed 0.02\nOchratoxin barley, oilseed crops 0.2\nDeoxynivalenol corn, wheat, barley, rye,\noats1.0\nT-2 wheat, barley 0.5\nZearalenone corn, wheat, barley, rye 0.5\nFumonisin corn 5.0104but the toxins produced by fungi known as mycotoxins are natural contaminants of\nfood stuffs. Even though more than three hundred  mycotoxins are known, six  are\nconsidered important to the swine industry because of the propensity of the moulds\nto grow in the grains used for swine feed production. Fungal infestation of the grains\nand the subsequent toxin contamination could have three significant consequences.\nFirst, the fungal infestation reduces the nutrient content of the feed stuff. Second,\ningestion of the toxins by poultry and pigs can negatively effects health and\nproduction performance.\nAflatoxin which is produced by Aspergillus sps contaminates mainly corn, peanuts\nand cotton seed. There are four types of a flatoxins, B1, B2, G1 and G2. They generally\ncause reduced feed intake and weight gain, liver damage, thymic atrophy and reduced\nimmunity in pigs and poultry. Ochratoxin is produced by Aspergillus and penicillium\nfungal species. Ochratoxin A contaminates c orn, barley, wheat, oats and oilseeds. It is\nnephrotoxic, teratogenic and hepatotoxic (Wood, 1992 )and depresses growth rates\nand egg production in poultry.\nFusarium species produce two different types of toxins. The non -trichothecene toxins\nincluding deoxynivalenol (DON), T -2 toxin and fumonisin, and the mycosestrogens\nlikezearalenone (Zen) and zearalenol toxins. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is formed by\nseveral species of the fungal genus Fusarium. Wheat and maize are the two major feed\nstuffs which get contaminated by DON frequently. The primary effect of the presence\nof DON in th e feed is reduced feed intake which directly correlates with reduced\nweight gain and it inhibits protein synthesis in swine (D\u00e4nicke et al., 2006 ).\nInterestingly, pou ltry are reasonably resistant to DON. Fumonisin is produced by\nFusarium verticillioides and F.proliferatum . Both these fungi mainly contaminate\nmaize. F. verticilloides produces Fumonisin B 1(FB1) which is the most prevalent\nmycotoxin. In general, fumonis ins alter sphingolipid biosynthesis, induce\nhepatotoxicity and elevate serum cholesterol concentration.  Zearalenone is also\nproduced by Fusarium sps. and is commonly found in oats, barley, wheat and\nsorghum. Because of its estrogenic activity, it causes h yper estrogenism and affects\nthe reproductive health leading to infertility in swine (Diekman and Green, 1992 ;\nWood, 1992). However, it poses a relatively low risk to poultry production. Fumonisin\ntoxicity in swine causes injury to pulmonary, hepatic, cardiovascular and immune\nsystems. Further, sphingolipid metabolism is altered and growth rate and carcass\ncomposit ion is affected. High dose exposure to fumonisin toxin particularly to FB1\ncauses a species specific pulmonary edema, abortion and cardiovascular changes. It\nalters intestinal epithelial cell composition and blocks its proliferation (Haschek et al.,\n2001;Bouhet et al., 2004 ).  DON consumption in swine causes growth depression, loss\nof appetite and injury to the g astrointestinal tract (Dillenburger et al., 2001 )and DON\ncauses reduced protein synthesis in kindneys, spleen and intestine of pigs (D\u00e4nicke et\nal., 2006 ). Zearalenone because of i ts estrogenic effects causes tumefaction of the\nvulva, prolapses of the vagina and rectum and enlargement of the mammary glands\nleading to reproductive failure. The prepubertal gilt is most sensitive to Zen toxicity.\nIn the case of cycling animals, zearale none causes conception failure, pseudo\npregnancy and abortion (Rainey et al., 1990 ). Consumption of T -2 toxin leads to105reduction in p erformance in pigs and poultry (Rafai et al., 1995 ;Rafai et al., 2000 ).\nApart from the individual effects w hen two or more mycotoxins are ingested together\nit leads to potentiation of their effect by synergestic action which could severely affect\nthe health and performance of the pigs (Harvey et al., 1991 ).\nAflatoxin (B1, B2, G1 and G2) causes reduced feed intake and weight gain in poultry\nand swine.  Contaminated feed reduces egg production and ducks are relatively more\nsusceptible than broilers. It affects the imm une system rendering the animals more\nsusceptible for other diseases. In swine, it can be transferred to the fetus during\npregnancy or through milk to the suckling pigs (Coffey et al., 1990 ;Silvotti et al.,\n1997). Ochratoxin depresses growth rates and causes and egg production, causes\nabnormal feathering and mouth lesions. Ochratoxin targets the kidney, othe r organs\nlike liver, intestines, spleen, lymphoid tissue and leukocytes at higher doses. At higher\ndoses it causes reduced growth performance.\nThe recommended dietary mycotoxin concentrations for swine and poultry are in the\nppm or ppb\n(Table 2).\nHowever, if a\nproducer is\nfeeding\ncontaminated\ngrains, then the\nabsorption of\nmycotoxins from\nthe GIT can be prevented by the use of dietary binders (Kabak et al., 2006 ;Thieu et al.,\n2008). Mycotoxin binders ar e non-nutritional adsorbents which reduces the bio -\navailability of mycotoxins. Common binders include cationic materials and clays such\nas hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS), zeolites, bentonites, koalinite,\nand diatomaceous earth. Additionall y, activated charcoal, humic acid, yeast cell walls,\npeptidoglycans and polyvinylpyrrolidone compounds can be utilized to attrach and\nbind luminal mycotoxins. HSCAS appear to be very effective adsorbent of aflatoxin.\nHowever, bentonites are commonly used f or binding most mycotoxins.\nConclusions\nImproving feed efficiency and growth rates in poultry and swine production is a major\ngaol for competitive and sustainable production. However, as producers move\ntowards more alternative cost -effective feed ingred ients such as cereal co -products\nfrom biofuel and milling industries, monogastric digestive efficiencies may decline as\nthe complex carbohydrate and anti -nutritional components of the diet increases.  As\nsuch, improving nutrient and energy digestibility th rough the use of EE and other\ndietary additives is a way producers can overcome this dilemma.  Reductions in\nintestinal health and integrity also reduce production efficiencies. Therefore the use of\npre-and probiotics, mycotoxin binders and organic acids provide exogenous dietary\nstrategies to maximize health and productivity. However, the collective efficacy ofTable 2.

As dietary\nprotein is reduced ,a deficiency of some amino acids (AAs) occurs, and therefore,\nsupplementation with industrial amino acids becomes necessary to achieve the\nrequirement sfor optimal broiler growth performance. Here, we hi ghlight the\nimportance of industrial amino acid supplementation in broiler diets, and their effect\non production parameters. It is concluded that updating the ideal protein is necessary\nto keep up with changes in performance, as well as with common health challenge s.\nThe order of limiting AAs in broiler diets changes with age and type of diet. The\nrecommended essential N to total N ratio ( Ne:Nt)is 50% or less. More research should\nbe developed to better understand the relationship between essential and\nnonessential AAs in broiler diets with reduced protein levels. The addition of\nindustrial AAs to broiler diets can be increased significantly, depending on economic\nviability.\nResumen\nLa formulaci\u00f3n de raciones con base en el concepto de prote\u00edna ideal optim iza la\neficiencia de la utilizaci\u00f3n de los amino\u00e1cidos (prote\u00edna) e disminuye la excreci\u00f3n de\nnitr\u00f3geno (N). Conforme es reducida la prote\u00edna diet\u00e9tica, algunos amino\u00e1cidos (AAs)\nesenciales pasan a ser deficientes, siendo necesaria la suplementaci\u00f3n de ami no\u00e1cidos\nindustriales hasta alcanzar el requerimiento para \u00f3ptimo desempe\u00f1o de las aves. En\neste trabajo es resaltada la importancia de la suplementaci\u00f3n de amino\u00e1cidos\nindustriales en las raciones y su influencia sobre los par\u00e1metros productivos en pollos\nde engorde. As\u00ed, podemos concluir que la actualizaci\u00f3n y la utilizaci\u00f3n de la prote\u00edna\nideal es necesaria para acompa\u00f1ar los cambios del mercado consumidos y el desaf\u00edo\nsanitario de las aves. El orden de los amino\u00e1cidos limitantes en las dietas para pollo s\nde engorde var\u00eda con la edad y el tipo de dieta. La relaci\u00f3n de N esencial : N total\nrecomendada es 50% o menor. Nuevas investigaciones deben ser realizadas con\npollos de engorde para mejorar el conocimiento de la relaci\u00f3n entre AAs esenciales y\nno esenc iales en dietas con reducci\u00f3n proteica. El nivel de AAs industriales en las\ndietas de pollos de engorde puede ser aumentado significativamente dependiendo de\nla viabilidad econ\u00f3mica.114Introducci\u00f3n\nLa avicultura es una actividad que se ha desarrollado espe cialmente en las \u00faltimas\nd\u00e9cadas debido principalmente a la acci\u00f3n conjunta entre la gen\u00e9tica, nutrici\u00f3n,\nsanidad y manejo. El avance de la nutrici\u00f3n est\u00e1 asociado al conocimiento del valor\nnutricional de los ingredientes y los requerimientos nutricionales de los animales en\nlas diferentes fases productivas. La alimentaci\u00f3n de las aves representa\naproximadamente 70% del costo total de producci\u00f3n, siendo necesario el continuo\ndesarrollo de investigaciones relacionadas al establecimiento de niveles nutriciona les\n\u00f3ptimos que promuevan el m\u00e1ximo desempe\u00f1o productivo del animal a un menor\ncosto.\nEn la actualidad, aparte de los amino\u00e1cidos normalmente adicionados en las raciones\n(Met, Lis y Thr), existen otros amino\u00e1cidos industriales que de acuerdo al precio de\nlos ingredientes pueden ser utilizados en las raciones av\u00edcolas, como Val, Arg, Trp, Gli,\nGln y Glu; que han estimulado la realizaci\u00f3n de investigaciones para actualizar los\nniveles nutricionales recomendados para optimo desempe\u00f1o y mejor rendimiento de\ncortes nobles.\nEn los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, la formulaci\u00f3n de dietas, con base en el concepto de prote\u00edna\nideal, ha adquirido mayor importancia, pues determina el balance exacto de los\namino\u00e1cidos sin deficiencias o excesos, reduciendo as\u00ed el nivel de prote\u00edna cruda en la\ndieta. Conforme es reducida la prote\u00edna diet\u00e9tica, algunos amino\u00e1cidos pasan a ser\ndeficientes siendo necesaria la suplementaci\u00f3n de amino\u00e1cidos industriales hasta\nalcanzar el requerimiento para optimo desempe\u00f1o de las aves (Wu, 2013).\nEl objetivo de este trabajo es resaltar la importancia de la utilizaci\u00f3n de amino\u00e1cidos\nindustriales en las raciones para pollos de engorde, los factores que pueden\ninfluenciar el nivel recomendado de los amino\u00e1cidos y el efecto de la relaci\u00f3n N\nesencial : N total (Ne:N t) sobre el desempe\u00f1o de las aves.\nAmino\u00e1cidos\nLos amino\u00e1cidos (AAs) son las unidades estructurales de las prote\u00ednas. En el\norganismo existen m\u00e1s de 100.000 tipos de prote\u00ednas que son constituidas por la\ncombinaci\u00f3n de apenas 20 AAs los cuales son llamad os proteicos (Ala, Arg, Asp, Asn,\nCis, Phe, Gli, Glu, Gln, His, Ile, Leu, Lis, Met, Pro, Ser, Tir, Thr, Trp y Val) (Wu, 2013).\nAlgunos amino\u00e1cidos proteicos no son sintetizados por el animal para mantener\nadecuado balance de N, y deben ser proporcionados e n la dieta, estos son llamados\nAAs esenciales. Los AAs que pueden ser sintetizados por el animal para mantener el\nbalance de N son llamados no esenciales. Sin embargo, en ciertas condiciones de\ndesaf\u00edo sanitario o estr\u00e9s algunos AAs no esenciales se vuelve n esenciales para\nmantener el equilibrio metab\u00f3lico del animal, estos son llamados AAs\ncondicionalmente esenciales o funcionales (Blachier et al., 2013).115Prote\u00edna Ideal\nEn la actualidad es posible formular dietas para pollos de engorde con bajo nivel\nproteico y con la suplementaci\u00f3n de varios amino\u00e1cidos industriales. Para usar este\nprocedimiento, es necesario utilizar el concepto de prote\u00edna ideal para atender con\nprecisi\u00f3n los requerimientos nutricionales de los amino\u00e1cidos y obtener \u00f3ptimo\ndesempe\u00f1o z oot\u00e9cnico y econ\u00f3mico.\nExisten varios trabajos en la literatura mostrando valores de prote\u00edna ideal para aves\nutilizando experimentos dosis respuesta. Las recomendaciones de Rostagno et al\n(2011), publicadas en las Tablas Brasile\u00f1as de 2011, sobre prote\u00edn a ideal fueran\ndeterminadas utilizando resultados de experimentos de dosis respuesta los cuales\ndeterminan la relaci\u00f3n ideal con base en la respuesta en el desempe\u00f1o de los animales\nalimentados con dietas conteniendo niveles crecientes del AA en estudio.\nSin embargo en pesquisas con cerdos determinaron la mejor relaci\u00f3n entre los AAs\nesenciales partiendo del principio de que los cambios en la retenci\u00f3n de N por la\nremoci\u00f3n de un AA esencial puede ser usado para formular una raci\u00f3n testigo con AAs\ndiet\u00e9ticos donde todos sean igualmente limitantes.\nOtra metodolog\u00eda usada para determinar la mejor relaci\u00f3n entre los AAs esenciales es\nla retenci\u00f3n de N utilizada con cerdos por Wang e Fuller (1989). Recientemente\nfueron publicados dos trabajos, con pollos de engo rde, donde fue aplicado el m\u00e9todo\nde balance de N tambi\u00e9n llamado de m\u00e9todo Gottingen (Dorigan et al, 2013 y Wecke y\nLiebert, 2013). En la Tabla 1 son mostradas las relaciones AA digestible:Lis digestible\n(dig) recomendadas por estos autores y por Rostagno et al 2011). Es posible concluir\nque salvo peque\u00f1as discrepancias los niveles recomendados en las tres publicaciones\nson similares, especialmente cuando son considerados los principales AAs: Met+Cis,\nThr, Trp, Arg y Val.\nTabla 1.

(2010) y utilizando los resultados de 21\npublicaciones que evaluaron las relaciones Val:Lis dig (14 referencias) y Ile:Lis\ndigestible (7 referencias), permitieron concluir que la mejor relaci\u00f3n Val:Lis dig para116ganancia de peso y eficiencia alimentar en pollos de engorde fue de 80% y para Ile:Lis\ndig fue de 67%.\nFactores que pueden Alterar la Relaci\u00f3n AA:Lis Dig\n\uf0b7Modelo Usado para Estimar la Relaci\u00f3n y el Par\u00e1metro Evaluado\nExisten vari os factores que pueden influenciar la respuesta de los animales al nivel del\nAA en la dieta y alterar la relaci\u00f3n AA:Lis dig, entre ellos se puede destacar el\nambiente, clima y gen\u00e9tica. Otro factor que puede influenciar la relaci\u00f3n recomendada\nes el model o estad\u00edstico utilizado para procesar los datos experimentales. El\ninvestigador tiene que conocer los diferentes modelos, saber acerca de sus ventajas y\nlas limitaciones optando por el (los) que mejor se ajuste a los datos obtenidos\n(Sakomura e Rostagno, 2 007).\nEuclydes e Rostagno (2001) compararon diferentes metodolog\u00edas Cuadr\u00e1tica, 95%\nCuadr\u00e1tica, Linear Response Plateau (LRP o Broken Line), Cuadr\u00e1tica con Plateau y\nExponencial utilizando los datos medios de 5 experimentos realizados en la\nUniversidad Fed eral de Vi\u00e7osa, en que se estimaron los requerimientos de Lis dig para\npollos de engorde. Para conversi\u00f3n alimenticia, los autores observaron una diferencia\nde 8,7% entre la menor (LRP) y la mayor (Cuadr\u00e1tica) estimativa.\nSeg\u00fan Leclerq (1998) algunas respu estas biol\u00f3gicas son pr\u00f3ximas al modelo LRP, pero\notras son claramente curvil\u00edneas, por tanto, para muchos AAs el modelo LRP (Broken\nLine) subestima el requerimiento cuando es comparado a otros modelos curvil\u00edneos y\necon\u00f3micos.\nUn procedimiento similar fue realizado por Rostagno et al. (2014) con el objetivo de\ndeterminar la mejor relaci\u00f3n Val:Lis dig para pollos de engorde de 22 a 42 d\u00edas,\nusando los resultados medios de 11 experimentos, publicados entre 2004 y 2013. Los\nautores utilizaron diferentes model os matem\u00e1ticos y concluyeron que, con base en los\ndatos de ganancia de peso y eficiencia alimenticia, el valor promedio para Val:Lis dig\nfue 79,7%. Sin embargo, para eficiencia alimenticia la estimativa vari\u00f3 entre 83,5 y\n88,4% para el modelo LRP y Cuadr\u00e1t ica respectivamente. Para ganancia de peso la\ndiferencia entre el modelo LRP y el Cuadr\u00e1tico fue 11,4% (Tabla 2, Figura 1 y 2). Otro\nfactor a llevar en consideraci\u00f3n en el momento de interpretar los datos es el\npar\u00e1metro evaluado, que puede ser de desempe \u00f1o o rendimiento de pechuga.\nTabla 2.

La literatura muestra resultados contradictorios cuando son\ncomparadas las recomendaciones de AAs para optima conversi\u00f3n alimenticia versus\nrendimiento de pechuga en pollos de engorde, sin embargo existe consenso de que el\nnivel del AA para una mejor conversi\u00f3n y rendimiento de pechuga es mayor que para\nganancia de peso (Rostagno et al, 2007).\nLa Met es el primer AA limitante para pollos de engorde alimentados con raciones a\nbase de ma\u00edz y harina de soja, siendo destacada su participaci\u00f3n en la s\u00edntesis de\nprote\u00edna y precursora de Cis, as\u00ed como donadora de grup os metil (Wu, 2013).\nEn este contexto Pessoa (2013) determino la mejor respuesta de las aves al\nsuministro de diferentes relaciones Met+Cis/Lis dig en pollos de engorde. El autor\nobservo que el aumento en la relaci\u00f3n Met+Cis/Lis dig. en las fases de 1 -10;10-21 y\n21-42 d\u00edas, 77 -78-73 y 77-78-78 en pollos de engorde de 1 a 42 d\u00edas mejoro el peso\ndel file de la pechuga en +2,8 e +4,5%, respectivamente.\nNo fue observada diferencia estad\u00edstica (P<0,999) en los par\u00e1metros de\ndesempe\u00f1o de las aves, lo que sugiere que el requerimiento para optimo desempe\u00f1o\n(ganancia y conversi\u00f3n) es menor que para rendimiento de pechuga (tabla 3).118Tabla 3.

El exceso de Leu en las dietas de pollos\nes catabolizado aumentando la activ idad de la aminotransferasa y la desidrogenasa,\nque tambi\u00e9n aumentan el catabolismo de la Val e Ile, lo que puede causar deficiencia y\nreducci\u00f3n en el desempe\u00f1o.  Por tanto, el exceso de Leu en las dietas puede resultar en\ndeficiencia de AAs (Ile y Val), p rincipalmente cuando son utilizados niveles diet\u00e9ticos\nen el requerimiento (sin exceso). Se puede concluir que niveles altos de Leu,\ncontribuyen significativamente para el aumento del catabolismo de los dem\u00e1s AACR\npor la activaci\u00f3n del sistema de catabolis mo (figura 3).\nFigura 3. Metabolismo de los AAs de cadena ramificada (Adaptado de Brosnan et al.,\n2006)\nEs posible que el aumento (mayor que el requerimiento) en los niveles de Val o de Ile\nen dietas con niveles excesivos de Leu resulten en mejor\u00edas en los \u00edndices de\ndesempe\u00f1o. En este contexto, Maia (2013) evalu\u00f3 el efecto de la utilizaci\u00f3n de\ndiferentes relaciones dieteticas de Ile:Lis, Val:Lis y Leu:Lis sobre el desempe\u00f1o en\npollos de engorde en el periodo de 14 a 23 d\u00edas (Tabla 4).\nEl aumento de la relaci\u00f3n Leu:Lis dig de 107 (requerimiento) para 150 perjudic\u00f3 la\nganancia de peso (628,7 vs 612,9 g) y la conversi\u00f3n alimenticia (1,436 vs 1,467) de los\npollos de engorde.\nDebe resaltarse que el nivel 150 de Leu:Lis dig es f\u00e1cilmente alcanzado en dietas a\nbase de ma\u00edz y harina de soja. El aumento en las relaciones Val:Lis y Ile:Lis no afecto el119desempe\u00f1o de las aves. A pesar de no presentar efecto significativo (P>0,05) para\nganancia de peso y conversi\u00f3n, fue verificada que la relaci\u00f3n Val:Lis dig de 90% e n\ndietas con exceso de Leu aument\u00f3 la ganancia de peso en 3% (608,9 vs 626.5 g). Se\npuede concluir que una mayor relaci\u00f3n Val:Lis en dietas con exceso de Leu mantiene\ndesempe\u00f1o adecuado en pollos de engorde (Tabla 4).\nTabla 4.

El amino\u00e1cido\nlimitante es normalmente un AA esencial que est\u00e1 presente en la dieta en poca\ncantidad en comparaci\u00f3n al requerimiento diario del animal (Wu, 2013).\nVarios experimentos fueron realizados por Waguespack et al. (2009) con el objetivo\nde determinar que AAs eran lim itantes en dietas a base de ma\u00edz y harina de soja. Los\nautores concluir\u00e1n que para pollitos de 1 a 18 d\u00edas de edad el orden fue: 1. Met, 2. Lis,\n3. Thr, 4. Gli, 5. Val y/o Arg. Utilizando los datos de composici\u00f3n y requerimientos\nnutricionales para pollos de engorde (7 a 21 d\u00edas) de las Tablas Brasile\u00f1as (Rostagno\net al, 2011) fueron realizadas simulaciones y estimados los AAs limitantes de una\ndieta a base de ma\u00edz y harina de soja: 1. Met, 2. Lis, 3. Thr, 4. Val, 5. Gli +Ser, 6. Arg y/o\nIle. Aplicando el m ismo procedimiento para las fases de 21 a 33 y de 33 a 42 d\u00edas de\nedad para pollos de engorde el orden de los AAs limitantes fue: 1, Met, 2. Lis, 3. Thr, 4.\nVal, 5. Ile y/o Arg.\nSeg\u00fanWu (2013) en las dietas a base de maiz y harina de soja para pollos de engorde\nen la fase de crecimiento, la Arg puede ser el quinto AA limitante, despues de la\nMet+Cis, Lis, Thr y Val.\nCuando son formuladas dietas a base de maiz, harina de soja, harina de carne y huesos\n44% PC (cantidad fija 4%) y harina de plumas 75% PC (c antidad fija de 2%) el orden\nde los aminoacidos limitantes para pollos en el periodo de 21 a 33 d\u00edas de edad es: 1.\nMet, 2. Lis, 3. Thr, 4. Trp y/o Ile, 5. Val.\nEn una revisi\u00f3n hecha por Prymot et al. (2010) con el objetivo de dilucidar cual AA es\nlimitante despu\u00e9s de Met, Lis y Thr en dietas para pollos de engorde, los autores\nconcluyeran que la Val era el cuarto AA limitante, en dietas formuladas con120ingredientes de origen vegetal, sin embargo cuando son utilizados alimentos de origen\nanimal la Ile pasa a ser el cuarto AA limitante.\nRelaci\u00f3n Nitr\u00f3geno Esencial: Nitr\u00f3geno Total\nLa prote\u00edna cruda fue utilizada por muchos a\u00f1os en la formulaci\u00f3n de dietas para\npollos de engorde. Su aplicaci\u00f3n promueve el exceso de AAs diet\u00e9ticos que deber\u00e1n\nser catalizados y excretados al ambiente resultando en grandes p\u00e9rdidas, tanto\nenerg\u00e9ticas como econ\u00f3micas, principalmente cuando hay desequilibrio de AAs.\nActualmente es recomendado formular dietas con la proporci\u00f3n ideal de AAs a modo\nde que no existan ni exceso ni defi ciencia de AAs.\nLas aves no tienen requerimiento nutricional de prote\u00edna cruda, m\u00e1s si de cada uno de\nlos AAs esenciales (AAe) que componen la prote\u00edna y una cantidad suficiente de N\npara bios\u00edntesis de AA no esencial (AAne) (Costa e Goulart, 2010).\nDiferentes trabajos apuntan a la reducci\u00f3n proteica con suplementaci\u00f3n de AAs\nindustriales en la dieta, como herramienta para mantener el \u00f3ptimo desempe\u00f1o y\nreducir la excreci\u00f3n de N al ambiente.  La reducci\u00f3n proteica tambi\u00e9n se muestra\nventajosa porque disminu ye el incremento cal\u00f3rico de la dieta, lo que es recomendado\nen condiciones de estr\u00e9s t\u00e9rmico.\nLa gran disparidad para obtener una estimativa de la \u00f3ptima relaci\u00f3n AAe:AAne es\natribuida a las diferentes formas de expresar esas relaciones entre los dos gru pos de\nAAs y la clasificaci\u00f3n diferente entre la esencialidad o no de algunos AAs (Heger,\n2003). Existen varias formas de expresar la relaci\u00f3n entre AAe:AAne, pudiendo el AAe\nser relacionado con la cantidad total de AAs (AAt), AA no esencial (AAne), N tota l (Nt)\no prote\u00edna total.\nLa principal funci\u00f3n del AAne es proporcionar N no especifico, la proporci\u00f3n de los\ngrupos de los AAs debe ser expresada con base en el N, de la misma forma como\nNe:Nne y Ne:Nt. Esta \u00faltima relaci\u00f3n parece ser la m\u00e1s aceptable una vez que la\nrelaci\u00f3n Ne:Nne tiende al infinito cuando la concentraci\u00f3n de AAne es pr\u00f3xima a cero.\nEl N total presente en una dieta es dada como la suma entre Ne + Nne.\nLa optima relaci\u00f3n Ne:Nt para crecimiento o deposici\u00f3n de prote\u00edna estimada para un\nnivel constante de Nt, usando la misma clasificaci\u00f3n de los AAs, no difiere\nsubstancialmente entre especies y var\u00eda entre 43 y 55% (Heger, 2003).\nEstudios han demostrado que la suplementaci\u00f3n de AAne en las dietas tambi\u00e9n es\nusada como una manera de mejorar el desempe\u00f1o, y prevenir el uso de AA esencial\npara la s\u00edntesis de AAne (Costa e Goulart, 2010).\nExisten investigaciones mostrando la reducci\u00f3n en el desempe\u00f1o de las aves\nalimentadas con dietas de bajo nivel de prote\u00edna lo que seg\u00fan Afta et al. (2006) puede\nestar asociado a varios factores, entre ellos: a) Variaciones diet\u00e9ticas en los niveles de\npotasio y el balance electrol\u00edtico, b) Insuficiente N para s\u00edntesis de AAne, c) Reducci\u00f3n\nen el consumo de raci\u00f3n de las aves, d) Alteraci\u00f3n de la relaci\u00f3n AAe:AAne , e)\nDeficiencia de algunos AAs esenciales, f) Diferencias en la eficiencia de utilizaci\u00f3n de\nlos AAs de la prote\u00edna intacta vs AAs cristalinos, g) Aumento en la relaci\u00f3n Energ\u00eda\nNeta: Energ\u00eda Metabolizable.\nEn dietas con niveles altos o adecuados de prote \u00edna, los AAne pueden ser sintetizados\na partir de los AAs en exceso presentes en la dieta.  Sin embargo con la reducci\u00f3n de121tres o cuatro puntos porcentuales del nivel proteico, la s\u00edntesis y disponibilidad de\nAAne y N pasa a ser limitante lo que puede res ultar en bajo desempe\u00f1o (Dean et\nal.,2006; Payne, 2007). Por tanto, el uso de niveles adecuados de AAne con el\nprop\u00f3sito de encontrar el equilibrio correcto entre Ne:Nt en las dietas de pollos de\nengorde resulta en una mejora en la eficiencia de utilizaci\u00f3 n de la prote\u00edna diet\u00e9tica.\nHeger et al (1998), realizaron un ensayo con objetivo de evaluar el efecto de la\nrelaci\u00f3n Ne:Nt (25 a 86%) sobre la retenci\u00f3n de N con cerdos en la fase de\ncrecimiento. Los autores verificaron que la retenci\u00f3n de N s e mantuvo constante hasta\nalcanzar la relaci\u00f3n de 48% disminuyendo linealmente con valores superiores. Estos\nresultados sugieren que con valores de Ne:Nt arriba de 50 los AAes son parcialmente\ndegradados y usados para la s\u00edntesis de AAnes.\nUso de Amino\u00e1c idos Industriales en las Dietas para Pollos de Engorde\nEn los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os niveles reducidos de prote\u00edna cruda han sido investigadas en\npollos de engorde, sin embargo los resultados obtenidos son controversiales. En una\nrevisi\u00f3n hecha por Aftab et al. (20 06) fue concluido que es posible reducir la prote\u00edna\nde una dieta para aves en 10% sin afectar estad\u00edsticamente el desempe\u00f1o. Los autores\nrecopilaron datos de 16 experimentos con pollos de engorde de diferentes edades,\npublicados entre los a\u00f1os 1991 y 2006 , donde la prote\u00edna cruda media de la dieta\ntestigo fue de 21,4% versus 18,8% de la dieta con prote\u00edna reducida + AAs, la ganancia\nde peso y la eficiencia alimenticia relativa de las aves (Control = 1) fue de 0,99 y 0,98,\nrespectivamente.\nEl uso de AAs in dustriales, aplicando el concepto de prote\u00edna ideal, permiti\u00f3 la\nutilizaci\u00f3n de un perfil adecuado de AAs en dietas para pollos de engorde (Baker et al.\n2002). Diversos ensayos fueran realizados por Baker (2003) para determinar las\nrelaciones AAs:Lis. Para esto, los autores utilizaron una dieta testigo a base de ma\u00edz y\nharina de soja y una dieta semi -purificada con 14,6% de AAs cristalinos y 18,34% de\nharina de gluten de ma\u00edz, como \u00fanica fuente de prote\u00edna intacta. El desempe\u00f1o de\npollos de engorde alimenta dos con la dieta semi -purificada en la fase de 8 a 20 d\u00edas\nfue estad\u00edsticamente similar a las aves que recibieran la dieta testigo.\nWaguespack et al. (2009) estudiaran el efecto de dietas con reducci\u00f3n proteica y\nsuplementaci\u00f3n con AAs cristalinos sobre el desempe\u00f1o de pollos de engorde de 0 a\n18 d\u00edas. Los autores verificaron que aves alimentadas con dietas a base de ma\u00edz y\nharina de soja conteniendo 19% de PC y suplementadas con Met, Lis, Thr, Gli, Ile, Arg y\nVal (total de 25,84 kg/ton.) presentaron una ganancia de peso y eficiencia alimenticia\nsemejante a las aves alimentadas con dietas conteniendo 22% de prote\u00edna (tabla 5).\nEstos resultados sugieren que la suplementaci\u00f3n de varios AAs en dietas con\nreducci\u00f3n proteica es una pr\u00e1ctica indicada en la form ulaci\u00f3n de raciones.\nEl orden de limitaci\u00f3n de AAs en dietas para pollos de engorde de 8 a 22 d\u00edas de edad\nfue tambi\u00e9n estudiada por Han et al. (1992), donde fue verificado que aparte de la\nsuplementaci\u00f3n con AAes en dietas con 19% PC, existe la necesidad de suplementar\ncon una fuente de Nne a trav\u00e9s de la utilizaci\u00f3n de Glu. La suplementaci\u00f3n con Glu\naumento la eficiencia alimenticia y redujo la grasa corporal (tabla 6). Se debe resaltar\nque el aumento en la relaci\u00f3n carne:grasa fue mayor para las aves qu e recibieran la\nsuplementaci\u00f3n con Glu.122Tabla 5.

Similarmente, Berres et al,\n(2010) observaron un adecuado desempe\u00f1o y rendim iento de pechuga en pollos de\nengorde alimentados con dietas bajas en prote\u00edna y suplementadas con Met, Lis, Thr,\nVal, Ile, Gli y Glu. Los autores sugieren que en este tipo de dieta, la suplementaci\u00f3n de\nN, principalmente de Glu, es necesaria para sintetiz ar AAne.\nTabla 6.

(2010 a,b), realizaron 4 experimentos por con el objetivo\nde evaluar diferentes niveles de prote\u00edna y relaciones de Ne:Nt para pollos de engorde\nde 8 a 21 y de 22 a 40 d\u00edas. Las dietas experimentales, a base de ma\u00edz y harina de soja,\nfueron formuladas isolisina siendo solamente adicionados AAs cristalinos esenciales\npara atender los requerimientos (prote\u00edna ideal) recomendadas por Rostagno et al\n(2011). Los resultados de desempe\u00f1o son presentados en la Tabla 7, y permiten\nconcluir que: para pollos de engorde en las fases inicial y crecimiento la prote\u00edna\npuede ser reducida para 21% y 18% respectivamente. Cuando es llevada en\nconsideraci\u00f3n la relaci\u00f3n Ne:Nt, los mejores resultados de desempe\u00f1o en las dos fases\nevaluadas fueron obtenidas con valores entre 45 y 50%  de Ne:Nt. Se debe resaltar,\nque en los cuatro experimentos realizados por los autores, no fueron encontradas123diferencias significativas en el peso y el rendimiento de la pechuga de las aves que\nrecibieron las dietas con los diferentes niveles proteicos.\nDe la misma form a, Maia (2014) evalu\u00f3 usando pollos de engorde de 8 a 21 d\u00edas dos\nrelaciones de Ne:Nt (47,66 vs 51,48%). Las dietas fueron formuladas a base de ma\u00edz,\nharina de soja y gluten de ma\u00edz + AAs, utilizando el Glu como fuente de Nne para\nalcanzar la relaci\u00f3n de 4 7,66% de Ne:Nt. El desempe\u00f1o de las aves alimentadas con la\ndieta de 20,5% de prote\u00edna (51,48% Ne:Nt) fue inferior a los de las aves que\nrecibieron la dieta control con 22% de prote\u00edna (47,66% Ne:Nt), sin embargo, la\nganancia de peso y la conversi\u00f3n alimen ticia del tratamiento con 20,5% de prote\u00edna +\nGlu y con una relaci\u00f3n Ne:Nt de 47,66% fue similar al tratamiento testigo y superior al\ntratamiento con una relaci\u00f3n de 51,48% sin la adici\u00f3n de Glu (tabla 7).\nTabla 7.

Keating, Lance H. Baumgard and Jason W. Ross\nDepartment of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011\nSummary\nInfertility and subfertility in production animals represent important economic,\nhealth and welfare issues.  Non -successful breedin g and embryonic mortality are\nmajor limitations to reproductive efficiency.  Additionally, with increased\nrequirements for efficient production of animal protein to feed a growing world\neconomy, compromised fertility represents a global food security conce rn.  This\nreview will focus chiefly on swine and ruminant reproduction for which the majority\nof knowledge has been acquired.  The primary objective of this paper is to review an\nenvironmental stress (hyperthermia) and a physiological condition (bacterial\ninfection) that both impair fecundity and fertility in domestic animal species.  The\nsecondary objective is to provide a brief summary of potential mitigation strategies to\nimprove animal reproductive efficiency in the face of such stressors.\nResumen\nInfertilidad en animales: Causas y potenciales estrategias de\nmitigaci\u00f3n\nLa infertilidad y subfertilidad en los animales de producci\u00f3n representan problemas\nimportantes en la econom\u00eda y la salud y bienestar de los animales.

At birth, the ovary is endowed with a finite number of oocytes\nhoused in follicular structure.  The pre -antral follicle is comprised of the oocyte and\ngranulosa cells.  Following antrum formation, another layer of cells, theca, are\nrecruited to surrou nd the granulosa cells.  Within the antrum, follicular fluid provides\nnourishment to the developing oocyte (Hirshfield, 1991) .  The oocyte is arrested in\nthe prophase I stage of meiosis, and will not resume and complete meiosis I and II\nuntil ovulation and fertilization, respectively.  The vast majority of oocytes are lost to a\nprocess known as atresia, and only approximately 1% of oocytes which initially\nendow the ovary will ovulate.  The female sex steroid hormones, 17 \u03b2-estradiol (E 2)\nand progesterone (P 4) are produced by pre -ovulatory, dominant follicles and the\ncorpus luteum (CL), respectively.  Briefly, an upper E 2threshold is required to induce\na surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary in order to induce\novulation.  In addition, LH regulates ovarian steroidogenesis and the process of\nluteinization by which CL formation occurs.  The CL produces P 4, a hormone needed\nfor implantation and pregnancy maintenance.  In addition to inducing the LH surge, E 2\nis required for appropriate disp lay of secondary female sex characteristics and is the\ndominant hormone involved in the demonstration of behavioral estrus.  Should\npregnancy occur, E 2synthesis and release from the developing porcine conceptus\nprevents the luteolytic (CL degradation) act ion of PGF2 \u03b1, and the CL\u2019s, and thus the\npregnancy, are maintained.  Both E 2and P 4have specific ovarian receptors \u2013the\nestrogen receptors \u03b1(ER\u03b1) and\u03b2(ER\u03b2) and the progesterone receptor isoforms A\nand B (PRA and PRB).  The process of folliculogenesis which comp rises oocyte\ndevelopment and maturation within the follicular structure, and steroidogenesis for\nhormone production are essential for efficient reproduction.  Any stressor that\nnegatively affects either process will compromise fertility and fecundity.\nReproductive Impacts of Heat Stress\nHyperthermia in swine :\nThe swine industry suffers considerably due to impaired reproductive performance\nduring periods of seasonal infertility, particularly during late summer and early\nautumn months (Pollmann, 201 0).  The impact is particularly visible in the U.S. with\nday 28 pregnancy rates reaching a nadir in August into October and subsequently\nreduced farrowing in November and December.  This phenomenon is not limited to\nspecific regions and occurs internationa lly(Auvigne et al., 2010; Pollmann, 2010) .\nSeveral components can contribute to seasonal infertility, such as photoperiod and\nenvironmental conditions (i.e. temperature) and deciphering the precise contribution129of each on swine reproductive performance i s difficult.  Despite that, heat stress has\nbeen repeatedly demonstrated to negatively impact reproductive efficiency in pigs by\naffecting gamete development, pregnancy establishment, maintenance of gestation,\nand lactation performance.\nFolliculogenesis:\nThe impact of heat stress during oocyte maturation and early embryonic development\nis evidenced in that sows exposed to hyperthermia for 5 days following breeding have\nsignificantly reduced number of viable embryos after day 27 of gestation, with control\npigs possessing an average of 11.0 (68.8% survival) viable embryos and heat stressed\nsows containing only 6.8 (39.1% survival) viable embryos (Tompkins et al., 1967).  In\nthis study, heat stress was administered following breeding, which generally occurs\nprior to ovulation and complete oocyte maturation, as pigs typically ovulate in the mid\nto latter half of estrus (Soedeet al., 1992).\nDue to the difficulty for such studies in vivo, characterization of heat stress effects\nduring oocyte growth and maturati on and early embryonic development in pigs has\nbeen demonstrated using in vitrooocyte maturation and embryo culture systems.\nSome evidence of in vitroheat stress models during the transition between germinal\nvesicle breakdown and the 4 -cell stage of dev elopment demonstrates the\nsusceptibility of this stage to heat stress.  A nine hour culture of pig embryos at 42oC\nfollowing porcine in vitrofertilization reduced blastocyst formation rate from 20.6%\nto 8.8% (Isomet al., 2007)and heat shock of 41.5oC for 4 hours following in vitro\nmaturation also reduced oocyte development (Tsenget al., 2006).\nWe have also demonstrated the impact of in vitro heat stress during oocyte\nmaturation and its impact on subsequent developmental competency.  Oocytes\nexposed to heat stress (41oC) for the first half (21h) or the duration of (42 -44 h) ofin\nvitromaturation demonstrated impaired ability to reach metaphase II arrest while\nheat stress during only the second half (21h) of in vitromaturation did not impact\nmaturation rate (Wright and Ross, unpublished data).  Metaphase II arrested oocytes\nfollowing heat stress during in vitro maturation demonstrated impaired\ndevelopmental competency compared to oocytes matured at 39oC, as measured by\ntheir ability to develop to the bl astocyst stage following in vitrofertilization and\nculture in thermal neutral conditions.  We have subsequently used this model to\ndemonstrate differences in gene expression in developing 4 -to 8-cell embryos as a\nresult of heat stress conditions during in vitro maturation (Wright and Ross,\nunpublished data).\nGestational impacts:\nThe effect of heat stress during pregnancy in pigs is variable as different stages of\ngestation can be variably affected.  This is demonstrated by a study conducted by130Omtvedt etal. (1971) in which exposed pregnant gilts to heat stress for 8 days during\ndifferent stages of gestation.  Heat stress (37.8oC for 17 hours and 32.2oC for 7 hours)\nbeginning either on day 0 or day 8 of gestation compared to thermal neutral\nconditions (co nstant 23.3oC) reduced the number of viable embryos by day 30 of\ngestation.  Interestingly, the same heat stress conditions administered on days 53 -61\ndid not affect farrowing performance while heat stress during late gestation (days\n102-110) resulted in a significantly increased number of dead piglets born and a 4\npiglet reduction in the number of piglets born alive (Omtvedt et al., 1971).  However, a\nmore moderate, cyclic heat stress, on bred gilts beginning on day 3 and extended to\neither day 24 or 30 of gestation did not impact embryo survival (Liao and Veum,\n1994).\nLactation:\nHeat stress during lactation can also have a profound impact on production.\nTemperatures exceeding the evaporative critical temperature during lactation\nresulted in reduced feed intake and lowered milk production (Blacket al., 1993).\nElevated core body temperature results in the redirection of blood flow from the\nmammary gland towards the skin in an effort to facilitate heat dissipation.  In\nresponse, lactation and piglet growth (during lactation) are reduced (McGlone et al.,\n1988; Black et al., 1993; Johnston et al., 1999). In addition to reduced performance,\nheat stress during lactation can also reduce the number of sows returning to estrus\nwithin 15 days post weaning (Johnston et al., 1999).\nSemen Quality:\nWhile the effects of heat stress on pig reproduction is notable, it is difficult to\ndistinguish the consequences resulting from heat stress between the male or female.\nWhile it is clear that reproductive parameters in gilt s and sows are affected by heat\nstress, exposure of boars to heat stress can also be detrimental to swine reproduction\nthrough impacts on semen quality.  Boars subjected for heat stress for 90 days (34.5oC\nand 31.0oC for 8 and 16 h per day, respectively) demonstrated reduced motility and\nincreased percentage of abnormal sperm within 2 weeks from the initiation of heat\nstress compared to thermal neutral boars (constant 23oC)(Wettemann et al., 1976).\nUtilization of semen from heat stress boars resulted in reduced number of embryos on\nday 30 post -insemination compared to thermal neutral boars (Wettemann et al.,\n1976).  Similar results were demonstrated by Cameron and Blackshaw in boars\nexposed to heat stress demonstrated a significant increase in abnormal sp erm in 2-3\nweeks following initiation of heat stress (Cameron and Blackshaw, 1980) .131Thermal Stress Effects on Ruminant Reproduction:\nThe physiological effects of heat stress on productivity can be financially devastating\nfor the animal production system s.  During periods of heat stress, dry matter intake\n(DMI) decreases and maintenance requirements increase as livestock attempt to\ndissipate excess heat load (West, 1999) .  In addition, changes in blood flow and the\nproduction of various hormones ultimatel y result in decreased reproductive\nperformance.  During summer months, conception rates can decline by 20 -30%\n(Rensis and Scaramuzzi, 2003) .  This observed reduction in fertility, is attributed to\nseveral factors, including a reduction in estrus detection ability, early embryonic\ndeath, inhibition of follicular dominance, and reduced ovarian steroidogenic output\n(Putneyet al., 1988; Wolfenson et al., 2000; Rensis and Scaramuzzi, 2003) . Thus, heat\nstress has a wide range of reproductive effects beginning wi th the developing follicle\nand continuing through early embryonic development. The biological mechanisms\nthat mediate these effects, however, are not completely understood.\nInevitably, the decrease in DMI that occurs during periods of heat stress is\naccompanied by changes in circulating concentrations of several metabolic hormones.\nIn turn, these metabolic adaptations alter the production and secretion of the\nhormones controlling the reproductive cycle (Wolfenson et al., 2000).  Such\nconsequences are far -reaching and may involve detrimental effects on ovarian\nfollicular development, oocyte competence, early embryonic development and the\nmaternal recognition of pregnancy.\nDuring heat stress, the development of the dominant ovarian follicle is attenuated and\ncirculating concentrations of E 2are lower.  In addition, the luteal phase of heat -\nstressed cattle is extended and follicular wave dynamics are altered (Wilson et al.,\n1998).  These changes in ovarian function appear to be the result of decreased LH\npulseamplitude (Gilad et al., 1993).  As a reminder, LH is directly involved in the\nprocesses of follicular growth, E 2production, ovulation and P 4production.  These\nchanges in LH pulsatility may simply be a consequence of lower feed consumption\nduring heat st ress (nearly a 35% decrease compared to thermal -neutral controls;\n(Rhoads et al., 2007).  Decreased feed intake is associated with changes in circulating\ninsulin, leptin and ghrelin, which have all been shown to affect LH pulsatility in\nseveral species (Szymanski et al., 2007).\nEffects on the Oocyte and Embryo\nPreovulatory oocytes can be damaged directly by heat stress, and indirectly by\nprolonged estrous cycles.  These longer estrous cycles presumably result in the\novulation of an aged oocyte that has r educed potential for developmental competence.\nOocytes contained within antral follicles appear to be the most susceptible to the\ndamaging effects of heat stress.  As a result, conception rates remain depressed132extending into the fall as the oocytes that were damaged during the summer heat\nstress are cleared from the ovary via ovulation or degradation.\nReproductive Impacts of Infection\nLipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a marker of bacterial infection and is elevated in animals\nsuffering from mastitis, as w ell as from leaky gut in the transition period.  Additionally\nand interestingly, LPS is increased in hyperthermic animals.  From a reproductive\nperspective, the LPS -induced poor fecundity phenomena is reported throughout the\nliterature.  Interestingly, fol licular fluid that surrounds and nourishes the maturing\noocyte contains LPS levels reflective of the systemic circulation.  Thus, LPS is reaching\nthe ovary via the systemic circulation and directly interacts with the oocyte\nproportionately as extra -ovariantissues(Herathet al., 2007).\nFolliculogenesis:\nBovine ovarian cortical explants exposed to LPS had reduced numbers of primordial\nfollicles, concomitant with increased atresia of the ovarian reserve (Bromfield and\nSheldon, 2013) .  Similarly, mice expo sed to LPS in vivohad reduced primordial follicle\nnumber which was described as a TLR4 -mediated effect, since Tlr4-/-mice were\nrefractory to LPS -mediated primordial follicle depletion (Bromfield and Sheldon,\n2013).\nSteroidogenesis:\nLPS alters the leve l of anterior pituitary hormones, through direct or indirect\nmechanisms.  Using anestrous ewes as a model, LPS infusion decreased LH but\nstimulated systemic prolactin (PRL) and cortisol levels.  Additionally, mRNA\nabundance of genes encoding LH (LH \u03b2) and the LH receptor (LHR) were reduced by\napproximately 60% in both cases (Herman et al., 2010).  Interestingly, the FSH and\nFSH receptor as well as PRL and PRL receptor genes were increased by LPS infusion\n(Herman et al., 2010).\nLPS exposure did not impact c ell number or androstenedione production from\ncultured theca cells from either small, medium or large ovarian follicles, but did\nreduce the amount of E 2produced from cultured granulosa cells isolated from all\nthree follicular sizes (Williams et al., 2008).  In an in vitrosystem where ovarian\ncortical explants were cultured with LPS and provided with FSH or androstenedione,\nE2and P 4conversion was reduced; potentially due to the observed decreased\nexpression of Cyp19amRNA and protein, an enzyme critical for production of E 2\n(Priceet al., 2013).  Cultured granulosa cells had increased expression of TLR4, likely\nin response to mediating LPS signaling, and negative impacts of LPS on E 2production\nwere demonstrated (Herathet al., 2007).  While no overall im pact of LPS on E 2was133observed in vivo, a temporal decrease in bovine P 4concentrations and lower ovulation\nrates resulted from LPS treatment (Williams et al., 2008).  In agreement with reduced\nE2level, when LPS was infused into the uterine lumen, the pre -ovulatory LH surge was\nattenuated and may be the result of an insufficient stimulation from E2 driving the LH\nsurge(Peteret al., 1989).  Furthermore, LPS -treated females had delays in the time to\nthe LH surge (Fergani et al., 2012).\nIn a regularly c ycling animal, in the absence of fertilization and pregnancy,\nendometrial synthesis and release of PGF2 \u03b1causes CL regression.  LPS itself also\ncauses CL regression by inducing the production of PGF2 \u03b1(Mooreet al., 1991;\nHockettet al., 2000).  LPS admini stration causes delayed ovulation, and lengthens the\ntime to CL formation and sufficient P 4production (Suzukiet al., 2001; Lavon et al.,\n2011).  Additionally, the size of CL are reduced by LPS (Herzoget al., 2012), perhaps\ndue to activation of pro -apoptotic pathways (Herzog et al., 2012).  Interestingly, a\ntemporal pattern of LPS on circulating P 4has been demonstrated, whereby P 4is\ninitially increased and then declines in LPS -treated, relative to their control females\n(Herzoget al., 2012).\nEstrus behavior:\nNot surprisingly both heat stress (Doneyet al., 1973; Sejian et al., 2010)and LPS\n(Battaglia et al., 2000)impact female estrus behavior and frequency.  As in the case of\nthe LH surge, a threshold of E 2is needed to induce behavioral display of estrus,\nhowever the amount required for the latter is thought to be at a lower level\n(Saifullizam et al., 2010).  LPS-induced reductions in E 2production may explain the\nobserved impacts on behavior estrus display since E 2is required for this female\nphenotypic response.\nPre-term labor:\nP4is essential for pregnancy maintenance, and LPS reduces the PR in uteri of pregnant\nmice, thus impacting pregnancy maintenance (Agrawal et al., 2013).  The effect of LPS\non the ability of P4 to sustain gestation could c ause spontaneous abortion, a\nphenotypic event frequently also associated with hyperthermia.  Infection from gram\nnegative bacteria or their outer wall components (LPS) triggers pre -term labor in\nmany species (Koga and Mor, 2010), and, as a testament to the efficacy of LPS at\ninducing preterm labor, intraperitoneal LPS injection is an established experimental\nmodel for inducing pre -term labor (Debet al., 2004; Agrawal et al., 2013).  In addition,\ninfertility can be the result of gynecological infections in both humans and production\nanimals(Williams et al., 2008; Price et al., 2013).134Potential Mitigation Strategies\nAs might be expected, a major effort has gone into designing housing facilities for\nproduction animals that provides shade, misting and fans to cool animals, and these\nefforts have greatly ameliorated the occurrence of hyperthermia induced\nreproductive calamities in production animals.  In addition, it is recognized that heat\nstressed animals do not consume the same amount of feed as their the rmal neutral\ncounterparts, however, \u201coff feed\u201d only accounts for approximately 50% of the heat\nstress-induced alterations to lactation (Baumgard, 2013) , thus likely is also not the\nsole contributor to negative consequences of heat stress of reproduction. Thus,\ngreater research remains to be done to bridge our knowledge gaps in terms of how to\novercome the negative impacts of hyperthermia on reproduction.\nHeat-stressed induced changes in ovarian dynamics ultimately result in unique\nchallenges for reproduc tive management and potentially translating to the production\nof a substandard oocyte.  Many producers now rely on timed artificial insemination\nprograms during periods of heat stress because estrus detection ability is reduced as a\nresult of reduced behav ioral demonstrations of estrus.  Indeed mounting activity\ndeclines by nearly half and is likely the result of lower circulating E 2concentrations.\nExtended luteal phases during periods of heat stress also make it more difficult to\npredict when individual animals will come into estrus.  Timed artificial insemination\nalleviates these challenges by allowing the producer to control the time of ovulation.\nOne management technique has shown promise for overcoming the oocyte -specific\nproblems associated with he at stress.  Conception rates by transferring fresh in vitro-\nproduced embryos into heat stressed cattle (Al -Katanani et al, 2002; Stewart et al.,\n2010).  Used as a management practice, this allows the producer to completely bypass\nthe challenges associated with substandard oocyte quality.  Currently, however, the\nadvantage is only evident with the use of fresh embryos.  Using frozen embryos yields\nconception rates that are similar to those resulting from timed artificial insemination\nduring heat stress.  Thi s presents a logistical challenge since few producers have\naccess to an economical source of fresh in vitro-produced embryos.  The source of the\noocytes is also a concern if the offspring are needed as replacement animals: collecting\noocytes from genetical ly superior females (housed in a cool environment) is more\ncostly, while the least expensive alternative is indiscriminately collecting oocytes from\novaries at the slaughterhouse.  Depending on the geographical region, animals sent to\nthe slaughterhouse va ry widely in breed and genetics, and therefore would not be\ndesirable as replacement animals.  Future advances in in vitroembryo production and\nfreezing will make this technique a more viable alternative for use during periods of\nheat stress.\nThere are a number of other avenues for exploration, however, including improving\nintestinal integrity to prevent \u201ctoxic\u201d compounds from reaching the reproductive\ntract.  Heat stressed animals suffer from hyperinsulinemia (Baumgard, 2013) , a\nbiological paradox since they are consuming less feed.  Systemic hyperinsulinemia\ncould be reduced via pharmaceutical insulin -sensitizing agents, which could lessen\nblood insulin levels.  In addition, compromised PR level and function could perhaps be135overcome through supplementin g with P 4, a strategy routinely used in humans at risk\nfor preterm spontaneous abortion.  These potential avenues for mitigation of\ninfertility that results from exogenous exposures remain reliant on generation of\nscience-based understanding of the problem .\nReferences\nAgrawal, V., Jaiswal, M.K., Jaiswal, Y.K., 2013.

La gen\u00e9tica molecular y la gen\u00f3mica se propon en como tecnolog\u00edas que\nayudaran a alcanzar seguridad alimenticia sostenible. Se discuten las tecnolog\u00edas de\ndesarrollo de marcadores gen\u00e9ticos, mapas gen\u00e9ticos, selecci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica, tecnolog\u00eda\nde secuenciamiento de ADN de nueva generaci\u00f3n y sistemas de edi ci\u00f3n precisa de\nADN que se han desarrollado en la \u00faltima d\u00e9cada y se dan ejemplos de\ndescubrimientos y logros.\nIntroducci\u00f3n\nPara los pa\u00edses en desarrollo el reto de alcanzar seguridad alimenticia es\nprobablemente mucho m\u00e1s complejo y desalentador que e n el siglo pasado. Tenemos\nahora un mundo de aproximadamente 7,000 millones de habitantes en el que se\nestima que 1,000 millones se encuentran subalimentados y un n\u00famero parecido\nsobrealimentados. Esta falta de alimentos para unos y exceso para otros crea serios140problemas de salud humana que dominan la agenda agropecuaria y de salud mundial\ny se constituye en uno de los grandes retos mundiales. Esta situaci\u00f3n se agrava debido\nal hecho de que la poblaci\u00f3n mundial en el 2050 se estima que alcanzara 9,000\nmillones de habitantes y, de acuerdo con estimados de las Naciones Unidas, se\nnecesitara 35% m\u00e1s alimentos, 40% m\u00e1s agua y 50% m\u00e1s energ\u00eda para sostener este\naumento poblacional. Estos incrementos tendr\u00e1n que ser alcanzados en un periodo\ncorto de tiempo con ca si la misma \u00e1rea cultivable que ahora existe en un mundo que\nse enfrenta a cambios clim\u00e1ticos que van a afectar la disponibilidad de agua para\nagricultura y consumo humano entre otros retos. Claramente el futuro demanda\nmejor coordinaci\u00f3n y colaboraci\u00f3n en tre naciones, mejor distribuci\u00f3n de recursos\nalimenticios dentro y entre naciones, e intensificaci\u00f3n sostenible a nivel global de la\nproducci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola (Rothschild and Plastow, 2014). Creemos que los avances\nalcanzados en los \u00faltimos 10 a\u00f1os con la gen\u00e9ti ca molecular y la gen\u00f3mica pueden ser\nusados para desarrollar una producci\u00f3n av\u00edcola y pecuaria m\u00e1s productiva y eficiente\nbasada en planes de mejoramiento gen\u00e9tico y el uso de tecnolog\u00edas reproductivas y de\nedici\u00f3n de ADN (Neeteson -van Nieuwenhoven et al, 2013). El prop\u00f3sito de este\nmanuscrito es proporcionar informaci\u00f3n sobre algunos de estos avances y sugerir su\nuso para desarrollar una pecuaria intensiva sostenible.\nMarcadores Gen\u00e9ticos\nUno de los primeros enfoques de la gen\u00f3mica fue el desarrollo de mapas gen\u00e9ticos\nbasados en marcadores moleculares. Los marcadores m\u00e1s usados para el desarrollo\nde estos mapas han sido los microsat\u00e9lites (MS) y los polimorfismos de nucle\u00f3tidos\nsimples (PNS, el acr\u00f3nimo en Ingl\u00e9s es SNP). Los primeros son secuencias \u00fanic as de\nADN que flanquean un fragmento que puede variar de 2, 3 o 4 nucle\u00f3tidos que se\nrepiten consecutivamente. La variaci\u00f3n en el n\u00famero de repeticiones crea fragmentos\nde diferentes tama\u00f1os y por ende alelos. Las secuencias \u00fanicas que flanquean el MS\nsonusadas para dise\u00f1ar cebadores que permiten amplificar el MS por medio de la\nreacci\u00f3n en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR). Los fragmentos podr\u00e1n visualizarse por\nmedio de su separaci\u00f3n por electroforesis. Los MS pueden tener desde dos alelos a\nm\u00e1s de 15 alelos informativos. Alelos informativos son aquellos que se encuentran con\nuna frecuencia de por lo menos 0.05 en la poblaci\u00f3n.\nLos PNS en cambio son sustituciones de un nucle\u00f3tido por otro en una posici\u00f3n\nespec\u00edfica en un fragmento dado de ADN. A pesar que l os PNSs pueden tener un\nm\u00e1ximo de cuatro alelos en su mayor\u00eda solo se observan dos. Por ejemplo, en un\nfragmento dado de ADN algunos individuos de la poblaci\u00f3n tienen un nucle\u00f3tido,\ndigamos, Citosina, y otros en ese mismo lugar del fragmento de ADN tienen Adenina.\nSin embargo un marcador con dos alelos es un marcador que tiene muy baja\nresoluci\u00f3n porque solo divide la poblaci\u00f3n en dos grupos. Sin embargo debido a la\nabundancia de estos marcadores se pueden hacer agrupaciones de marcadores a lo\nlargo de una hebra de ADN con lo cual se establecen haplotipos (un conjunto\nespecifico de marcadores ordenados consecutivamente en un fragmento de ADN) que\nen conjunto son m\u00e1s informativos (mejor resoluci\u00f3n) y son usados para estudios de\nasociaci\u00f3n con rasgos productiv os cuantitativos. El m\u00e9todo para analizar los PNSs ha141sido automatizado de tal manera que se puede hacer an\u00e1lisis simult\u00e1neo de miles de\nestos marcadores en una sola reacci\u00f3n para cada animal con lo que se obtiene el\ngenotipo PNS del animal pudiendo cubrir m\u00e1s del 95% del genoma.\nMapas Gen\u00e9ticos\nLos marcadores gen\u00e9ticos moleculares fueron generados usando diferentes\nestrategias. Los MS se a\u00edslan de bibliotecas de fragmentos cortos de ADN usando\nsondas con 2, 3 o 4 nucle\u00f3tidos en t\u00e1ndem seguida por secuen ciamiento de los\nfragmentos detectados para identificar secuencias \u00fanicas que flanqueen el MS para\ndise\u00f1ar cebadores de PCR. Los PNS se identifican por secuenciamiento y comparaci\u00f3n\nde las secuencias de fragmentos similares de ADN en grupos de animales de la misma\nespecie. Sin embargo la localizaci\u00f3n de los marcadores a lo largo de ADN de un\ngenoma no se puede saber a menos que se construyan mapas de marcadores\ngen\u00e9ticos. La tecnolog\u00eda para desarrollar los mapas est\u00e1 basada en el an\u00e1lisis de\nligamiento entr e genes y/o marcadores gen\u00e9ticos que fue descrito por Sturtevant\n(1913) cuando construyo el primer mapa cromos\u00f3mico a principios del siglo pasado.\nDos genes est\u00e1n ligados (cercanos) en una misma hebra de ADN cuando la frecuencia\nde recombinaci\u00f3n entre ello s es baja. A menor distancia entre dos genes o\nmarcadores, menor ser\u00e1 la probabilidad de recombinaci\u00f3n o de quiasmas que se\npuedan generar entre ellos durante la divisi\u00f3n celular mei\u00f3tica. Para desarrollar estos\nmapas se tuvieron que generar cruzamientos a propiados entre animales dentro de\nespecie que resultaran en la mayor proporci\u00f3n de meiosis informativas. Tambi\u00e9n se\nusaron sistemas \u201cseudogen\u00e9ticos\u201d (h\u00edbridos de radiaci\u00f3n) para facilitar el\nordenamiento secuencial de los varios miles de marcadores molecu lares que existen\npara cada especie. Contamos en este momento con mapas gen\u00e9ticos de marcadores\nPNS para rumiantes (vacuno, b\u00fafalo, ovino y cabra) no rumiantes (conejo, puerco,\ncaballo), aves (pollo, pavo, pato) entre otras especies de granja. Algunos mapa s son\nm\u00e1s informativos que otros porque contienen m\u00e1s marcadores con distancias\npromedio entre ellos que van desde 7,500 pares de bases (pb) hasta 100,000 pb. De\nuna manera u otra estos mapas han facilitado el ordenamiento de fragmentos de ADN\n(mapas f\u00edsic os) provenientes de bibliotecas de ADN gen\u00f3mico facilitando de esta\nmanera el ordenamiento de secuencias de ADN obtenidas de los proyectos de\nsecuenciamiento de ADN de animales de granja. Para mayor informaci\u00f3n sobre las\nespecies secuenciadas ver las p\u00e1gin as del National Center for Biotechnology\nInformation (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ).Los marcadores moleculares se\nusan para an\u00e1lisis de historia evolutiva, flujo g\u00e9nico, variabilidad gen\u00e9tica, detecci\u00f3n\nde secuencias espec\u00edficas de ADN, mejoramiento gen\u00e9tico, selecci\u00f3n asistida, sistema\nde apareamiento controlado, identificaci\u00f3n de individuos y paternidad entre otros\nusos.142PNS \u201cchips\u201d\nDependiendo del n\u00famero de PNSs disponibles para cada especie se ha n escogido PNSs\nque se encuentran distanciados entre ellos por 3,500 (vacunos) y 54,000 bps (pollo,\novinos, puerco) para generar lo que se conoce como \u201cPNS chips\u201d que son l\u00e1minas\nportaobjetos de microscopio que contienen todos los PNSs escogidos distribuid os,\nordenados y fijados a la l\u00e1mina como puntos microsc\u00f3picos. Cada uno de estos puntos\nmicrosc\u00f3picos contiene una secuencia espec\u00edfica de un PNS el mismo que ser\u00e1\ndetectado por hibridaci\u00f3n de secuencias de ADN del animal siendo genotipado\n(Affimetrix, San ta Clara, CA 95051, USA) or por hibridaci\u00f3n y extensi\u00f3n de la\nsecuencia del PNS basado en la gu\u00eda del ADN del animal siendo genotipado (Illumina,\nSan Diego, CA 92122, USA). El n\u00famero de PNSs en el chip puede ser dise\u00f1ado a\nvoluntad dependiendo del grado de resoluci\u00f3n que se quiera tener. A mayor numero\nde PNS, menor ser\u00e1 la distancia entre ellos y mayor la resoluci\u00f3n y precisi\u00f3n de\nidentificaci\u00f3n de los genes o del segmento de ADN asociado con caracter\u00edsticas\nfenot\u00edpicas. La mayor\u00eda de las investigaciones s obre asociaciones fenot\u00edpicas con\nmarcadores se hacen con \u201cPNS chips\u201d que contienen entre 50,000 y 60,000\nmarcadores.\nMapeo de locide caracteres cuantitativos (QTL)\nEl QTL se entiende como una regi\u00f3n cromos\u00f3mica espec\u00edfica que se ha identificado,\npor m\u00e9todos estad\u00edsticos, estar asociada con un fenotipo cuantitativo. La regi\u00f3n en si\ncontiene uno o varios genes responsables por el control y segregaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica del\nfenotipo. Fundamentalmente el principio en el que se basa la identificaci\u00f3n de un QTL\nes endetectar el desequilibrio de ligamiento que existe entre un gene o genes que\ncontrolan una variable cuantitativa y un marcador o marcadores moleculares en el\ngenoma. La disponibilidad de los \u201cPNS chips\u201d y bases de datos con informaci\u00f3n\ncuantitativa de feno tipos ha permitido identificar QTL para la mayor\u00eda de los\ncaracteres fenot\u00edpicos bajo mejoramiento gen\u00e9tico en algunas especies. En las p\u00e1ginas\nde \u201cAnimalQTLdb\u201d ( http://www.animalgenome.org/cg i-bin/QTLdb/index ) (Zhi-Liang et\nal., 2013; Zhang et al., 2012) se podr\u00e1 encontrar m\u00e1s detalle sobre los QTL espec\u00edficos\npara cada especie estudiada. Solo basta aqu\u00ed con resaltar que 11,543 QTLs\nrepresentando 481 rasgos productivos se han identificado en bovinos; 4,337 QTL\nrepresentando 305 rasgos en pollos; 11,610 QTL representando 649 rasgos en suinos;\n789 QTL representando 217 rasgos en ovinos; 345 QTL representado 9 rasgos en\nequinos y 127 QTL representando 14 rasgos en truchas. Esta informaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 siendo\nusada para estimar el valor gen\u00e9tico de un animal basado en la asociaci\u00f3n de\nmarcadores con rasgos productivos (Meuwissen, et al., 2001).\nSelecci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica en vacunos de leche\nLos aproximadamente 38,000 PNSs informativos que se encuentran asociad os con\nrasgos de producci\u00f3n lechera est\u00e1n distribuidos a lo largo del genoma de cada animal\ny teor\u00e9ticamente el espacio entre cada uno de ellos es de aproximadamente 80,000\nnucle\u00f3tidos. Esto significa que los marcadores PNSs son consecutivos y se encuentra n143relativamente cerca uno del otro. Los progenitores transfieren a sus descendientes\neste ordenamiento. El descendiente, debido a la recombinaci\u00f3n del ADN materno y\npaterno que ocurre en sus c\u00e9lulas reproductivas, transfiere a los nuevos\ndescendientes (o n ietos de los progenitores evaluados) fragmentos del ADN del\nabuelo mezclados con fragmentos de ADN de la abuela. La informaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica que se\nbusca en la evaluaci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica de cada animal es la identificaci\u00f3n de los fragmentos\nde ADN que han sido hereda dos y que est\u00e1n asociados positivamente o negativamente\ncon los rasgos de producci\u00f3n a mejorar. Esto se logra haciendo un an\u00e1lisis de los PNSs\nque cada animal hereda. As\u00ed se obtiene un mapa de marcadores PNS para cada animal\no el genotipo de cada animal y entonces se puede determinar que fragmentos de ADN\nel animal ha heredado de sus ancestros los que a su vez han sido evaluados por\npruebas de progenie o por evaluaci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica. Basados en estudios de asociaci\u00f3n de\nmarcadores y rasgos productivos hechos en una poblaci\u00f3n de referencia se adjudican\nvalores espec\u00edficos a cada fragmento heredado y se obtiene el PTA gen\u00f3mico (GPTA)\npara cada rasgo en evaluaci\u00f3n. Creo apropiado recordar aqu\u00ed que el ordenamiento\nconsecutivo de marcadores PNS que se encuentran en un fragmento de ADN se le\nconoce por el nombre de \u201chaplotipo\u201d. Por lo tanto a cada haplotipo se le da un valor\nque representa su contribuci\u00f3n (positiva o negativa) al rasgo productivo al que est\u00e1\nasociado (Ponce de Le\u00f3n, 2014). La confiabilidad de este estim ado ha sido evaluada y\nse ha determinado que es superior a la confiabilidad del PTA. Van Raden et al., (2009)\nconcluyo que el promedio de confiabilidad obtenido para 28 rasgos de producci\u00f3n\nevaluados en la raza Holstein de EE.UU. fue 23% superior al promed io de\nconfiabilidad solamente basado en el promedio de los padres (PTA). Esta ventaja es\nequivalente a evaluar la producci\u00f3n de once hijas. La confiabilidad aumenta m\u00e1s\ndoblando el n\u00famero de sementales evaluados que incrementando el n\u00famero de\nmarcadores PN Ss. Estas conclusiones se obtuvieron despu\u00e9s de usar las evaluaciones\nobtenidas en agosto del 2003 provenientes de 3,576 toros nacidos antes de 1999 y\nque sirvieron para predecir las desviaciones de producci\u00f3n de las hijas de 1,759 toros\nnacidos entre 1999 y 2002. As\u00ed por ejemplo, la confiabilidad para producci\u00f3n de leche\nbasada en el promedio de los padres fue de 28% y la confiabilidad basada en la\npredicci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica no linear fue de 49%, lo que indica una ventaja del 21%. El rasgo\nque present\u00f3 mayor vent aja fue el rasgo de porcentaje de grasa en el que el promedio\nde los padres alcanz\u00f3 el 25% y la predicci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica un 63%. La raz\u00f3n principal\npara este resultado es la existencia de un gene con efecto mayor. Similares\nevaluaciones y resultados se han obte nido en Australia, Francia y Nueva Zelandia lo\nque estimulo el uso del GPTA en toros con 2 a\u00f1os o menos lo que reduce\nsignificativamente el intervalo generacional y permite duplicar la ganancia gen\u00e9tica\nanual (Hayes et al. 2009). De la misma manera en otro s estudios VanRaden et al.\n(2011) identificaron cinco haplotipos que no se encuentran en forma homocigota en la\npoblaci\u00f3n de animales genotipados de la raza Holstein y que tienen un efecto negativo\nen el porcentaje de concepciones cuando los haplotipos son segregados por el padre y\nel abuelo materno. El porcentaje de animales portadores de estos haplotipos var\u00eda\nentre el 2.7 al 6.4%. Los genes que producen este efecto negativo a\u00fan no se conocen,\nlo \u00fanico que podemos inferir es que en los segmentos de ADN id entificados por estos\nhaplotipos negativos existen algunos genes que cuando est\u00e1n en condici\u00f3n\nhomocigota causan perdidas por baja fertilidad o por muerte embrionaria temprana.144El que existan estos haplotipos negativos no quiere decir que los animales port adores\ndeban ser eliminados como futuros progenitores. M\u00e1s bien, que la informaci\u00f3n con\nque se cuenta sea usada para programar cruzas controladas que no permitan la\nposibilidad de generar individuos homocigotos. Otros ejemplos de esta naturaleza\nexisten en la literatura cient\u00edfica y el conglomerado de instituciones y compa\u00f1\u00edas\nrelacionadas con la industria est\u00e1n proveyendo la informaci\u00f3n a productores tan\npronto como identifican haplotipos detrimentales o negativos.\nSelecci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica en otras especies\nVan Eenennaam et al., (2014) ha publicado una revisi\u00f3n sobre el uso pragm\u00e1tico de\nselecci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica en vacunos (leche y carne), suinos y pollos. Estos autores\nconcluyen que la selecci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica en vacunos de leche es exitosa debido a la\nexistencia de banc os de datos fenot\u00edpicos acumulados a trav\u00e9s de varias d\u00e9cadas de\npruebas de progenie que permiten alcanzar niveles significativos de exactitud y de\nconfiabilidad. En suma las poblaciones de referencia ya exist\u00edan en las bases de datos.\nSin embargo el grado de adopci\u00f3n y uso de la selecci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica por otras industrias\npecuarias y av\u00edcolas estar\u00e1 influenciado por: 1) limitaciones biol\u00f3gicas de la especie,\n2) la estructura de organizaci\u00f3n de la industria, 3) determinaci\u00f3n del tama\u00f1o ideal de\nlas poblaciones de referencias lo que representa una inversi\u00f3n significativa, 4) el\ndesarrollo de estrategias de genotipado econ\u00f3mico y eficiente, 5) la practicidad de su\nimplementaci\u00f3n en el campo, y 6) el costo de la selecci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica en comparaci\u00f3n\ncon los beneficios obtenidos por la ganancia real gen\u00e9tica anual. Por ejemplo el\ngenotipado de PNSs con alta densidad de PNSs en machos seleccionados y baja\ndensidad en hembras est\u00e1 siendo usado con \u00e9xito para imputar genotipos en los\ndescendientes haciendo que la selecci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica sea econ\u00f3micamente m\u00e1s eficiente\npara la industria de suinos y de pollos (Dekkers et al., 2010; McKay, 2009; van der\nSteen et al., 2005).\nTecnolog\u00edas de secuenciaci\u00f3n de nueva generaci\u00f3n\nEn los \u00faltimos cinco a\u00f1os el desarrollo de tecnolog\u00edas de secuenciaci\u00f3n de nueva\ngeneraci\u00f3n (NGS del Ingles, New Generation Sequencing), tambi\u00e9n llamadas de\nsecuenciaci\u00f3n masiva en paralelo permiten obtener entre 1 mill\u00f3n y 43,000 millones\nde lecturas (cada lectura es un fragmento peque\u00f1o de ~ 50 bp a 400 bp) po r\ninstrumento secuenciador en una corrida dependiendo de la plataforma de\nsecuenciaci\u00f3n que se use. El costo de secuenciaci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n ha bajado\nsignificativamente desde $9.00 por mega -base en el a\u00f1o 2001 a aproximadamente $\n0.08 por mega -base en el a\u00f1o 201 4 (National Human Genome Research Institute\nhttp://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/ ). Este hecho permite, a un costo razonable,\nhacer estudios de comparaci\u00f3n de genomas entre animales dentro de una raz a, entre\nrazas y entre especies para detectar variaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica a nivel de genes y secuencias\nreguladoras de genes. Estas tecnolog\u00edas se aplican en el secuenciamiento de novode\ngenomas, re -secuenciaci\u00f3n de \u00e1reas espec\u00edficas del genoma, descubrimiento de\nmarcadores gen\u00e9ticos, descubrimiento de variaci\u00f3n estructural del ADN,145secuenciaci\u00f3n de transcriptomas, secuenciamiento del metiloma, descubrimiento de\nvariantes de ARN, identificaci\u00f3n de smARNs y ncARNs, etc.\nEstas tecnolog\u00edas est\u00e1n revolucionando nuest ro entendimiento de lo que es variaci\u00f3n\ngen\u00f3mica y nos permite descubrir los mecanismos gen\u00e9ticos que gobiernan la\nexpresi\u00f3n de fenotipos que antes solo pod\u00edamos medir cuantitativamente o\ncualitativamente. Por ejemplo, recientemente Pausch et. al. (2014) b asados en\ninvestigaci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica y secuenciamiento profundo de NGS han encontrado en la\nraza Fleckvieh una mutaci\u00f3n sin sentido en el ex\u00f3n 6 del gen que codifica la prote\u00edna\n95 transmembrana que se localiza en la membrana de espermatozoides normales. La\nmutaci\u00f3n consiste en que el cambio de un solo nucle\u00f3tido (PNS) crea un cod\u00f3n de\nterminaci\u00f3n prematuro con lo cual la prote\u00edna queda truncada y no funcional. Esta\nprote\u00edna no se encuentra presente en espermatozoides de animales homocigotos\nrecesivos resultand o en una reducci\u00f3n significativa de fertilidad. De la misma manera\nen la raza vacuna Piedmontesa la mutaci\u00f3n de un nucle\u00f3tido (PNS) en el gen de la\nmiostatina causa hipertrofia muscular que es conocida como el fenotipo de \u201cdoble\nmusculatura\u201d (McPherron y L ee, 1997). Los animales que presentan este fenotipo\ntienen, en promedio, 20% m\u00e1s masa muscular. En el primer ejemplo el gen de la\nprote\u00edna 95 transmembrana ser\u00eda un candidato ideal para corregir en animales elite\nde la raza que presenten ventajas en otros rasgos. En el segundo ejemplo el gen\nmutado de miostatina podr\u00eda ser un gen candidato para introgresi\u00f3n en otras razas.\nTecnolog\u00edas de Edici\u00f3n de ADN\nUna de las maneras de determinar la funci\u00f3n de un gene es alterando la secuencia del\ngene o silenciando de alguna manera la actividad del gene y observando cambios en el\nfenotipo. Con este fin se han desarrollado sistemas que usan enzimas nucleasas para\nefectuar cambios en la secuencia de ADN que permiten reparar y/o mutar un gene o\nsecuencias reguladoras d e genes. Las nucleasas son enzimas que son conocidas como\n\u201ctijeras moleculares\u201d porque permiten cortar la cadena doble del ADN en lugares\nprecisos basados en el reconocimiento de una secuencia espec\u00edfica de ADN que puede\nser le\u00edda por la enzima con la ayud a de una gu\u00eda y despu\u00e9s usar los mecanismos\nend\u00f3genos naturales de recombinaci\u00f3n homologa de la c\u00e9lula para reparar el ADN y\ncopiar la secuencia estipulada en la gu\u00eda como parte del fragmento reparado. A estas\ntecnolog\u00edas se les considera como las m\u00e1s impo rtantes de los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os porque\npermitir\u00e1n hacer lo que se conoce ahora como \u201ccirug\u00eda gen\u00e9tica\u201d y que consiste en la\nedici\u00f3n dirigida de secuencias de ADN en c\u00e9lulas vivas. En la actualidad se usan con\nm\u00e1s frecuencia tres nucleasas que deben ser dise\u00f1ad as para reconocer las secuencias\nespec\u00edficas del ADN a ser editado.\nLa primera nucleasa en ser usada para editar ADN es la conocida como \u201cDedos de\nZinc\u201d (ZFN, del Ingl\u00e9s, Zinc Finger Nuclease). Estas nucleasas consisten en una cadena\nde aproximadamente 3 0 amino\u00e1cidos que reconocen un triplete de nucle\u00f3tidos. En la\nactualidad se han dise\u00f1ado ZFNs que reconocen las 64 combinaciones de tripletes que\nse pueden encontrar en el ADN. Con esto se construyen d\u00edmeros que reconocen 6\nbases o dos tripletes y de esta manera se pueden preparar d\u00edmeros que reconozcan146una secuencia especifica arriba (5\u2019) y otra abajo (3\u2019) de la secuencia que se quiere\nmodificar (Carroll, 2011).\nLa identificaci\u00f3n de las nucleasas conocidas como TALENs (del Ingl\u00e9s, Transcription\nActivator -Like Effector Nucleases) que son semejantes a enzimas activadoras de\ntranscripci\u00f3n act\u00faan en forma similar a las ZNFs. Estas usan bloques de amino\u00e1cidos\npara reconocer un nucle\u00f3tido espec\u00edfico de tal manera que ensamblando varios\nbloques en un orden espec \u00edfico se puede reconocer una secuencia espec\u00edfica en el\nADN. Se necesita entonces dise\u00f1ar un TALEN para reconocer una secuencia especifica\narriba (5\u2019) y otro TALEN para reconocer una secuencia abajo (3\u2019) de la secuencia que\nse quiere modificar (Joung and S ander, 2013).\nLa m\u00e1s reciente nucleasa usada para editar ADN es la que reconoce repeticiones de\nsecuencias cortas palindr\u00f3micas inter -espaciadas y regularmente agrupadas CRISPR\n(del Ingl\u00e9s, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) en el ADN y\nque se asocian con otra enzima conocida como Cas para generar el sistema\nCRISPR/Cas. Este sistema est\u00e1 basado en el uso de ARN que sirve como gu\u00eda para\nreconocer la secuencia especifica de ADN que se quiere editar. La mol\u00e9cula gu\u00eda de\nARN (gARN) que consta de una parte que reconoce a la enzima y otra de\naproximadamente 20 nucle\u00f3tidos que reconoce la secuencia de ADN a editar forma un\ncomplejo enzima/ARN que localiza la secuencia de ADN a editar (Sanger and Joung,\n2014).\nDe los tres sistemas descrito s el que est\u00e1 siendo usado m\u00e1s es el sistema CRISPR/Cas\ncon el que se han logrado modificar genes en c\u00e9lulas vivas y producir animales y\nplantas portadores de los cambios producidos. Tambi\u00e9n se han corregido errores\ngen\u00e9ticos por infusi\u00f3n directa en \u00f3rgano s de animales adultos. Por ejemplo Yin et al.,\n(2014) han logrado mediante inyecci\u00f3n hidrodin\u00e1mica de los componentes del\nsistema CRISPR/Cas corregir la expresi\u00f3n del gene Fahen ~1/250 c\u00e9lulas del h\u00edgado\nde ratones adultos. La expansi\u00f3n de hepatocitos pos itivosFahrescato a los animales\nde la p\u00e9rdida de peso observada cuando el gen no funciona. Este sistema tambi\u00e9n\npermite editar varios locia la vez en un solo embri\u00f3n. La simplicidad, alta eficiencia y\nsu amplitud de aplicabilidad van a permitir dise\u00f1ar experimentos m\u00e1s complejos que\npermitir\u00e1n elucidar interacciones entre genes, cosa bastante dif\u00edcil de hacer hasta el\nmomento. Desde luego que estos sistemas est\u00e1n a\u00fan siendo investigados y mejorados\npara aumentar su precisi\u00f3n y determinar cu\u00e1l es su efect o en el genoma. En el futuro\nlas t\u00e9cnicas de clonaci\u00f3n (Wilmut et al., 1997; Cibelli et al., 1998), edici\u00f3n precisa del\nADN y la informaci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica que se obtiene mediante la secuenciaci\u00f3n del ADN se\ncombinaran para incrementar el mejoramiento gen\u00e9tico m ediante la introducci\u00f3n a\nalelos ben\u00e9ficos de una raza en el genoma de animales elite de otra raza evitando as\u00ed\nla introducci\u00f3n de material gen\u00e9tico no deseado que acompa\u00f1a la introgresi\u00f3n de\nalelos por cruzamiento tradicional (Tan et al., 2012).147Conclusi\u00f3n\nProgresos en gen\u00e9tica molecular y gen\u00f3mica han demostrado su utilidad en el\ndesarrollo de la selecci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica. Esto ha sido posible debido al desarrollo de\nmarcadores moleculares que han permitido identificar segmentos del genoma que\ncontienen genes que controlan rasgos cuantitativos. La aplicaci\u00f3n de la selecci\u00f3n\ngen\u00f3mica en vacunos de leche es, por el momento, la m\u00e1s exitosa. El uso de selecci\u00f3n\ngen\u00f3mica en otras especies est\u00e1 evolucionando y depender\u00e1 de la estructura de\ncrianza y mejoramiento gen \u00e9tico que se aplica a esas especies. Progreso para su uso\ndepender\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n del costo de la aplicaci\u00f3n de la tecnolog\u00eda. La mayor\u00eda de las\nespecies de animales de granja cuentan ya con genomas secuenciados a diferentes\nniveles de profundidad, pero en gener al el nivel de secuenciamiento logrado es\ninformativo y debido al abaratamiento constante de la tecnolog\u00eda de secuenciaci\u00f3n se\nlograra incrementar la resoluci\u00f3n de la que ahora se dispone. Las nuevas tecnolog\u00edas\nde clonaci\u00f3n, edici\u00f3n de ADN, desde que teng an aceptaci\u00f3n social, unidas al\nconocimiento de secuencias de genes y sus variantes al\u00e9licas permitir\u00e1n la\n\u201cintrogresi\u00f3n molecular\u201d de alelos ben\u00e9ficos entre razas y la correcci\u00f3n de alelos\ndetrimentales mutantes. Estas t\u00e9cnicas tambi\u00e9n podr\u00edan ayudar a di sminuir la huella\nambiental de la industria pecuaria. La reducci\u00f3n de generaci\u00f3n de metano, uno de los\ngases que contribuye al efecto de invernadero, en vacunos se obtiene produciendo\nm\u00e1s producto (leche o carne) por animal o se obtiene modificando la flor a del rumen.\nLa gen\u00f3mica en general y la selecci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica en particular podr\u00edan contribuir muy\nr\u00e1pidamente a incrementar de producci\u00f3n lechera por animal as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n\nayudar a entender la composici\u00f3n de la flora del rumen. Por otro lado la modificaci \u00f3n\ndel gen de miostatina en razas productoras de carne a trav\u00e9s de los sistemas de\nedici\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica podr\u00eda aumentar la producci\u00f3n de carne en 20% por animal en estas\nrazas. En ambos casos el volumen de metano producido por unidad de producto\n(litros de lec he o kilos de carne) ser\u00eda menor que el actual con lo que se adquirir\u00eda una\nmayor eficiencia productiva y una reducci\u00f3n significativa de la huella ambiental de la\nindustria pecuaria (Hayes et al., 2013).\nBibliograf\u00eda\nCarroll D.  2011.

Rothschild1and Graham Plastow2\n1Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50014\n2University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada\nSummary\nWhile the \u201cGreen Revolution\u201d has greatly changed production of crops worldwide and\nhelped feed over a billion people, improved production of livestock has been more\nlimited across the globe.  Modern advances in livestock production generally have\nonly benef itted two groups: large scale livestock producers and consumers in the\ndeveloped world.  In some parts of the world many of the animal production practices\nhave not changed for the last 1000 years and in other regions small holders have\nbenefited only marg inally by the scientific advances that now are an integral part of\nlarge scale commercial production.  However, increased food insecurity and a\nworldwide food production crisis loom in the future as the most significant scientific\nchallenge facing us in th e next 30 years.  Expectations are that human population\ngrowth will soon go from 7.3 billion to 9.6 billion by 2050, and food production must\nincrease rapidly to meet the demand.  These increases must come despite evidence of\nclimate change and limited la nd and water resources.  Furthermore, the so called\n\u201clivestock revolution\u201d has fueled a significant increased demand for animal source\nfoods especially in the poorer countries of the developing world where most livestock\nare produced by small holders but a lso in countries like China and Brazil which are\ntransforming quickly.  Many researchers have touted that modern feeding systems,\nadvanced reproductive technologies and advanced genetics and genomics offers\nsolutions to increasing food in the developing wo rld.  These opportunities certainly\nexist, but direction and focus of research, funding issues, human capacity training and\ntraining of small holders will all be required for increasing livestock production.\nThese activities will need to be embedded withi n sustainable programs that address\nimplementation from the outset, and benefiting small holder production will be\ncrucial to meeting this challenge.\nResumen\nEstrategias para mejorar la producci\u00f3n animal en peque\u00f1as crianzas\nMientras que la \"Revoluci\u00f3n Verde\" ha cambiado en gran medida la producci\u00f3n de los\ncultivos en todo el mundo y ha ayudado a alimentar a m\u00e1s de mil millones de151personas, la mejora de la producci\u00f3n de ganado ha sido m\u00e1s limitada en todo el\nmundo. Los avances en la producci\u00f3n de ganado en general, s\u00f3lo han beneficiado a dos\ngrupos: productores a gran escala y consumidores del mundo desarrollado. En\nalgunas partes del mundo, muchas de las pr\u00e1cticas de producci\u00f3n animal no han\ncambiado durante los \u00faltimos 1000 a\u00f1os y en otras regiones los peque\u00f1os\nproductores se han beneficiado s\u00f3lo marginalmente por los avances cient\u00edficos que\nahora son una parte integral de la producci\u00f3n comercial a gran escala. Sin embargo, el\naumento de la inseguridad alimentaria y la crisis mundial de producci\u00f3n de al imentos\nse vislumbra en el futuro como el reto cient\u00edfico m\u00e1s importante al que nos\nenfrentaremos en los pr\u00f3ximos 30 a\u00f1os. Las expectativas son que el crecimiento de la\npoblaci\u00f3n humana crecer\u00e1 de 7.3 billones a 9.6 billones en el 2050, y la producci\u00f3n de\nalimentos debe aumentar r\u00e1pidamente para satisfacer esta demanda. Estos\nincrementos deben ocurrir a pesar de la evidencia del cambio clim\u00e1tico y de los\nrecursos limitados de tierra y agua. Por otra parte, la llamada \"revoluci\u00f3n ganadera\"\nha generado un aum ento importante en la demanda de alimentos de origen animal,\nespecialmente en los pa\u00edses en desarrollo m\u00e1s pobres del mundo, donde la mayor\u00eda\ndel ganado es producido por peque\u00f1os ganaderos, pero tambi\u00e9n en pa\u00edses como China\ny Brasil, que est\u00e1n cambiando r\u00e1 pidamente. Muchos investigadores han pregonado\nque los sistemas de alimentaci\u00f3n modernos, las tecnolog\u00edas reproductivas avanzadas,\nla gen\u00e9tica avanzada y la gen\u00f3mica ofrecen soluciones para aumentar los alimentos en\nel mundo en desarrollo. Ciertamente esta s oportunidades existen, pero la direcci\u00f3n y\nel enfoque de la investigaci\u00f3n, lafinanciaci\u00f3n, la formaci\u00f3n de capacidades humanas y\nla formaci\u00f3n de los peque\u00f1os productores ser\u00e1n necesarios para aumentar la\nproducci\u00f3n ganadera. Estas actividades tendr\u00e1n qu e ser incluidas dentro de\nprogramas sostenibles que abordan desde el principio de su implementaci\u00f3n , yqueel\nbeneficio enla producci\u00f3n de los peque\u00f1os productores ser\u00e1 crucial para enfrentar\neste desaf\u00edo.\nIntroduction\nFor many applied crop and livestoc k researchers, the greatest scientific and moral\nchallenge of the 21stcentury likely will be the challenge of feeding the growing human\npopulation.  Today, it has been estimated that nearly 1 billion people suffer from daily\nhunger and that as many as an additional 1.5 billion people have food insecurity\nissues (Smith et al., 2013).  Estimates further suggest the population will grow from an\nestimated 7.3 billion people (at time of publication,\nhttp://www.worldometers.info/world -population ) to approximately 9.6 billion\npeople in 2050 and food production will have to increase by an additional 50 to 70%\nof today\u2019s production (Ingram et al., 2010).  This, of course, will come with limited\nland and water availability.  Growth in population numbers and increases in Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP) have fueled a livestock revolution (Delgado et al., 1999) since\nthe 1970s.  Total meat consumption has tripled worldwide from 1980 to 2002 (World\nBank, 2009). In the developing world total meat consumption is expected to double\nbetween now and 2050 as will milk consumption, while in the developed world both\nmeat and milk consumption are likely to increase by less than 15% (Thorton, 2009).152The importance of ani mal protein in relation to balanced nutrition and its role in the\nfuture is well described in the review by Ludu and Plastow (2013).\nGiven the present day limited production efficiency of livestock in the developing\nworld drastic increases in production l evels and efficiency will be required to meet\nthese demands.  These increases can be accomplished by increasing livestock\nnumbers very significantly \u2014but with enormous environmental as well as production\nissues/impacts \u2014or by increasing production efficiency per animal.  The latter will be\nessential as these pressures will also apply to the production of crops especially those\nthat are used for feeding both animals and man. A challenge of similar magnitude was\nmet in the developed world (and some advanced dev eloping countries like China and\nBrazil) over the last 75 years, although without the extra constraints of reducing\nresources (land, water, energy) and the impact of climate change.  These increases in\nproduction efficiency have been accomplished in the de veloped world, in large part,\nby improvements in the technologies that are integral to animal production and in the\nadoption of ad libitum feeding in most developed countries.  The impact of these\nefforts, especially genetics, is beautifully demonstrated i n chickens (Havensteen et al.,\n2003) and pigs (Fix et al., 2010) and has been reviewed by others (Hume, Whitelaw\nand Archibald, 2011).\nThis paper is no way meant to be an exhaustive review of all opportunities and\ndifficulties that exist in this area. Rather, the objectives are to define some of the\nopportunities to use existing and new technologies and to address some of the\nlimitations facing use of improved technologies in the developing world by small\nholders. Given the authors\u2019 background much of t he discussion will be centered on\ngenetics and genomics approaches.\nUse of existing technologies\nIn the 20thcentury increases in production traits in all major livestock species have\ntaken place in developed countries largely due to 1) improved nutritio n, 2)ad libitum\navailability of water and feed, 3) increases in genetic merit resulting from genetic\nimprovement programs using advanced quantitative genetic methodology, 4)\nimproved reproductive technologies including wide spread use of AI and embryo\ntransfer and 5) improvements in animal health and disease control (including\nbiosecurity as well as the development of vaccines and other treatments).   Some of\nthese technologies are listed in Table 1.\nFeed technologies to improve production\nIn modern com mercial systems, especially for non -ruminants, feed costs often exceed\nover 40% of the production cost and the two largest feeding factors affecting these\ncosts are 1) quality of the feed and 2) availability of sufficient amounts of feed.  For\nsmall holder s these represent considerable challenges except for ruminant production\nwhere and when small holders have access to good forage.  For other small holders,\nespecially those in peri -urban settings, the cost and availability of sufficient quality153feed is ext remely constraining.  For ruminants many small holders are left to chop\ngrasses and forages from the roadside or from nearby open lots.  Other small holders\nowning chickens or pigs often let the animals scavenge and this causes real\nbiosecurity concerns. M any small holders do not fully understand the concept of\ngrowth and hence to make purchased feeds last longer they feed at levels that\nmaintain the animal\u2019s weight and do not provide the needed feed for increased growth\nand weight gain.  Also improved/form ulated feeds, premixes, mineral and vitamin\nsupplements are not affordable or easy to use for most small producers in developing\ncountries.  Additionally, considerable nutrition advice is required for small holders\nand clearly extension workers with nutrit ional training would be advantageous to\nhelp in ration formulation, and other assistance. If these existing technologies could be\ntransferred at a sustainable and affordable manner then major increases in efficiency\ncould be achieved and food security and economic growth among small holders would\nbe improved.  This suggests that some effort should be applied to making information\nmore accessible and supporting its uptake. For example, using information and\ncommunication technologies that are tailored to the target audience. Radio may be\none of the ways that such knowledge could penetrate in some parts of the world.\nEducating farmers was one of the aims of the BBC in creating The Archers in the early\n1950s (http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/collections/archers_merl.shtml) and\nthis along with web -based video may provide much needed improvements in basic\nhusbandry.\nGenetics and genomics for livestock production\nArtificial selection began with domestication some 10 -15,000 years ago and\ndevelopment of breeds, especially those suited for small holders and livestock keepers\nfollowed.  Such developments depended heavily on selection and other genetic tools\npracticed by mast er breeders and indigenous people. For the developed world,\nadoption of other animal genetics practices such as animal identification, record\nkeeping, selection of fast growing animals to be future parents and the adoption of\nmating systems such as crossbr eeding for heterosis have been highly effective.\nUnfortunately many of these standard practices are not followed or poorly adhered to.\nFor example in many locations where improved livestock are donated by aid agencies\nlocal breeders may use them repeate dly, ignoring inbreeding.  Also, given market\npressures, small holders often sell the fast growing animals first instead of selecting\nand retaining them as future improved parents.  The principles of genetic\nimprovement are relatively simple, however, they do require a disciplined systematic\napproach and this is can be difficult to organize across groups and different\necosystems.  Many of these issues could be resolved with a major education effort to\nimprove the information and its application to specific breeding plans.  One attempt at\nthis is the Community Based Breeding Programs (CBBP) which have sprung up thanks\nto some governmental groups.  These CBBP practice record keeping, selection,\navoidance and inbreeding and group based marketing.  In all these combinations of\nstandard animal genetic practices combined with marketing and health programs\nhave worked well but their sustainability in some regions is tenuous given their cost.154Again human capacity building (see below) would aid in training small hold ers and\nadopting approaches like \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d to further the spread of knowledge would\nbe useful.\nTable 1.

For example, to confirm par entage in systems using\nnatural mating and multiple sires. Advances in genomics are happening at an\nincreasing pace including sequencing, development of large panels of single\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genome wide association studies (GWAS) and\nemploying genomic selection (see Garrick paper in this symposium).  As Hayes et al.155(2013) pointed out, such genomic selection methods are being applied to traits such\nas milk production in cattle and feed efficiency in chickens, cattle and pigs and could\neventually be applied for traits like reduced methane production in cattle (see\nPickering et al., 2013) or even water requirements.  This fine tuning of selection\napproaches using genomics has come after many decades of the use of conventional\ngenetic methods and has been developed in systems that support animal\nidentification, recording of phenotypes, and good -paying reward systems for\nincreased production.\nUnlike milk production in many developed counties, where cows may produce over\n100 liters a day, cows i n some developing countries can only produce 1 \u20132 liters per\nday.  Of course interventions that increase the amount and quality of feed and\navailability of water will be major inputs.  With better environmental conditions,\nimproved genetic quality of livest ock certainly will be advantageous.  This has been\ndemonstrated in countries as diverse as India and Ethiopia (Duncan et al., 2013) and\ncould potentially help address, at least in part, the problems encountered by the\nintroduction of improved breeds from t he developed world.  Improvement through\nuse of genetically superior breeds generally has been perceived as a failure for small\nholders, with genetic potential being lost in these poorer or more challenging\nenvironments.  A better understanding of the gene tic architecture and strengths of\nlocal breeds through genomics also may allow a more precise use of exotic germplasm\nto support these improvement efforts. .  Some groups are looking to see if these tools\ncan be used for the characterization of breeding s tock to help overcome the failure to\nmake systematic improvement by traditional means.  Indeed, this may help unlock\nnew opportunities where trait and pedigree recording is impossible to organize.  The\nprovision of improved sires or semen within CBBP may o vercome this hurdle if\nproper account is taken of factors impacting producer decision making.\nUse of large SNP panels to identify signatures of artificial and natural selection, of\nbenefit in different production settings and environments, are underway in many\nstudies (i.e. Ai et al., 2013).  SNP panels also have been used to examine genetic\ndifferences between cattle in large production herds compared to those of small\nholders (Gorbach et al., 2010).  All these genomic approaches are likely to lead to\ndiscovery of genes or genomic regions associated with increased production for\nbreeds in harsh environments in developing countries.  An initial example is\npreliminary work on Gir cattle from Brazil, where some signatures of selection were\nin regions of th e genome known to contain genes that might be associated with\nadaptation (Liao et al., 2013). Use of genomics in other Latin American cattle\nproduction has also been well explored (Montaldo et al., 2012).  Combined with\ninformation from similar discoveries using improved breeds, genomic solutions\nshould be very useful for improving production efficiency and outputs, provided\nbreeding systems can be developed to ensure application of the improved genetics\n(see later section in this paper and previous paragra ph).\nImprovement in traits affecting climate resilience\nImproving standard production traits, such as milk production, growth rate and\nproduction of total animal protein, are important.  However, climate change is\nexpected to affect animal production sig nificantly, especially for small holders.  These156effects are likely to include limited feed, increased drought, changes in disease\nprevalence and increased incidence of heat stress.  Heat stress reduces production\nefficiency, decreases product outputs, inc reases animal welfare issues and is expected\nto result in significant death losses in some cases (Baumgard and Rhoades, 2013).  For\nheat stress, short -term solutions include building shelters and providing cooling\nmechanisms.  However, in many developing c ountries facilities and management are\noften limited, so solutions to combat climate change can be difficult.  Even so, efforts\nare likely to be needed on all fronts, and this aspect cannot be ignored, especially in\nthe short term.\nLong-term genetic soluti ons may require the use of genomics to identify signatures of\nselection related to heat stress (for example in Bos indicus , Liao et al., 2013) and\nindividual genes associated with mechanisms to combat climate issues.  Research\nexamining climatic stress in sheep and goats (Huson et al., 2013; Elbeltagy et al.,\n2014) has revealed possible signatures of selection. Of particular importance to Peru\nand this region is that South American camelids need further study to determine the\ngenomic regions associated with their resilience.\nSeverity of disease and disease prevalence also are likely to be affected by climate\nchange through the impact of stresses as well as through changes in the geographical\nrange of diseases (Purse et al., 2005).  Long -term solutions also m ay benefit from\ngenomic approaches.  To date most disease resistance research efforts have been\ndevoted to diseases existing in modern production settings, but examples do exist in\nthe developing world, such as resistance to lentiviruses in small ruminants (White and\nKnowles, 2013) that demonstrate the possible power of modern genomic approaches.\nOther examples include the long -term research effort devoted to examining\ndifferences among some native breeds of cattle in Africa for resistance to\nTrypanosoma c ongolense infection, which causes sleeping sickness (Noyes et al.,\n2011).A novel variation on this approach is to examine diseases that exist in the wild\nwithout serious consequences but that affect similar domesticated species.  In all such\ncases, seque ncing of genomes and comparisons among resistant and susceptible\nbreeds or resistant and susceptible species offers hope in understanding the\nunderlying genes responsible for resistance.\nCharacterization and management of genetic resources\nModernizatio n and genetic improvement of many livestock species has led to a limited\nnumber of breeds being used in most production settings and increased losses of local\nnative breeds.  The FAO estimates that there are now 1491 (20%) breeds at risk\nworldwide (FAO, 20 07).  Genomic tools have been used to measure genetic diversity\nand population structure in many studies (see for example Blott et al., 2003, Amaral et\nal., 2008 for pigs).  This work has largely been done in cooperation with scientists\nfrom institutions i n the developed world and hence may reflect their own approaches\nand biases. It has been proposed that such genomic knowledge would be useful for\ndesigning effective strategies for management and conservation of farm animal\ngenetic resources (FAO, 2007). Measures of allelic differences between populations\n(i.e., Fst) often have been employed using a limited number of highly polymorphic\nmicrosatellites which have been less expensive for developing country research\nbudgets.  Good reviews on this subject have been presented (e.g. Lenstra et al., 2012).157However, with the advent of genome sequencing and the production of thousands of\nSNPs, and the subsequent development of SNP chips, researchers routinely employ\nthem for genetic diversity and GWAS. Researchers are now more effectively\ncomparing different breeds/populations from different geographical regions\n(sometimes called landscape genomics).  In turn this should provide them with more\naccurate measures of genetic diversity, architecture and perhaps natural selection for\nlocal environments.  Although signatures of selection relating to local adaptations may\nbe identified (see below), in general these studies need to be allied to industry efforts\nto characterize the different aspects of performance in these en vironments. Clearly if\nbreed conservation is to be maintained then cost of genomic evaluation efforts must\nbe funded and performance of conserved breeds must be of economic value to all\nlivestock producers.\nReproductive technologies and interventions\nReproductive technologies have greatly advanced animal improvement by generally\nmaking it possible to use fewer select animals to produce the next generation.  In\ndoing so the genetically superior animals can be used more widely.  For small holders,\nespecially dairy producers, use of artificial insemination (AI) and superior bulls for\nmilk production could greatly increase production ability.  Of course this must be\ncoupled with improvements in the production environment.  Other advances, such as\nembryo trans fer (ET) can allow for the ability to multiply significant numbers of\nsuperior embryos for production.  In many countries in South and Central America\nincreased use of AI and ET have been very successful.  Development of CBBP to help in\nsemen distribution can certainly be useful for small producers.  Many production\nsystems for cattle are both meat and milk and hence extra male calves have value.\nHowever, sexed semen would be particularly beneficial for small producers trying to\nproduce only heifers to inc rease milk production.\nOther technologies such as timed insemination and synchronized estrus have\nbenefit for many larger operations but may in the near future be useful for small\nproducers who wish to share males for breeding.  Again a CBBP may be most h elpful.\nDisease reduction and health improvement\nMost animal production units in the developing world are operated by small holder\nfamers with extremely limited resources and limited access to proper affordable\nveterinary care.  Many shelters are poor and have little or no biosecurity enforcement\nand poor environmental control.  In many cases animals are not separated from their\nwaste and live on earthen floors which allows continual parasite problems.  Removal\nof these problems and increased biosecurit y will go a long way towards increasing\nanimal production efficiency for small holders. Many of these diseases also are\nzoonotic, and hence as many as a 1 billion livestock keepers are at risk worldwide\n(Grace et al., 2012).  One strand of thought is that many of these problems can be\naddressed by increasing the pace of intensification. This would help address the issue\nof disease and rapidly increase the availability of animal protein through improved\nefficiency.  However, it is not clear if this can be ac hieved on sufficient scale or in a158short enough time to overcome problems of disease spread between the sectors, or\nthe social issues that would be faced as the structure of communities is changed.\nAlthough some of the production gap will be addressed in this way through large scale\nintensification and increased biosecurity (e.g. as seen in Brazil and China), more\nsustainable change is likely to be delivered by small holders.  Therefore, protection\nfrom pathogens is extremely important and requires accurat e assessment of the\npathogen itself as well as the possible development of an inexpensive and efficacious\nvaccine that can be delivered in these environments and situations.  The use of\ngenomics, in particular, new methods of sequencing, to more effectivel y identify the\nstrain of a pathogen and to help in the isolation of specific antigens for development of\nnew and more effective vaccines has been proposed.  Tracing the source of the\npathogen and monitoring its spread over regions also can be effective in future\ndisease prevention strategies.\nGenetic engineering of livestock\nThe introduction of genetically modified crops (GMOs) has revolutionized plant\nagriculture, at least in some parts of the world.  Even so, there continues to be\nresistance to the tech nology, especially in Europe and even for a product such as\nGolden Rice, which was designed to help improve the lives of the poor in the\ndeveloping world.  Resistance to the engineering of food animals has been even\ngreater for a number of reasons, includi ng animal welfare.  However, genetic\nmanipulation provides the potential to make genetic changes that may be impossible\nthrough other approaches, at least in relatively short time frames.  An area of great\nopportunity and potential benefit for this technol ogy is therefore in animal health and\ndisease resistance.  For example, the development of chickens resistant to avian flu or\nthose that reduce the spread of the disease, could have a huge impact on the\neconomics and supply of chicken as well as potentiall y playing a significant role in\nreducing the threat of a flu pandemic (Lyall et al., 2011).  Other opportunities include\nthe production of Trypanomiasis -resistant cattle or animals resistant to African Swine\nFever which have the potential to revolutionize the lives of small holders in parts of\nAfrica where these diseases are endemic.  The development of new tools and\ntechnologies mean that these changes can be introduced more precisely and more\nefficiently than ever before (Tan et al., 2012).  Results from genomic studies, for\nexample those investigating different breeds and species, will provide new targets for\nsuch manipulation to help improve the suitability of genetics for many of the\nenvironmental challenges faced in the developing world and can remove some of the\nproblems in organizing improved animal production.  However, it will not be enough\nthat we can create these potential solutions.  In addition, proactive efforts to win\napproval will be required to ensure the acceptability of such solutions wher e they are\nneeded.159Implementation of technology solutions\nCriteria have been suggested to evaluate the performance of livestock -related\nprojects.  These include \u201c1) relevance of projects to the poor, and to national and local\ndevelopment objectives; 2) extent of satisfaction of project objectives through\nsuccessful completion of activities; 3) sustainability in delivery of project benefits; 4)\nmarket access and utilization enabled by the project; and 5) value addition enabled by\nthe project\u201d ( Wanyoike andBaker,2013).  Such criteria should be applied to\napplications of technology to livestock improvement and production.\nHow will this be achieved?  At present a large dairy cattle evaluation project, funded\nby the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is und erway using SNP genotyping panels to\ndetermine genomically what is the \u201cbest\u201d breed/genotype combinations for\nproduction in sub -Saharan Africa, and recently has been extended to include Ethiopia\nand Tanzania.  Similar efforts are underway for goats through partnerships with\nEuropean and US scientists (Huson et al., 2013).  Assuming that the best genotypes\ncan be identified, how then will they be delivered?  In the developed world, recording\nsystems, animal identification, breeding companies and artificial i nsemination\ncompanies exist to deliver improved sires, provide embryos for transfer or make\nplanned matings.  Such industrial infrastructure as has been discussed is lacking in the\npoorest countries of the developing world, even though governments attempt to put\nthis infrastructure in place.  Even if breeding systems can be developed and semen\nfrom genomically improved sires become available, improvements may fail to reach\nsmall holders due to lack of physical infrastructure including insufficient stores of\nliquid nitrogen, AI tools, quality roads and transportation services.  The lack of clear\npaths to market can also mean that technological solutions will fail.  Clearly industry\nand government need to work together to support such efforts.\nUse of technolog y to develop better vaccines offers real promise, but impediments do\nexist in many poor developing countries.  Because many vaccines require refrigeration\nand cold chain storage is unlikely in many developing countries, therefore vaccines\nnot requiring ref rigeration ensure higher use and efficacy.  The manufacturing of high -\nquality biologics and vaccines also may be an impediment since these require\nconsiderable technological advances.  Furthermore counterfeit vaccines and drugs in\nsome regions of the world are a real problem.  These aspects also are true for human\nhealth, and attention should be paid to understanding how these issues are being\naddressed in this arena \u2014to transfer learning to agricultural issues.  Finally many of\nthe very poor developing coun tries may view technology solutions as genetic\nengineering and may have policies that are not supportive.  Similar problems may be\nencountered for technologies such as genome editing, which some researchers\nconsider to be outside of the definition of genet ically modified organisms (GMOs).\nThese are the sort of considerations that need to be dealt with proactively by cross -\ndisciplinary teams and by utilizing new opportunities for communicating with\nconsumers.  In summary, if technology improvements are to b e realized,\ninfrastructure and policy considerations, as well as communication, need to be\nincluded in long -range planning and implementation.  Planning for adoption should be\npart of all research proposals in this area of development.160Other issues for c onsideration\nA number of other important considerations will affect the application of technology\nto improvement of livestock production in developing countries.  Long -term strategies\nto circumvent these possible roadblocks are required.\nResearch funding\nThe agricultural research enterprise in most developed countries has limited funding\nbut far outpaces that of developing countries.  It has been estimated that high -and\nmiddle-income countries account for nearly 90% of all investment in agricultural\nresearch and development (Beitema and Stads, 2010).  Such funding often is a mix of\nbasic and applied research efforts.  This is further complicated by the realization that\nlarger investments are often directed toward the plant sciences than the animal\nsciences.  This fact is even more pronounced in research devoted to agricultural\nimprovement in the poorer developing countries (e.g. excluding Brazil and China).\nWhile not officially published or known it has been estimated that less than 20% of\nthe several ag encies and foundations (e.g. US Agency for International Development\nand the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) agricultural research efforts are devoted\nto animal -related research.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently created\nan enlarged team d edicated to livestock and revised its priorities.\nData from other countries and donors are limited, but until there are increases in\nanimal agricultural research funding, improvements, especially as they relate to\nanimal production research for developing countries, are likely to lag.  Even so,\ncountries such as the US, Canada and the UK are beginning to recognize the\nimportance of food security and that this extends beyond their own borders.  After all,\nmore than ever, having sufficient food is one of the elements that contributes to\nstability, and ultimately security, across today\u2019s connected world.\nNeed for human and institutional capacity building\nTechnological advances for example in the field of genomics have been quickly\nadopted in the developed worl d as witnessed by the use of animal breeding\ntechnologies, SNP chips, GWAS, genomic selection and sequencing for most species\nand in many of the livestock industries (Hayes et al., 2013).  Such developments\nrequire well -trained scientists and laboratories to support their activities, and these\nadvances traditionally have been supported by and developed in strong universities\nand government agricultural research units.\nIn the developing world, large investments in higher education were made from the\n1960s to the 1990s by donors such as USAID, the Rockefeller Foundation and the\nWorld Bank, but in recent years investments have declined and the negative effects\nare obvious.  In many cases, with the numbers of students in these countries\nincreasingly coupled with lack of support, quality has declined (Mouton, 2008b).  The\nNational Agricultural Research Systems (NARSs) or other government research\norganizations, called National Agricultural Research Institutes (NARIs), in many\ndeveloping countries provide the major ity of the agricultural research (Pardey and\nAlson, 2010).  The NARS and NARIs both suffer in many countries from aging staff, few\nfemale staff, limited funding and old facilities (Pardey and Alson, 2010).  Although161international research organizations, su ch as the Consultative Group on International\nAgricultural Research (CGIAR) cover many important crops and animal issues they\ncannot make up for limited institutional and human capacity deficiencies.  Again, these\nissues have been recognized and are at lea st being built into plans, especially in\nfunding from agencies like USAID in the US and in efforts with CGIAR.\nThe advancement and adoption of modern technologies will require research\ninstitutions and an increasing number of significantly better trained individuals with\nadvanced degrees, and such training likely will need to occur in the US and other\ndeveloped countries or be addressed by new ways of developing these resources in\nsitu.  This also will necessitate that these trained scientists return to a nd/or remain in\ntheir home countries to help train small holders, food producers and the next\ngeneration of researchers and farmers.  There are opportunities to use new\ncommunication tools to support these efforts as well as to identify existing\napproaches that have worked in the past (see above).  Other activities that could\nadvance the ability to employ modern technologies include technical assistance,\nmentoring, workshops, conferences (like this Ensminger conference), study tours\n(especially those aimed at providing training of future trainers), institutional linkages\nand increased access to the internet for webinars, publications and technical\ninformation.  Many donors are increasing support for such capacity -building activities,\nalthough support of thos e activities related to livestock research lags behind that of\ncrops.  These and other issues are beginning to be recognized along with the need for\ndevelopments and initiatives that are \u201crelatively simple, cheap and low -risk\u201d as set out\nby Rege et al. (20 11).\nMarket Access\nEven with advanced technology, improved nutrition and access to better health care,\nsmall holders still suffer from lack of market access.  Government intervention to\ninsure proper roads, facilities to slaughter animals and provide saf e post-harvest\nhandling are all required. This will even the \u201cplaying field\u201d for all farms, small and\nlarge, alike.\nConclusions\nBy 2050 the need to feed 2 more billion people will require 50 \u201370% more food\nproduction, and there will be a significant incre ase in demand for animal sourced\nfoods.  Limitations in land and water and climate change issues will challenge\nlivestock producers, especially small holders worldwide.  The biological sciences in\nthe 21stcentury already have been transformed by new techn ologies and their\napplications to agriculture.  However, these changes have affected largely only those\nwho live in the developed world.  Employing technology generated solutions to\nincrease livestock production efficiency in the developing world to meet t hese\ndemands will be required.  Opportunities for such solutions are many and include all\naspects of livestock production.  Delivery of many of these solutions in these\nproduction settings, especially in the case of breeding programs involving improved\nlivestock, have yet to be developed and will require novel solutions.  Although, there162has been a general belief in the power of technology to rescue humanity, time is short\nand there is evidence that attitudes are changing.  Technology itself will not provid e\nall of the answers.  Instead, we need to look at all aspects, from animal production to\nfood distribution and international trade. This includes improving our understanding\nof small holder and consumer attitudes and their impact on adoption and purchasin g\ndecisions.  Additionally, improved development of human and institutional capacities\nalso will be required. The challenges are many, but the need to feed a hungry world\nwill require that all animal producers, scientists, social scientists, funding agenci es\nand policy makers work together to find solutions.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors acknowledges that many of the ideas have been previously expressed in\nRothschild and Plastow (2014).
