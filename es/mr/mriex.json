Ayurveda is an ancient and proven system from India for creating balance and vibrant health. This app by Meditation Oasis\u2122 provides an easy way to apply the principles of healthy eating from Ayurveda to our everyday food choices.\nAccording to Ayurveda, the qualities of your mind and body are determined by three biological \"energies\" or principles called \"doshas\" -- vata, pitta and kapha. Each individual has a unique combination of these three bio-energies that result in their mind-body type or constitution. By determining your basic constitution and assessing your current imbalances, you will be able to modify your diet to create greater balance.\nApp Features:\nBasic Constitution Quiz to help you easily determine your mind-body type\nCurrent Imbalance Quiz to find out your dosha imbalances\nExtensive Food Properties Table of over 150 items giving each food's properties and suitability for your mind-body type\nDetailed instructions for choosing the right foods to balance the doshas\nA Dosha Clock that automatically shows the dosha for the season and time of day\nSample food plans for people with three different constitutions\nEating Tips for good digestion\nThe benefits of following an Ayurvedic diet are:\nmore energy\nbetter digestion\nnormalization of body weight\nimproved overall health and well-being\nclarity of mind\nThe information in this app is based on ancient Ayurvedic texts and the experience of over 25 years of applying these principles to daily life. Richard Maddux studied Ayurveda in India with Vaidya V. M. Dwivedi, Vaidya B. D. Triguna, and Vaidya Balraj Maharishi.\nWhat\u2019s New\nVersion 3.0\nUpdated for iOS7. Improved interface.\nRatings and Reviews\nToo simple\nThe app is very simplistic in describing Ayurvedic principles. I wish I wouldn't have paid $1.99, it should have been free.\nI gave it 3 stars instead of 2 because it was a \"fun\" app. Even though the content is reliable, this app is not to be taken seriously. It is definitely not for those who are looking for extensive information.\nSuggestion: the app belongs in the \"free\" purchases category.\nGreat app, except...\nLove the app, but on some of the screens (e.g., the quiz results screen), the info at the bottom is cut off and there is no scroll option. Please fix this.\nGreat for beginners\nIf you want to take the first step into learning the basics of Ayurvedic Doshas, this is the app for you. Obviously you won\u2019t become an expert through an app, but you can begin to raise awareness through research.
