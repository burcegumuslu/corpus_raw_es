Visite www.immunize.org/vis\n 1 Why get vaccinated?\nDiphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are serious diseases \ncaused by bacteria. Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person. Tetanus enters the body through cuts or wounds.\nDIPHTHERIA causes a thick covering in the back of \nthe throat.\u2022\tIt can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, and even death.\nTETANUS (Lockjaw) causes painful tightening of the \nmuscles, usually all over the body.\u2022\tIt can lead to \u201clocking\u201d of the jaw so the victim cannot open his mouth or swallow. Tetanus leads to death in up to 2 out of 10 cases.\nPERTUSSIS (Whooping Cough) causes coughing \nspells so bad that it is hard for infants to eat, drink, or breathe. These spells can last for weeks.\u2022\tIt can lead to pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring spells), brain damage, and death.\nDiphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine (DTaP) can help prevent these diseases. Most children who are vaccinated with DTaP will be protected throughout childhood. Many more children would get these diseases if we stopped vaccinating.\nDTaP is a safer version of an older vaccine called DTP. \nDTP is no longer used in the United States.\n 2  Who should get DTaP vaccine and when?\nChildren should get 5 doses of DTaP vaccine, one dose at each of the following ages:\n\u2022\t2 months\n\u2022\t4 months\n\u2022\t6 months\n\u2022\t15\u201318 months\n\u2022\t4\u20136 years\nDTaP may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 3  Some children should not get \nDTaP vaccine or should wait\n\u2022\tChildren with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But children who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting DTaP vaccine.\n\u2022\tAny child who had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of DTaP should not get another dose.\n\u2022\tAny child who suffered a brain or nervous system disease within 7 days after a dose of DTaP should not get another dose.\n\u2022\tTalk with your doctor if your child:\n- had a seizure or collapsed after a dose of DTaP,- cried non-stop for 3 hours or more after a dose of \nDTaP, \n- had a fever over 105\u00b0F after a dose of DTaP. \nAsk your doctor for more information. Some of these children should not get another dose of pertussis vaccine, but may get a vaccine without pertussis, called DT.\n 4 Older children and adults\nDTaP is not licensed for adolescents, adults, or children \n7 years of age and older.\nBut older people still need protection. A vaccine called Tdap is similar to DTaP. A single dose of Tdap is recommended for people 11 through 64 years of age. Another vaccine, called Td, protects against tetanus \nand diphtheria, but not pertussis. It is recommended every 10 years. There are separate Vaccine Information Statements for these vaccines. 5  What are the risks from DTaP \nvaccine?\nGetting diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis disease is much riskier than getting DTaP vaccine.\nHowever, a vaccine, like any medicine, is capable \nof causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of DTaP vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.\nMild problems (common)\n\u2022\tFever (up to about 1 child in 4)\n\u2022\tRedness or swelling where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4)\n\u2022\tSoreness or tenderness where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4)\nThese problems occur more often after the 4th and 5th doses of the DTaP series than after earlier doses. Sometimes the 4th or 5th dose of DTaP vaccine is followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg in which the shot was given, lasting 1\u20137 days (up to about 1 child in 30).\nOther mild problems include:\n\u2022\tFussiness (up to about 1 child in 3)\n\u2022\tTiredness or poor appetite (up to about 1 child in 10)\n\u2022\tV omiting (up to about 1 child in 50)\nThese problems generally occur 1\u20133 days after the shot.\nModerate problems (uncommon)\n\u2022\tSeizure (jerking or staring) (about 1 child out of 14,000)\n\u2022\tNon-stop crying, for 3 hours or more (up to about \n1 child out of 1,000)\n\u2022\tHigh fever, over 105\u00b0F (about 1 child out of 16,000)\nSevere problems (very rare)\u2022\tSerious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses)\n\u2022\tSeveral other severe problems have been reported after DTaP vaccine. These include:\n- Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness- Permanent brain damage.\nThese are so rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine.\nControlling fever is especially important for children who have had seizures, for any reason. It is also important if another family member has had seizures. You can reduce fever and pain by giving your child an aspirin-free pain reliever when the shot is given, and for the next 24 hours, following the package instructions. 6  What if there is a serious reaction?\nWhat should I look for?\u2022\tLook for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.\nSigns of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, \nswelling\tof\tthe\tface\tand\tthroat,\tdifficulty\tbreathing, \t\na fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These \nwould start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.\nWhat should I do?\u2022\tIf you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can\u2019t wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.\n\u2022\tAfterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). \nYour\tdoctor\tmight\tfile\tthis\treport,\tor\tyou\tcan\t\ndo it yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967.\nVAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice.\n 7  The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program\nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines.\nPersons who believe they may have been injured by a \nvaccine\tcan\tlearn\tabout\tthe\tprogram\tand\tabout\tfiling\ta\t\nclaim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP \nwebsite at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation.\n 8 How can I learn more?\n\u2022\tAsk your doctor.\n\u2022\tCall your local or state health department.\n\u2022\tContact the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC):- Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO ) or\n- Visit CDC\u2019s website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines\n  Vaccine Information Statement\n DTaP Vaccine\n  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-265/17/2007Office Use OnlyCHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM       Routine VFC Contact Form  \nVFC Pin  \n \n Date  Start Time  \nProvider  Site Name  \n \n Contact  End Time  \nAddress  \n \n Zip Code  Phone  PHA  \nPurpose of Visit and Outcome   Recommended  \nCorrective Actions  Follow -Up Date  \n \n1.

Program \nimplementation began on October 1, 1994. Funds are annually \ntransferred to the program from the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services (CMS) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and awarded to 64 immunization projects. The VFC \nProgram is one of the largest private- public partnerships in the US.  \nThe Illinois Department of Health care and Fa mily Services ( HFS) \nreimburses providers for the administration of each vaccine to Medicaid-\nenrolled children, but does not reimburse for the cost of the vaccines that ar e available through the VFC P rogram.  Therefore, providers who \nserve Medicaid enrolled children must be enrolled in the VFC Program .  \nThe VFC Program removes vaccine cost as a barrier to immunization \nfor eligible children, reduces referral s to public \nclinics for immunization, and facilitates children  \nremaining in  a medical home for comprehensive \ncare.  The program promotes implementation of \nnew vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).   \n \nThe federal VFC Program provides publicly -purchased vaccines from \nbirth through 18 years of age for children who are:  \n\u2022 Medicaid enrolled (including Medicaid managed care \nplans)  \n\u2022 Uninsured (have no health insurance  coverage)  \n\u2022 American Indian  or Alaskan Native  \n\u2022 Underinsured (only at Federally Qualified Health Centers)  Section  \n1 \nT \nThe VFC Program \nsaves parent s and \nenrolled providers \nthousands of \ndollars per child in \nout-of-pocket \nexpenses for \nvaccine.  \nVFC Program Introduction  \nSection 1 \u2013 Page 1 (Rev. 01/2014)  CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \n\u2022 Underinsured - For the purposes of determining eligibility \nfor VFC, children are considered to be underinsured if the \nchild has health insurance that does not pay for the cost of the vaccine.  \n \nFor more information about the VFC program, please visit the CDC \nwebsite at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/default.htm   \nVFC Program Introduction  \nSection 1 \u2013 Page 2 (Rev. 01/2014)  CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nProvider Enrollment, \nRequirements and \nResponsibilities  \nEnrollment  \nhe VFC Provider Agreement  outlines  basic information about \nparticipation in the Chicago VFC Program and establishes an \nagreement between the provider and the VFC program.  In \naddition, the agreement  requests  information about  all physicians \nprescribing immunizations  within the practice and general inform ation \nabout the overall clinic . It is required that the physician with overall \nresponsibility  for the clinic \u2019s use of VFC vaccine completes and sign s \nthe forms . The practitioner will also be held accountable for compliance \nby the entire organization and its employed staff with the responsibilities  \noutlined in the Provider Agreement.  The physician\u2019s name should also \nbe typed or printed in the box next to the signature. All enrolled \nproviders are verified through HFS for eligibility to participate in the VFC \nProgram . Medical license  and National Provider I dentif ication  (NPI) \nnumbers must be submitted for this verification process.   \n \nEvery step of the VFC Program is intended to be as simple \nas possible for the provider, while ensuring that standards for eligibility and vaccine accountability are maintained. To enroll in the Chicago VFC Program, a provider is required to:  \n1. Com plete the VFC Provider Enrollment form  \n2. Agree to comply with all stated policies and procedures as  outlined \nin this handbook  by signing and dating the Provider Agreement  \n3. Complete the Provider List  (listing of all providers with prescriptive \nauthority treating and seeing VFC eligible children)  \n4. Complete the Provider  Profile Form  \n5. Complete the Policy  Acknowledgement Certification Form   Section  \n2 \nT \nProvider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities  \nSection 2 \u2013 Page 1 (Rev. 01/201 4) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nIf a provider maintains multiple clinical sites, each sit e must be \nenrolled separately. Each site will order and receive vaccine \nseparatel y and may not transfer vaccine between sites.  \n \nProviders maintain control  of who they accept as patients.  Therefore, a  \nprivate health care provider is not  required to accept a child into his or \nher practice  merely because the child is eligible for VFC vac cines.   \nTo enroll in  the Chicago VFC  Program , a representative from the  \nprogram will schedule a visit to the provider\u2019s  \nsite. This visit has three purposes: (1) t o \nprovide information about VFC policies and procedures, (2) to inspect the refrigerators and  \nfreezers to be us ed for vaccine storage, and (3) \nto provide VFC training to the on- site \ndesignated Vaccine Coordinator and the back -\nup Vaccine Coordinator . The  site visit and the \ncompleted VFC Provider Enrollment , Provider \nAgreement , and P rovider  Profile Form are \nrequir ed to complete the enrollment process . \nThe documents listed above must contain an \noriginal signature; signat ure stamps are not acceptable. Faxed copies \nmay be used to initiate the enrollment process, but the signed originals must follow before the first vaccine order is processed. If the \ndocuments are compl eted during the site visit, the VFC representative \nwill collect them  to finalize enrollment.  If the forms are not completed at \nthis visit, the Provider Enrollment , Provider Agreement, and Provider  \nProfile Form  should be mailed to the Chicago VFC Program, where \nthey will be kept on file.   \nThe Provider  Profile Form  must be completed for individual public and \nprivate facilities approved by the Chicago VFC Program for participation \nin the VFC  Program.  The Provider  Profile  Form helps  the Chicago VFC \nProgram determine the amount of vaccine to be supplied through the \nprogram. This form is also used to compare estimated vaccine needs \nwith actual vaccine supply.   \nAnnual Reenrollment (Recertificati on) \nThe Chicago VFC Program requires  that the health care \nproviders annually renew the VFC Provider Enrollment Form  \nand the Provider Profile Form . Profile numbers are generated for \neach site by VFC for providers\u2019 use based on vaccines ordered \nthe previous year by the provider.  The Provider  Profile  Form  and As of 2014, ne w \nproviders are \nrequired to have a \nstand -alone \nfreezer and one \nmonth of \ntemperature data \nbefore receiving \nVFC vaccine.  \nProvider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities  \nSection 2 \u2013 Page 2 (Rev. 01/201 4) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nProvider Agreement  will be updated annually , or when there is a \nchange in the practice and estimates of children served changes , or the \nstatus of the facility changes . \n \n \nChange of Status  \nAny time there is a change in the physician(s) \nwithin the clinic , if the clinic  moves to another \nlocation or if the clinic is sold to another \nhealth care facility, the current provider  must \nnotify the Chicago VFC Program with that \ninformation  at least two weeks  before  the \ntransition takes place.  \nIf the provider decides to close the clinic  or to dis -enroll  from the \nVFC P rogram , the provider must contact the Chicago VFC  \nProgram  as soon as possible.  Arrangements will be made to pick \nup remaining doses of VFC vaccines , retur n VFC equipment  and \ncollect any outstanding accountability information.  \nRequirements and Responsibilities  \nProviders participating in the VFC Program must agree to comply with the following requirements:  \n \n1. Annually submit a provider profile representing populations served by the practice or more frequently if the 1)number of children changes or 2)the status of the facility changes during the calendar year.  \n2. Screen all patient s (birth through 18 years of age)  at each \nimmunization encounter to determine VFC el igibility in one of the \nfollowing categories:  \n \na. American Indian or Alaskan Native;  \nb. Enrolled in Medicaid or Medicaid managed care-  children \nwho are insured by All Kids, the Illinois State Children\u2019s Healthcare Program (S -CHIP) are considered VFC eligible \nin 2014;  \nc. Uninsured (no health insurance coverage)  or self -pay; \nd. As of 10.1. 2016, S-CHIP (Title XXI) children are not VFC \neligible .  V accine supplied to them will need to be \npurchased privately and maintained separately.  Children with \nprivate \ninsurance that \ncovers \nimmunizations \ncannot receive \nVFC vaccines.  \nProviders must  \nuse privately \npurchased \nvaccines.  The provider is \nresponsible for \nnotifying the Chicago \nVFC Program of any  \nchanges in the \nenrollment  \ninformation as soon \nas changes occur.  \n \nProvider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities  \nSection 2 \u2013 Page 3 (Rev. 01/201 4) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \ne.

Ensure that a vaccine administration charge ( for va ccines to non-\nMedicaid VFC -eligible children only)  does not exceed the fee cap \nof $23.87 per vaccine dose, not antigen. For Medicaid VFC-\neligible children, a provider must accept th e reimbursement for \nvaccine administration set by the state Medicaid agency or the contracted Medicaid health plan.  Medicaid patients  cannot be \ncharged an administration fee.  \n \n7. Ensure that VFC -eligible children are not denied administration of \nfederally pur chased vaccines because child\u2019s \nparent/guardian/ patient  is unable to pay the administration fee.  \n \n8.

Participation will include, but not be limited to, documenting patients with VFC eligibility criteria and administration data for all VFC doses provided, VFC vaccine inventory, temperatures of refrigerators  and freezers storing or \ncontaining VFC vaccines, primary and back -up thermometer \nProvider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities  \nSection 2 \u2013 Page 5 (Rev. 01/201 4) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \ncertificate of calibration information, and routine use of the VFC \nordering system.  \nB)  Agree to be bound by the Department\u2019s terms of use for interacting with the registry and agree to be bound by any applicable federal laws, regulations or guidelines related to accessing an IDPH system and ordering publicly funded vaccines.   \nC)  In advance of any I -CARE access by my staff, representative \nor myself, I will identify each member of my staff or representative who is authorized to order vaccine on my behalf.  If changes occur, I will information the Department within 48 hours of any change in status of current staff members or representative who are no longer authorized to order v accines, or \nthe addition of any new staff authorized to order on my behalf. The term of the  Agreement is valid for one (1) year unless \nterminated earlier.   To continue participating in the program the \npractice is required to annually  re-enroll  by completing a new \nPractice Profile Form and Provider Agreement. Re- enrollment is \nnot guaranteed and may be denied for any reason. Failure to re-apply for enrollment will mean suspension and possible termination from the VFC program.  \n16. The term of the Agreement is  May to April unless terminated earlier.  \nThe Chicago Department of Public Health may terminate this agreement at any time.  If I choose to terminate the agreement, I will properly return any unused federal vaccines as directed by the Chicago Department of  \nPublic Health.   \n  \nScreening and Documenting Patient Eligibility  \nProviders have the responsibility to ensure that VFC vaccine is administered only to eligible children.  Providers  are required to maintain \na Patient Eligibility Screening Record on all VFC -eligible children. The \nscreening record is typically included in the patient paper chart  or \nElectronic Medical Record (EMR). The record can be maintained as a log if charts are not used, as in the case of mobile care vans. The \nrecords of screening must be maintained for a minimum period of three \n(3) years.  Providers are required to \nscreen all children and document \nthe results from each screening at every immunization visit. This is \nbecause insurance coverage and Medicaid eligibility may change \nbetween heal th care visits.  \n The Chicago VFC Program recommends the use of the Chicago VFC \nProgram Patient Eligibility Screening Form , although providers may \nProvider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities  \nSection 2 \u2013 Page 6 (Rev. 01/201 4) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nincor porate the information into their clinic  forms if all fields are present \nand screening is done at each im munization visit.  \n \n \nDocumenting Vaccines  \n \nUnder the law, providers must document all immunizations, including the following elements:  \n  \n\u2022 Name  of vaccine  (e.g., \u201cDTaP,\u201d not \u201cInfanrix\u201d)  \n\u2022 Vaccine m anufacturer  \n\u2022 Vaccine  lot number  \n\u2022 Date the vaccine was given \n\u2022 Signature of person administering the vaccine  \n\u2022 Publication date on  the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS)  \n\u2022 Date the VIS was given  \n\u2022 Clinic name and address where the vaccine was administered  \n\u2022 Best practices in immunization documentation would also include \nadminis tration route (IM or SQ), and site (right deltoid).   \n \nThe information must be maintained in the patient\u2019s chart or as stated \nabove for a minimum of 10 years\n1, and must be available for review by \nChicago VFC representatives. The Chicago VFC Program strongly  \nencourages the use of our Vaccine Administration Record and History  Form  (pink form) in the patient\u2019s chart  (see sample of \ncompleted form in section appendix ).  This form consolidates all the \nrequired information on a single sheet and allows for rapid ass essment \nof a child\u2019s immunization status . \nAdverse Events  \nThe National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 19862 was \npassed in response to increasing concerns regarding vaccine safety.  NCVIA established a \u201cno- fault\u201d system to compensate children and their \n1 (Inpatient and Outpatient) 210 ILCS 85/6.17 (c) M;12 years if litigation pending (IL Law on pending \nlitigation involving patient files)  \n2 Immunization and Vaccine Permanent Records \u2013  42 USC 300aa -25 M; National Childhood Vaccine Injury \nAct of 1986; record in permanent medical record.  \nProvider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities  \nSection 2 \u2013 Page 7 (Rev. 01/201 4)                                                                         CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nfamilies following adverse events associated with childhood \nimmunization.  NCVIA also established documentation standards for immunization providers and mandated the use of Vaccine Information Statements (VIS).  These standards apply to all vaccine dos es \nadministered, regardless of the funding source (public or private).   \n  \nVaccine Information Statements (VIS) \nBefore vaccinating a patient , the provider is required by \nfederal law to provide a copy of the VIS to the parent , \nlegal guardian, or patient.  \n Highlights of  legal requirements regarding the use of VISs \nare as follows:  \n\u2022 Give a copy of the most current  VIS available to the parent , legal \nguardian, or patient.  They must be given time to read the VIS \nprior to administration of the vaccine.  \n\u2022 Record the d ate the VIS was given in the patient\u2019s chart.  \n\u2022 Record the publication date of the VIS ; this date  appears at the \nbottom of the VIS.  \n\u2022 Offer th e parent , legal guardian, or patient  a copy of the VIS \nevery time , even if the child has received previous doses of th e \nsame vaccine.  \n\u2022 Chicago VFC providers are required to obtain and make copies \nof the VIS of  appropriate vaccines for their use.  \n \nThe law applies to all doses of routinely recommended childhood vaccines adm inistered by a provider, regardless of whether  VFC \nvaccine or privately purchased vaccine is used.  \n Copies of the most current VISs available at the time of publication of this manual can be found  in the RESOURCES section of this \nmanual .   They may be copied as needed.   A set  of VISs or a single \ncopy of an  individual VIS may be ordered through the CDC\u2019s \nImmuni zation Hotline at 1- 800-232-4636 .   VISs  are also available \nfor download  from the CDC\u2019s website: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ . \n Many parents/guardians speak a language other than English as their first language.

The Chicago VFC Program reserves the \nright to conduct unscheduled visits to identify probable cases of f raud \nand abuse; and take all necessary corrective actions.  \n Many providers may not be aware of instances of fraud or abuse that may be occurring in their clinic.  The following definitions  of fraud and \nabuse are derived from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) and common examples  are listed below : \n \nFraud  \nFraud is defined as \u201c an intentional deception or \nmisrepresentation made by a person with the knowledge that an unauthorized benefit could result \u2014for the entity committing the \nfraud, or some other entity.  This includes any act that constitutes \nfraud under federal or state law.\n3\u201d   \n Possible examples of the types of fraud that may occur with \nrespect to the VFC Program may include, but are not limited to:  \n \n1. A health care provider  bills Medicaid for administration \nreimbursement when no vaccines were given.  \n2. A provider  administer s VFC-supplied vaccine and then \nbills the child\u2019s private insurance company for the cost.  \n3. A provider  charges a patient for the cost of the VFC -\nsupplied vaccine.  \n4. A provider stop s purchasing vaccine for patients whose \ninsurance covers immunizations, and then uses VFC-\nsupplied vaccine for all patients, regardless of eligibility.  \n \n  \n3 See 42 Code of Federal Regulations 455.2  \nProvider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities  \nSection 2 \u2013 Page 9 (Rev. 01/201 4)                                                                         CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nAbuse  \nAbuse is defined as \u201cprovider practices that are inconsistent with \nsound fiscal, business or medical practices, and result in an unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program, or in reimbursement for services that are not medically necessary or fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care.  This would include beneficiary practices  that result in unnecessary costs to \nthe Medicaid program.\n 4\u201d \n \nPossible examples of the types of  abuse that may occur with \nrespect to the VFC Program may include, but are not limited to:  \n \n1. Vaccines are w asted, allowed to expire, or used \nimproperly.  \n2. A provider  redistributes or divert s VFC -supplied vaccine to \nother clinics or persons not expressly intended by the VFC Program.  \n3. A provider fails to screen patients for VFC eligibility  at \nevery immunization visit . \n4. A provider orders  VFC vaccine (s) in quantities or patterns \nthat do not match provider profile,  or otherwise over -order s  \nVFC vaccines . \nPreventing Fraud and Abuse  \nIn addition to complying with all VFC Program requirements, providers can take additional steps to prevent fraud and abuse in their clinic s.   \n \nStep 1:   Screen for VFC eligibility at every visit .  Providers who are \nuncertain about which patients are eligible for VFC vaccines and which vaccines can be given, should refer to the VFC Program Vaccine Eligibility Reference Table before administering va ccines.   \nStep 2 :  Compare ev ery vaccine order to the Pr actice  Profile  Form  \nbefore submitting the order to the Chicago VFC Vaccine Management Unit. Be prepared to justify to the Vaccine Manager any orders that exceed  expected usage.   \nStep 3 : Compare the nu mber of children serviced  by elig ibility \ncategory (e.g. Medicaid- enrolled children) with other \nexisting data (e.g. Medicaid billin g data)  to ensure the \n442 Code of Federal Regulations 455.2  \nProvider Enrollment, Requirements and Responsibilities  \nSection 2 \u2013 Page 10 (Rev. 01/2014 )                                                                         CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nadministration of VFC -supplied vaccine to eligible children \nonly.  \nStep 4 : Routinely  compare vaccine usag e and inventory data to \nthe VFC eligibility screening data to identify any possible \ndiscrepancies .  The Public Health Administrator I (PHA I) \nfrom the Chicago VFC Program Quality Assurance Section  \nmay review this before/during a site visit.  \nStep 5 : At a mi nimum, a VFC Practice  Profile  form should be \nupdated annually, but should be revised more frequently if a provider\u2019s clinic  size or vaccine needs change, or at the \ndiscretion of the Chicago VFC Program.\n5 \nVFC Compliance Site Visits  \nThe purpose of VFC site v isits is for t he Chicago VFC Program to \nmonitor  VFC compliance,  evaluate provider clinic s\u2019 conformance to \nprogram requirements , and provide information or answers to questions \nor concerns. Providers are required to allow VFC representatives  to \nreview the clinic \u2019s compliance with VFC requirements and assess \nimmunization coverage levels.  These visits may be informal and unscheduled or they m ay be formal and comprehensive.

A clinic\u2019s vaccine need is based upon the \nnumber of VFC eligible children seen in the clinic , as reported on the \nVFC Practice Profile Form.   Each VFC provider is expected to stock \nadequate amounts of privately purchased vaccine to use for their non-VFC eligible children in their practice. It is our goal, as it should be yours, to always have the right amount of vaccines in stock for your \npatients , both VFC and non- VFC. \n Here is a handy formula to use so that you will order the right amount of vaccine.  \n \nAmount to order = Doses Administered (previous peri od) x \nOrder \nFrequency Factor * \u2013 (subtracted from) Inventory on Hand (round all \nnumbers to the next box size).  \n \n*Order Frequency Factor  \n\u2022 2.3 (monthly orders), or  \n\u2022 1.6 (bi -monthly orders, or  \n\u2022 1.4 (quarterly orders)  \n \nExample:  \nYou order your vaccines every other month (bi -monthly) and you \nhave 30 doses of DTaP in your inventory.  You don\u2019t have any wastage and you used 22 doses during the past two months  \n \n22 x 1.6= \n35.2.  \n35.2 \u2013 30= 5.2   \nRound 5.2 up to nearest 10= Order 10 doses which is the \nright amount to order for your next ordering period.  \n \n Section  \n3 \nP \nOrdering Vaccines  \nSection 3 \u2013 Page 1 (Rev. 01/2012)  CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HAND BOOK  \n \n \nPurpose \nThis is a detailed guide to help new I -CARE users with managing their vaccine \ninventory in I -CARE.

Single doses of vaccine accidentally wasted for \nany reason do not need to be returned, but should be recorded on your Chicago VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order \nand Accountability Form . \n Complete a Vaccine Return Form , each time vaccine is \nreturned to the McKesson, the distributor , indicating the \nreason for the return of the vaccine.  A copy of the Vaccine \nReturn Form  is contained at the end of this section.   \nProviders should return ONLY EXPIRED OR SPOILED VACCINE.  \n   \n \nStep 4:  Doses Administered by Year or Age  \nAll VFC practices should use  the VFC Vaccine Usage  \nWorksheet/ Tally Sheet  to track vaccine s administered  by \nage and type.  Your accurate count of vaccines \nadministered helps develop your profile and justifies the \namounts of vaccine you order.  Each staff person who \nadministered VFC vaccine must be instructed to add a \n\u201ctally \u201d mark each time vaccine is removed from the vaccine \nrefrigerator . Carefully record the brand of vaccine and the \nages of the patients vaccinated.  At the end of the reporting \nperiod, the primary person responsible should transfer the tally numbers, using whole numbers only (i.e., 2, 45, 86) , \nonto the Chicago VFC Pediatric  Vaccine Order and \nAccountability Form . If a particular vaccine was not used \nduring the reporting period, write a \u201c0\u201d in that space.   \n If your EMR system can accurately capture doses administered by age and vaccine, you may use this alternate method for y our doses administered, but only \nafter you have verified the accuracy of these reports by comparing it with your manually tracked Doses Administered Tally Sheet.  \n Step 5:  Doses Requested  \nRecord the num ber of vaccine doses requested.

Therefore, they need to be \nmanaged as carefully  as possible to avoid unnecessary loss.  It is the \nresponsibility of participating providers to ensure that vaccine is managed in such \na way that will minimize loss through wastage or spoilage. Following the procedures outlined below will ensure proper vaccine management.   \n \nWritten Plan s for Vaccine Management, Staff Training and \nTemperature Monitoring  \nProviders are required to develop their own written  plans for the following : \n\u2022 Routine  Vaccine Storage and Handling  \n\u2022 Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling  \n\u2022 Temperature Monitoring Procedures  \n\u2022 New Staff Training with topics and log  of those trained with dates  \n \n\u2022 Providers  may customiz e the Chicago VFC Program supplied \ntemplat es/sample plan s for three of the above requirements (included at the \nend of this section). Both the routine and the emergency plans should be simple, and the processes outlined in the plan should be presented in a clear and concise manner. Both plans should be reviewed annually and updated as \nnecessary  when staff or situations change.  Copies of all plans should be made \navailable to VFC Program staff upon request.   \n \nRoutine Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan  \nThis plan should include guidance on the following aspects of routine vaccine \nmanagement:  \n1. designating a primary vaccine coordinator and at least one back -up staff;  \n2. ordering vaccines;  \n3. controlling inventory;  \n4. storing vaccines, monitoring storage conditions, and vaccine handling   Section  \n4 \nV \nVaccine Management  \nSection 4 \u2013 Page 1 (Rev. 01/2014 ) \n CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \n5. minimizing vaccine wastage; and  \n6. vaccine shipping, including receiving, packing , and transporting vaccine in \nemergency situations  only. \nEmergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan  \nThis plan should include guidance on what to do in the event  of refrigerator or freezer \nmalfunctions, power failures, natural disasters, or other emergencies that might \ncompromise appropriate vaccine storage conditions . The emergency plan should \ninclude the following:  \n1. person(s) responsible for preparing and transp orting vaccine, including \ncontact information;   \n2. how this person will be notified that vaccine needs to be moved;   \n3. location that will receive vaccine;   \n4. how receiving location will be notified of transport ;  \n5. how to pack vaccine for transport ; and   \n6. worksheet to document vaccine involved in power or equipment failure.   \n \nAt a minimum the emergency plan must be reviewed and updated annually or when there is a change in staff who have \nresponsibilities specified in the emergency plan.  \n \nTemperat ure Monitoring Plan \nProviders need to have an established protocol for reviewing and recording \ntemperature readings twice daily. They may customize the Routine Temperature \nMonitoring Guidelines (included at the end of this section) to meet this \nrequirement.  Temperature moni toring is the primary responsibility of the \nvaccine coordinator and back -up coordinator.  In the Routine Temperature \nMonitoring Plan, providers are required to have written procedures to train staff who u se \nVFC vaccine.  Designated staff must:  \n\u2022 Review temp eratures within each vaccine storage unit two (2) times each day \n(beginning and end);   \n\u2022 Document any actions that are taken if the temperature readings are out of \nacceptable range;   \n\u2022 Staff must also be trained to respond to unacceptable temperatures with a clearly \ndefined set of action steps.   \nVaccine Management  \nSection 4 \u2013 Page 2 (Rev. 01/2014 ) \n CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nAs always, all VFC paperwork, including temperatures logs, staff training logs, routine \nand emergency plans must be kept and available for review for three (3) years . \n If the clinic  is open less than for 5 days each week, the provider must use a digital data \nlogger to assure that temperatures were maintained properly during the days the clinic was closed. If the clinic will be closed for vacation, the vaccine coordinator (or back -up) \nshould be assigned to check the vaccine storage appliance(s) one or two days over the holiday or have a refrigerator monitoring device installed that is programmed to call a responsible party in the event of a problem.  \nProviders can choose to monitor temperatures using Fahrenheit ( \u00b0F) or Celsius (\u00b0C) \nscales. The readings should be done consistently in one scale for all readings in all \nstorage units used by the clinic/facility . \n \nThe vaccine coordinator should record the exact time of each reading, the room  \ntemperature, staff initials, and m inimum and maximum temperatures since the last \nreading. After taking readings, minimum/maximum temperatures should be reset.  If the \nclinic is closed on certain days, temperatures do not need to be recorded and should be marked \u201cclosed.\u201d  \n  \nVaccine Management  \nSection 4 \u2013 Page 3 (Rev. 01/2014 ) \n CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nPost a temperat ure log on the vaccine storage unit door nearby in a readily accessible \nplace.

Training must include:  \n1. Elements of routine and emergency vaccine management  \n2. The vaccine cold chain  \n3. Appropriate procedures for receiving vaccines  \n4. Vaccine and thermometer placement  \n5. Temperature monitor ing and documentation  \n6. Responding to temperatures that are out -of-range  \n7. Procedures for preventing, reporting and returning \nexpired/wasted/spoiled vaccines  \nThe primary vaccine coordinator should r eview temperature logs \nweekly if daily monitoring is being conducted by a back -up person to \nensure proper temperature recording.

Proper vaccine storage practices are important to ensure that every dose of vaccine given to a child is reliable and effective.  It also reduces the amount of vaccine that is expired or wasted due to improper storage.  \nLocation and Placement  \n1. Store vaccines that require refrigeration in the middle of the refrigerator compartment away from the coils, walls, floor, and cold air vent.  \n2. Store vaccines that require freezer storage in the middle of the freezer compartment, away from the walls, coils, floor and sides.  \n3. Store vaccine to allow for cold air circulation around the vaccine.  \n4. Do not store vaccine in doors of the stora ge unit.  \nCDC requires that all stored VFC vaccines must be kept separate from any other type of vaccines (private purchase, S -CHIP or 317).  \n Unless \notherwise \nnoted, the \nvaccine \ncoordinator \nand/or backup \nshould be the \nVFC contact \nperson for the \nclinic.  \nVaccine Management  \nSection 4 \u2013 Page 14 (Rev. 01/20 14) \n CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \n                            \n  \nLabeling  \n1. Keep vaccines organized. Store vaccines products that have similar packag ing in \ndifferent locations to avoid confusion and vaccine administration error s.   \n \n         \n2. Open only one vial, or box, of a particular vaccine at a time to control vaccine \nusage and allow easier inventory.   Use all the vaccine in one multi -dose vial \nbefore opening another one.  \n3. Diluents should be clearly labeled, whether they are stored at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Label the boxes of corresponding vaccines and diluents \nfrom the same manufacturer so that they will be used together.   Diluent s are not \ninterchangeable.  Staff should assure that they are using the proper diluent with the chosen vaccine.  \nStorage Containers  \nAttach labels directly to shelves or label trays according to \nthe vaccines they contain.  Note:  \nDiluents may be stored in refrigerator door.  Vaccines should not be stored in refrigerat or \ndoor\n Vaccines \nshould be stored in the middle of the compartment, away from the vents, walls, coils and off \nthe floor.  \n \nVaccine Management  \nSection 4 \u2013 Page 15 (Rev. 01/20 14) \n CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \n1. To avoid confusion, vaccine boxes should be stored together by type and \narranged in rows.  \n2. Boxes should be stacked according t o expiration dates. Vaccines with the \nshortest expiration dates should be closer to the front of the storage unit compartment for easy access.  \n3. Store all open and unopened vials of vaccines in their boxes inside the appropriate storage unit so that their c ontents and expiration dates are easily \nvisible.  \n4. Use t rays and containers to organize vaccine boxes. Each tray or container \nshould  only store vaccine of the same type.  \nNon-Vaccine Products  \n1. Never store food or beverages in the refrigerator or freezer where vaccines are \nstored.  Frequent opening and closing of the refrigerator or freezer door can lead to marked temperature variations and decrease vaccine efficacy.  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \nUse a Reliable Refrigerator and Freezer  \nVaccine storage units must be selected careful ly and used properly.   Refrigerators or \nstand- alone freezers  used for vaccine storage must comply with the following \nrequirements:  \n \n1. Be able to maintain required vaccine storage temperatures year -round;  \n2. Be large enough to hold the year's largest inventory  (e.g. influenza season);  \n3. Have a working, certified thermometer stored in both stand- alone freezer  and \nrefrigerator.  \n4. Be dedicated to the storage of vaccines. (Food and beverages must not be \nstored in a vaccine storage unit because this practice results in frequent opening \nof the door and destabilization of the temperature.)  \n5. Appliance should be equipped with automatic defrost capabilities.   Manual \ndefrost appliances will only be approved if there is another location in which vaccines can be safely stored while defrosting is taking place.  Providers are \nVaccine Management  \nSection 4 \u2013 Page 16 (Rev. 01/20 14) \n CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \ncautioned that any amount of frost build- up over 1- 2 cm will require immediate \ndefrosting.  \n \nThree  types of storage units are acceptable:  \n1. A refrigerator that has a separate freezer compartment  with a separate exterior \ndoor (Note: only refrigerator compartment may be used for VFC vaccine \nstorage) . \n2. Stand -alone refrigerator  \n3. Stand -alone freezer  \n \nSmall single -door (dormitory -style or bar -style) combined refrigerator -freezer units  \nshould not be used for permanent vac cine storage. The freezer compartment in this \ntype of unit is  incapable of maintaining temperatures cold enough to store MMRV, \nvaricella, and zoster  vaccines. If attempts are made to cool the freezer compartment to \nthe appropriate temperature, the temperat ure in the refrigerator compartment will fall \nbelow the recommended  range, potentially freezing the refrigerated vaccines.  \n \n \n                                                                  Not Suitable Unit  \n      \n \n \n   \n \n \n     Refrigerator and freezer compartments  \n   must have separate external doors.  \n \n \nPrepare Vaccine Storage Units  \nBefore any VFC vaccine can be stored in a vaccine storage unit, the temperature must \nbe set and stabilized to the appropriate temperature ranges.  \nRefrigerator  \nThe refrigerat or compartment should maintain temperatures between 35\u00b0 and \n46\u00b0F  (2\u00b0 and 8\u00b0C). The temperature should never fall below 35\u00b0F (2\u00b0C) or rise \nabove 46\u00b0F  (8\u00b0C). Therefore, set the temperature mid- range to achieve an \naverage of about 40\u00b0F (5\u00b0C).  This temperature setting will provide the best safety \nmargin.  \nSingle -door \nrefrigerators with \nenclosed fr eezers \nare not  acceptable \nfor the storage of \nVFC vaccine.  \n \nVaccine Management  \nSection 4 \u2013 Page 17 (Rev. 01/20 14) \n CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \n \nFreezer  \nThe freezer should maintain an average temperature of 5\u00b0F ( -15\u00b0C) or colder.  \n \n \n \n \nSteps to Stabilize  Temperatures  \n1. Remove all vegetable/storage bins from the refrigerator compartment.  \n2. Place at least two or three large containers of water at the bottom of the \nrefrigerator.  \n3. Store the water bottles against the inside walls and in the door  racks of the \nrefrigerator.  \n4. Store frozen ice packs along the walls, back, and bottom of the stand -\nalone freezer and insid e the racks of the freezer door.  \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n      \n     \nNot only will water bottles and frozen packs help maintain an even \ntemperature in the compartments with frequent opening and closing of the \ndoors, they will also help keep the temperatures stable in the event of a power  failure.    \n Allow 30 days of twice daily refrigerator and freezer \ntemperature recordings before using a newly installed \nor newly repaired refrigeration unit to store vaccines.  \nFrozen \npacks in \nfreezer  Frozen  \npacks in \nfreezer  \nWater bottles \nin refrigerator  In case of an emergency \nthat causes the vaccines \nto have to be moved, the \nice packs will be needed \nimmediately to keep the \nvaccine cold inside the \ncooler(s).  \n \nVaccine Management  \nSection 4 \u2013 Page 18 (Rev. 01/20 14) \n CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nVaccine Security and Equipment Maintenance  \nIt is important to routinely monitor that the vaccine storage unit is working properly in \norder to protect the vaccine supply.  If the vaccine storage unit is not working properly,  \nproviders should refer to their clinic\u2019s emergency vaccine storage and handling plan and try to identify the cause of the problem. Below are a few basic ways  to maintain the \nproper functioning of vaccine storage units and protect vaccines.  \n1. Do not use outl ets with built -in circuit switches (they have little reset buttons) for \nrefrigerator/ freezers.   \n2. Avoid wall outlets that can be activated by a wall switch.  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n3. Use a safety -lock plug or an outlet cover to reduce the chance of the unit \nbecoming inadvertently unplugged.  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nVaccine Management  \nSection 4 \u2013 Page 19 (Rev. 01/20 14) \n CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \n \n4. Post a \u201cDo Not Unplug\u201d or \u201cWarning\u201d sign next to the outlet and on the electrical \npanel to warn people not to unplug or disconnect the refrigerator/freezers.  A copy \nof the sign is available at the end of this section.  \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n5. Limit access to the vaccine supply to authorized personnel only.  \n6. Check that doors are properly sealed each time the door they are closed.  \n7. Providers with a large quantity of VFC vaccines should use a back -up generator \nin case of a major power failure.  \nUse Certified Thermometers  \nAll refrigerator and freezer units that are used to store VFC vaccine must be equipped \nwith a certified and calibrated thermometer with a current certificate of calibration at all \ntimes. The Centers for Disease Control  requires  use of a certified, calibrated \nthermometer and a back -up thermometer in each storage unit used to store VFC \nvaccine.  CDC requires that all temperature devices have probes in glycol  rather than \nthermometers that measure air temperatures.  \n Follow  the manuf acturer\u2019s recommended schedule for recalibration of the certified \nthermometers.   Be sure that clinic  staff understands how to r ead the thermometer (s) \nused in the storage units.   \n Acceptable certified thermometers include the following:  \n \nDigital Thermometer s \nDigital thermometers have an easy -to-read screen o n which the \ntemperature is displayed in Fahrenheit and/or  Celsius. Some have \noptional features, including a display of the minimum and maximum  \ntemperatures, a temperature alarm that can be set to ring at  a \nspecified temperature, and a temperature probe in glycol \n \nVaccine Management  \nSection 4 \u2013 Page 20 (Rev. 01/20 14) \n CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nDigital Data Loggers  \nDigital data loggers are small, \nbattery -operated, electronic \ndevices that may be \nprogrammed to record  \ntemperatures at intervals throughout the day.  They  are \ncapable of recor ding hundreds \nor even thousands of individual temperature readings.  Digital \ndata loggers used in vaccine storage are accompanied by special software that is  installed \nin a computer. In order to review the temperature history, the user must download data from the  digital data logger to \nthe computer on a regular basis. When digital data \nloggers are used in vaccine \nstorage, temperatures must still be manually checked and recorded twice a day. A second certified thermometer may be used for these manual temperat ure \nchecks.   The CDC and Chicago VFC strongly recommend using digital data \nloggers for continuous temperature monitoring in vaccine storage units. Even though it is only a recommendation at this time, Chicago VFC anticipates that all VFC providers will soon be required to have digital data loggers.  \n  \nThe data will help to identify if storage temperatures are in proper range. The \ndata includes important information such as minimum and maximum temperatures, alarms, and length of time that vaccines may have been stored in out of range temperatures.   \n  \nInformation technology support technicians  (IT/IS)  may be needed to assist with \nthis process.   Installation and training takes about 1- 1\u00bd hours.  \n With a data logger\u2019s continuous temperature monitoring, you will always know if proper storage conditions were maintained overnight and through weekends and holidays.  By providing your practice and Chicago VFC detailed temperature excursion measurements, data loggers can prevent unnecessary vaccine loss.\nVaccine Management  \nSection 4 \u2013 Page 21 (Rev. 01/20 14) \n  \nThe CDC recomm ends digital data loggers used for VFC vaccines should have \nthe following features:  \n\uf0fc Temperature measured by a probe in glycol bottle  \n\uf0fc High/low alarm for out -of-range temperatures  \n\uf0fc Current temperature display, as well as minimum and maximum    \ntemperatures  \n\uf0fc Reset button  \n\uf0fc Low battery indicator  \n\uf0fc Calibrated with accuracy of +/ - 1\u00b0F (0.5\u00b0C)  \n\uf0fc Memory storage of at least 4000 readings. The device will not rewrite \nover old data and stops recording when memory is full.  \n\uf0fc User programmable logging interval (or reading rate). Chicago VFC suggests recording in fifteen minute intervals\n. \n \n  The following are suggested websites where certified thermometers can be purchased:  \n\u2022 https://www1.fishersci.com/Coupon?cid=1328&gid=203749\n&details=Y  \n\u2022 http://www.control3.com/4048p.htm  \n\u2022 http://www. weberscientific.com/  \n\u2022 http://www.control3.com/4127p.htm  \n\u2022 http://www.technika.com/navpage/min.htm  \n\u2022 http://www.dick sonweb.com/product s/find/temperature/data-\nlogger  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \nProper Thermometer Placement  \nThe thermometer should be placed in the center of the \ncompart ment with the stored vaccine and away  from the coils,  \nwalls, floor, and fan in order to obtain a true reading of the temperatures. Be sure that air can circulate around them.  \n \nRefrigerator  \n \nIn the refrigerator,  thermometers should be positioned away from the fan and \nnot too close to the freezer.  It  should be placed on the middle shelf, adjacent \nto the vaccine, or hanging down from the upper shelf.  \nFreezer  \nIn the freezer, the thermometer should be suspended from the ceiling of  the \ncompartment or placed on a box ( or some other item ) so that it is in the middle \nof the  compartment , off the floor. If the thermometer indicates a temperature \noutside the recommended range, check that the thermometer is appropriately \nsituated.      \nReceipt of Vaccine Shipments  \nAll staff members who accept vaccine deliveries must be aware of the importance of \nmaintaining the cold chain and of the need to immediately notify the vaccine coordinator or backup person of the arrival of the vaccine shipment so that it can be handled and st ored appropriately .   \n Steps to properly inspect and store vaccine shipments are listed below:  \n \n1. Designate one staff member (and a back -up staff member) to receive vaccine \nshipments.  Ideally, these staff members would be the VFC Vaccine Coordinator Place a \nthermometer in \nthe center of \neach refr igerator \nand freezer unit.  \n \n  \nand VFC Back -up Vaccine Coordinator,  but anyone who would receive vaccine \nshipments should be trained thoroughly in this process.  \n2. Upon delivery, open the shipping box immediately  and inspect the contents for \nany potential damage that may have occurred during shipm ent. Ensure the box is \nnot left idle and  that vaccines are promptly and properly stored by you or by the \nappropriate designated staff member.   \n3. Allow sufficient time to properly unpack the vaccine, review the shipping invoice \nand inspect the shipment.  \n4. Inspect the shipment:  \na. Check the vaccine and diluent quantities against the vaccine order invoice to make sure they match.  Diluent is  shipped with MMR and varicella.  \nb. Check the vaccine lot numbers and expiration dates to make sure no expired or short -dated vacc ines/diluents are in the shipment.  \nc. Report any order discrepancies immediately to the Chicago VFC Program Vaccine Management Unit at 312.746.5385  \n5. Inspect the vaccine:  \na. Check the temperature indicator that is enclosed in the shipment container to determine if  the vaccines were exposed to temperatures outside of the \nproper range for storage and handling while en route to the clinic.   \nb. Make sure that:  \n\uf06f Inactivated vaccines are cold , but not frozen.  Refrigerated \npacks should still be cold.  \n\uf06f Vaccine is not in direc t contact with frozen packs (e.g. \ncrumpled br own packing paper or bubble wrap between the \nvaccines and the frozen packs) .  \n\uf06f Measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine is cold OR \nfrozen.  \n\uf06f MMRV, varicella, and zoster vaccines are frozen and that gel packs are present in the shipping container.  \n\uf06f Diluent is cool or at room temperature.  \n\uf06f Diluent should not be in direct contact with refrigerated/frozen packs (e.g. crumpled brown packing paper  or bubble wrap \nbetween the diluents and frozen packs) .  \n\uf06f The diluent for varicella vaccine will be shipped with its \nvaccine but will be located in a separate compartment on the top of the shipping container . \n6. Immediately notify the McKesson  Specialty Contact Center (MSCC)  at 1-877-\nTEMP123 (1 -877-836-7123)  if there is any possibility o f improper storage and \nhandling during transportation  within two (2) hours of receiving the shipment .  \nThis REMEMBER:  \nLive \nvaccines are \nsensitive to \nheat and \nlight . \n \nInactivated \nvaccines are \nsensitive to \nfreezing.  \n \n \n  \nphone number also appears on the temperature monitors included in the vaccine \nshipments .  Any calls received by MSCC after day of delivery will result in CDC \nliability for vaccine replacement regardless of the cause of the temperature excursion.  \n7. After inspecting the shipment, place vaccines in proper storage immediately upon receipt.   \na. Varicella and MMR -V vaccine should go immediately in the freezer and all \nother vaccines in the refrigerator.  \nb. Diluent can be stored in the refrigerator or at room temperature, but it must not be frozen.   \nVaccine Type  Proper Temperature \nRange  \nRefrigerated Vaccines  \n35\u00b0 - 46\u00b0 F (2\u00b0 -  8\u00b0 C)  \n \nTarget: 40\u00b0F (\u00b0C)  \n \n \u2022   DTaP -HepB -IPV  \n\u2022   DTap- IPV-HIB   \n\u2022   DTaP  \n\u2022   DT \n\u2022   Hepatitis A  \n\u2022   Hepatitis B  \n\u2022   HIB vaccines  \n\u2022   Hib-HepB  \n\u2022   HPV  \n\u2022   Inactivated Flu vaccine  \n\u2022   IPOL  \u2022 Live Attenuated Flu \nVaccine (Flumist)  \n\u2022 MCV4  \n\u2022 MMR  \n\u2022 PCV13  \n\u2022 PPSV23 \n\u2022 Rotavirus  \n\u2022 Tdap \n\u2022 Td \n \nFrozen Vaccines  5\u00b0 F ( -15\u00b0 C) or \ncolder  \n \u2022   MMR* \n\u2022   MMRV  \n\u2022   Varicella  \n* MMR vaccine remains viable if frozen, but is usually stored in the refrigerator.  \n \n8. If there are any discrepancies in the amounts of vaccines \nshipped or missing product in the shipment or concerns about the shipment, place vaccine in a proper storage unit, \nbut apart from other vaccines.  \n      Immediately contact the Chicago VFC Program V accine \nManagement Unit  at 312.746.5385.  \n       \n  A copy of Vaccine Handling Tips  and an overview of the Vaccine Storage and \nHandling Toolkit , whic h can be found on the CDC website,  are contained at the \nend of this section.  The CDC advises providers to consult the vaccine package \ninserts for more detailed information on vaccine storage and handling . \n \n  \nOther Vaccine Handling Tips  \n\u2022 Use only the diluents s upplied when reconstituting MMR  and varicella.  \n\u2022 Once MMR and varicella are  reconstituted, they must be kept cold and \nprotected from light.  \nNote: Varicella and combination MMR -V must be kept frozen  \n\u2022 Discard reconstituted MMR if not used within eight (8) hours . \n\u2022 Discard varicella containing vaccines  (Varicella, MMRV) if not used within thirty \n(30) minutes.  \n\u2022 Discard rotavirus vaccine residue in biohazard container.  \nReturning Shipment Boxes  \nEmpty shipment containers should be discarded/recycled appropriately. Do not \nattempt to returned empty shipment containers . to the vaccine manufacturer .  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPreventing Vaccine Loss  \nVaccine loss can occur due to the following errors:  \n1. Spoilage  \u2013 vaccine damaged due to improper storage conditions  or cold chain \nfailure  \n2. Expirati on \u2013 vaccine not administered prior to expiration date  \n3. Wastage \u2013 vaccine that could not be administered once removed from storage \n(e.g. parent refused vaccine after the dose was drawn up, varicella vaccine could \nnot be administered within 30 minutes of rec onstitution , or vaccine vials/syringes \nwere are damaged/broken and could not be administered).  \nTo prevent vaccine loss, the Chicago VFC Program strongly recommends the \nfollowing practices in all providers \u2019 offices.  \n Providers  should \nkeep  enough \nboxes  and \nsupplies to \ntransport entire \ninventory in the \nevent of an \nemergency.  \n \n  \nMaintain the Cold Chain  to Prevent Spoi lage \n\u2022 Properly store all vaccine as described above.  \n\u2022 Maintain the cold chain from receipt of shipment to placement in the \nappropriate vaccine storage units.  \n\u2022 If cold chain failure occurs due to equipment breakdown, providers \nshould transport the vaccines to an appropriate vaccine storage unit as \nsoon as possible and according to their clinic\u2019s Emergency Handling \nPlan.  \n \n \n \nRotate Vaccine to Prevent Expiration  \n\u2022 Check expiration dates regularly.  Depending upon the clinic \nvolume, this may need to be done daily or weekly.  \n\u2022 Rotate vaccine stock by placing vaccines with shorter expiration dates in front of those with longer expiration dates . \n\u2022 Use shortest -dated vaccine first.  \n\u2022 When new vaccines arrive, be sure to rotate stock.  The vaccines with the longest expiration dates belong in the back of the refrigerator or freezer. Remember the latest received shipment could possibly have the shortest expiration dates . \n\u2022 Order the Right Amount of Vaccines.  Use the formula provided in Section 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVaccinate within Time to Pr event Waste  \n\u2022 Carefully screen all patients for contraindications and precautions for each \nscheduled immunization.  Providers s hould NEVER redistribute or transpor t \nVFC vaccines to USE in another practice or other \noutside location.  \n \nWhen providers  identify vaccines that will expire \nwithin three (3) months and do not plan to use it all, \nfax the Vaccine Management Unit at 312.746. 6220 \nso arrangements can try to be made to find another \nprovider who can use the vaccine prior to its \nexpiration.  Please include vaccine name, quantity, \nand expiration date on this fax, along with your \nname, clinic, PIN #, and phone number.  \n \n  \n\u2022 Verify that parents/legal guardians/patients understand and consent to all \nimmunizations to be given.  \n\u2022 Once reconstituted, vaccines must be admi nistered within the time \nguidelines provided by the manufacturer or discarded.  \n\u2022 Do not pre- draw vaccines into syringes.  Pre -drawing vaccine \ncan cause administration errors and vaccine waste.  Refer to Section 6:  Vaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules for more information.\n \nReporting Vaccine Loss   \nAs participants of the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, all VFC providers are \nrequired to report the amount of vaccine in invent ory that is expired, spoiled , or \nwasted on the Vaccine Return Form . Once reported, ALL unopened vaccine vials  \nand syringes  that have expired or spoiled  are to be returned in their original \npackaging  to the McKesson Specialty Distribution Center. A federal excise tax is \nissued from vaccine manufactures for all expired and spo iled vaccines.  \nNOTE: Privately purchased vaccines should NOT  be reported to the VFC Program.  \nSpoilage  \nSpoiled vaccines are identified as products that were improperly stored, \naffected by an  office power failure, affected by a failure of the appliance in \nwhich the vaccines were stored, or vaccine that was spoiled during shipment \n(ex. frozen, or too warm).  \n \nWhat to do if you have SPOILED vaccine:  \n1. DO NOT discard any spoiled vaccine. Please keep these vaccines \nrefrigerated (or frozen if for MMRV or Varicella),  and then,  \n2. Call the Chicago VFC Vaccine Management Unit immediately at 312.746.5385 for instructions on how to proceed. Depending upon the manufacturer\u2019s specifications, there is a possibility that the compromised  \nvaccines are not spoiled.  \nNOTE: Providers should NOT assume that a temperature excursion outside of \nthe recommended range will automatically cause vaccines to spoil.   You \nmust contact the VFC program.  Only the VFC management can determine that vaccine is affected. \n3. If you are informed by the Chicago VFC Vaccine Management Unit that the vaccine is deemed spoiled, you may then remove it from the \n \n  \nrefrigerator/freezer, place them in the green Expired Vaccine bag supplied \nby VFC labeled.  \n4. Document all spoiled vaccine on the Vaccine Return Form . \n5. Document  the number of doses of  spoiled vaccines in the appropriate \nspaces on the Chicago VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order and Accountability \nForm. You will be asked to provide a corrective action plan regarding how \nto prevent the spoilage f rom occurring in the future.  Please fax this \ncorrective action plan to the Vaccine Management Unit at 312. 746.6220.  \nExpiration  \nExpired vaccines are identified as products that have exceeded the printed \nexpiration date found on the box or on the vial/syringe.  \nWhat to do if you have EXPIRED  vaccine:  \n \n1. DO NOT  discard expired vaccines.  \n2. Remove expired vaccine from the refrigerator/freezer, place in the green \nExpired Vaccine bag supplied  by VFC .   \nNOTE: Expired vaccines should be kept together in original boxes. Unused  \nloose vials  or syringe s should be grouped with the boxes of the same \nvaccine. Expired multi -dose vials from which some doses were removed  \nshould be discarded by the provider in an appropriate biohazard disposal container.  \n3. Document all expired vaccines on the Vaccine Return Form . \n4. Document the number of expired vaccine doses i n the appropriate spaces \non the Chicago VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order and Accountability Form.  \nWastage  \nWasted vaccines are described as the following:  \n\u2022 Used syringes, with and without needles  \n\u2022 Broken vials  \n\u2022 A syri nge that was drawn up but not used  \n\u2022 Any multi -dose vials from which some doses were removed (including IPV \nand influenza vaccine)  \n\u2022 Diluent  \n\u2022 Private ly Purchased Vaccine:  Do NOT return any privately purchased \nvaccine.  \n \n  \nWhat to do if you have WASTED vaccine:  \n \n1. Wasted vaccines are NOT returnable.  \n2. Individual doses of w asted vaccines should be discarded  \nby the provider using an appropriate biohazard disposal \ncontainer at the practice/clinic.  \n3. Document all expired vaccines on the Vaccine Return \nForm . \n4. Document the numbe r of wasted vaccine doses on the \nappropriate spaces on the Chicago VFC Pediatric Vaccine Order and Accountability Form.   \nReturning Expired and Spoiled Vaccine  \nThe Chicago Department of Health VFC Program has outlined the following steps that providers should take to return all expired and spoiled vaccines to the McKesson Specialty Distribution Center:  \n Step 1 : Notify the Chicago VFC Vaccine Management Unit of spoiled/expired \nvaccines by completing and faxing a copy of the Chicago VFC Vaccine Return Form  \nto the Vaccine Management Unit at 312.746.6220.  \n Step 2 : Consolidate all expired/spoiled vaccines into a shipment b ox(s). The shipment \nbox(s) should NOT be packed with cold gel packs or thermometers.  \n \nStep 3 : Sign the Vaccine Return Form  for accuracy.  Place a copy of the Vaccine \nReturn Form  in the shipment box(s) so that it is visible.  \n \nNOTE: A  copy of the form must be maintained at the provider office for three years \nfollowing submission.  \n Step 4 : The provider will receive pre- paid vaccine return shipment l abels via U .S. \nPostal Service  Mail within two weeks of submitting the Vaccine Return Form . \n NOTE : If the pre -paid return shipment labels have not been received within two \nweeks, please contact the Vaccine Management Unit at 312.746. 5385 . \n Step 5 : Once pre-paid vaccine return shipment labels have be received, place one \nlabel  on the outside of each shipment box  in a visible location.  \n Step 6 : If the provider is on a UPS pick up route, hold all shipment box(s) for the next \nUPS pick up, or bring  all shipment box(s) to the nearest UPS store.   \n \n  \nReturn Shipment Specifications  \n\u2022 The provider must complete the Vaccine Return Form  for all expired or \nspoiled vaccine within their designated order period. (Ex. Bi -monthly \nproviders would submit a vaccine return form every tw o months if  any \nvaccine was expired, spoiled, or wasted within a two month period.)  \n\u2022 All returns must be shipped in a suitable cardboard box that is in good \ncondition, free of punctures and clean.  \n\u2022 The weight of the shipment box(s) should be such that it does not break \nopen during shipment as a result of excessive weight.  \n\u2022 The shipment box(s) should be sealed appropriately such that the returned \nvaccine is not exposed or risks being damaged during shipment.  \n\u2022 The provider must e nsure that all old labeling ( ex. refrigerate upon receipt, \nbiohazard, keep frozen etc.) on re- used shipment box(s) is crossed out \nand/or removed with prior to shipment.  \n \nFor information on the Centers for Disease Control Vaccine Storage and \nHandling Toolkit , visit:  \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/vacc ines/recs/storage/toolkit/default.htm  \n \n    \n     \n \n  \nSection 4 Appendix  \n\u2022 Vaccine Return Form  \n\u2022 Sample View of Prepaid Return Shipment Labels  \n\u2022 Refrigerator labels (English)  \n\u2022 Refrigerator labels (Spanish)  \n\u2022 Manufacturer Quality Control Office Telephone Numbers  \n\u2022 Routine and Emergency Vaccine Handling Plan Template  \n\u2022 Routine Temperature Monitoring Guideline (Manual)  \n\u2022 Routine Temperature Monitoring Guideline (Electronic)  \n\u2022 Recording Freezer Temperatures -  Celsius ( \u00b0C) \n\u2022 Recording Refrigerator Temperatures -  Celsius ( \u00b0C) \n\u2022 Vaccine Tem perature Log  (Refrigerator) - Celsius ( \u00b0C)  \n\u2022 Vaccine Temperature Log  (Freezer) - Celsius ( \u00b0C)  \n\u2022 Recording Freezer Temperatures -  Fahrenheit (\u00b0F)  \n\u2022 Recording Refrigerator Temperatures -  Fahrenheit (\u00b0F)  \n\u2022 Vaccine Temperature Log  (Refrigerator) - Fahrenheit (\u00b0F)  \n \n\u2022 Vaccine Temperature Log  (Freezer) - Fahrenheit (\u00b0F)  \n \n\u2022 Sample Completed Temperature Log  \n\u2022 Vaccine Storage Troubleshooting Record  \n\u2022 Don\u2019t Be Guilty of These Errors in Vaccine Storage and Handling  \n\u2022 Vaccine Handling Tips  \n\u2022 Vaccine  Storage and Handling Toolkit  Overview  \n \n \n Quality Assurance and \nQuality Improvement  \nuality assurance (QA) and quality improvement (QI) activities are \nused to improve VFC program compliance, immunization \ncoverage and clinical practices.  Each VFC Provider is assigned \na Public Health Adm inistrator I (PHA I) from the VFC Program Quality \nAssurance Section and a Public Health Administrator II (PHA II) from \nthe VFC Program Quality Improvement Section. The PHA I from the \nQuality Assurance Section will review and provide techni cal assistance \nto meet the VFC c ompliance requirements.  The PHA II from the Quality \nImprovement Section will provide immunization resources, guidance on \nbest practices and conduct chart assessments  to improve immunization \npractices .   \n According to law, providers may discl ose patient health records to \nhealth officials with in the VFC Program without patient permission.  For \nadditional guidance, see the HIPAA Factsheet contained at the end of this section.  Information obtained from patient records will be kept confidential.  \n  \nQuality Assurance (VFC Site Visit)  \nQuality Assurance (QA ) involves review and evaluation of \nVFC provider practices  and is a legal requirement of the \nVFC program .  A PHA I from the VFC Program Quality \nAssurance Section will conduct  at least two types of \nquality assurance visits throughout the year: 1) routine \nvisits and 2) compre hensive quality assurance reviews .  The purpose of \nboth types of visits are to monitor compliance with VFC Program \nrequirements and to determine if VFC vaccines are being distributed, handled, and given to patients according to VFC policies . \n Section  \n5 \nQ \n Routine visits  are informal and generally brief .  The PHA I from the \nQuality Assurance Section is  required to check the vaccine storage \nunit(s) at every visit , review  temperature logs and may  check other \nareas of program compliance.  The quality  assurance staff may also \nshare updated VFC inf ormation, drop off VFC Program forms , provide \ntraining and answer questions related to VFC.  \n \nEvery year  each VFC provider is required to have a comprehensiv e \nquality  assurance  review (QAR) .  This type o f visit requires a thorough \nevaluation of the provider\u2019s compliance with all VFC program \nrequirements including:  \n\u2022 Verification of  information in the provider profile;  \n\u2022 Review of VFC eligibility screening and doc umenting procedures;  \n\u2022 Review of vaccine storage and handling  practices (including \ntemperature logs and vaccine storage units);  \n\u2022 Evaluation of provider\u2019s written procedures related to temperature monitoring , routine vaccine storage and handling  and emergency \nvaccine storage and handling ; \n\u2022 Review of documentation of VIS given;  \n\u2022 Review of documentation for vaccine administration;  \n\u2022 Review of vaccine ordering and accountability ; \n\u2022 Verification that VFC P rogram policies  are being properly \nimplemented.  \n If pro blems are i dentified during either routine or  comprehensive visits, \nthe PHA I from the Quality Assurance Section will work with provider \nstaff to create a corrective action plan.  A provider is required to take action to correct any VFC deficiencies within the specif ied time given.  \nFailure to do so may result  in vaccine delivery suspension, termination \nof the VFC enrollment, or possibl e prosecution.   \n \nQuality Improvement (AFIX Site Visit) \nThe PHA II from the VFC Program Quality Improvement \nSection  will regularly conduct  quality improvement visit s, \nalso known as  AFIX.  AFIX  is a continuous quality \nimprovement (CQI) process that is used for : \n  \nAssessment of immunization levels;  \n  \nFeedback of immunization information to the provider ; \n Incentives to motivate/and or recog nize performance, and  \n eXchange of information on best immunization practices.  \n AFIX  is an effective strategy to improve provider practices and raise  \nimmunization coverage rates.  VFC providers should expect at least one AFIX visit every two to three year s. \n \nDuring this visit, the PHA II from the VFC Program Quality Improvement \nSection will: \n\u2022 Use either pat ient records at the provider office or electronic \nrecords  through the electronic medical record system (EMR) or I -\nCARE (immunization registry);  \n\u2022 Conduct a thorough, objective and systematic review of a \nselected sample of patient records ; \n\u2022 Administer a brief questionnaire about immunization practices ; \n\u2022 Provide feedback  and a report  of assessment findings  (see \nSample Report ) \n\u2022 During the feedback session, e ngage  the provider in meaningful \ndialogue for quality improvement planning ; \n\u2022 Offer incentives for participation in  improvement activities ; \n\u2022 Share ideas, resources and best practices related to immunization.  \n \nUsing  Assessment Results to Raise  \nProvider Immunization  Coverage  \nFrequently, the AFIX chart asses sment reveals \nthat many children\u2019s immunizations are not up- to-\ndate for their age. The C DC\u2019s Healthy People 202 0 \ngoal is for 8 0% of children ages 19- 35 months  to \nhave completed the 4:3:1:3:3:1 series (4 DTaP: 3 Polio: 1 MMR: \n3 Hib: 3 Hep B: 1 Varicella) by 24 months of age1. However, very \nfew providers meet this goal  and rates of 70%, 50%, and even \n1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Healthy People 2010: Understanding and Improving \nHealth. 2nd ed. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, November 2000.  \n                                                                         30% are not uncommon. However, t he PHA II from the VFC \nProgram Quality Improvement Section can help clinics raise even  \nthe lowest rates.  \nAdolescent immunization coverage levels are also used to \ndetermine if providers are adequately immunizing their adolescent patients with the recommended vaccines.   \n Providers often are surprised when they are informed that their rate is less than ideal, and desire to know why. The most common reasons for these low rates include missing opportunities to immunize, administering invalid doses, and not routinely identifying inactive patient records.  \n \nMissed Opportunities  \nMissed opportunities occur when a patient received  some \nimmunizations on their last visit, but one or more recommended \nshots were not given, for unknown reasons.  For instance, MMR \nwas given but not varicella, and there is no evidence of \nchickenpox disease documented on the im munization record. \nSince this vaccine was not given at subsequent visits, this  counts \nas a missed opportunity.  \n Quality improvement strategies to reduce missed opportunities include:  \n \n\u2022 Using a one page immunization summary  form  that \nprompts the provider to identify all missing immunizations ; \n\u2022 Giving all shots  needed at one visit;  \n\u2022 Updating the immunization record (to a newer version) \nto have room for all vaccines on the CDC\u2019s recommended schedule;  \n\u2022 Implementing use of  the state\u2019s immunization registry - \n\u201cI-CARE\u201d  (see the I-CARE flyer at the end of this section \nfor more information).  \n\u2022 Using Reminder/Recall Techniques:  Sending cards or \nmaking phone calls to parents to remind them of upcoming visits or of missed appointments.  \n \n \n Invalid doses  \nInvalid doses occur when a  patient received  vaccin es at a clinic \nvisit but one (or more) was given before the minimum age or \ninterval that the CDC has determined to be in effective.  For \ninstance, the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine must be given at a \nminimum of six months of age. If it is given more than four days before the patient\u2019s six -month birthday, it is considered an invalid \ndose. Invalid doses lower the coverage rate, and may contribute to the missed opportunity category  (if these doses could have \nbeen repeated at a subse quent immunization visit).  \n When vaccines are given elsewhere, providers may not notice if one or more invalid doses were administered . However, because \nthe chart assessment includes all  vaccines given, this will lower \nthe provider\u2019s coverage rate, even though the invalid shots were not given at his/her  clinic .  \n Quality improvement strategies to reduce invalid doses include:  \n \n\u2022 Referring to the current immunization schedule  for \nclarification of the minimum ages and intervals;  \n\u2022 Giving shots  at the proper inter vals and ages;  \n\u2022 Obtaining the previous immunization history  from \nparent or provider ; \n\u2022 Transcribing past immunization record\u2019s dates  to the \ncurrently used record;  \n\u2022 Repeating doses that were given too early at other \nclinics.  \nInactive patients  \nThis means that p atients who have not visited the provider\u2019s clinic \nin over a year were included in the assessment . A patient is \nconsidered active unless denoted as \u201cinactive.\u201d Evidence of the \npatient having moved away, or transferred to another clinic, is needed to exclude these patients from the analysis . Attempts \nshould be made to recall the patients  before changing their status \nto inactive.  \n  \n Quality improvement strategies to identify inactive patients : \n \n\u2022 Placing stickers on the edge of chart  to indicate year of \npatients \u2019 last visit so that inactive patients are not included \nin the assessments;  \n\u2022 Labeling patients\u2019 charts as \u201cInactive\u201d if no visits  \noccurred in the past year, or if correspondence is returned \ndue to \u201caddressee unknown\u201d or \u201cmoved.\u201d  \nThese activities have been s hown to be effective for raising \ncoverage rates and improving record- keeping. The quality \nimprovement  staff can explain and assist in implementing these \nstrategies.  \n \n \nTips to Prepare for Quality \nAssurance (QA) and Quality \nImprovement (QI) Visits  \n \n1. The pri mary vaccine coordinator in the clinic should be \navailable for at least  two hours to answer q uestions on the \nsurvey and discuss the findings.  (Both QA and QI)  \n2. Before the review, provide a list of 100 children 0- 18 years of \nage who have been immunized at least once during the past \nyear.  The VFC provider list must include both VFC and non-VFC eligible children (if applicable).  (Both QA and QI)  \n3. Before the review, l ocate the circuit breaker (s) for the vaccine \nstorage unit(s) for inspection.  (QA only)  \n4. Provide a space to work.  (Both QA and QI)  \n5. Before the review,  assemble  all of the most recent vaccine \nmanagement plans  for review.  (QA only)  \n6. The PHA I from the VFC Program Quality Assurance Section  \nwill need to review past temperature logs and inspect all vaccine s torage units (refrigerators and freezers). Before the \nreview, assemble at least 3 months of temperature logs. If problems are observed, more temperature logs will be required for the review. (QA only)  \n7. Admitting or billing personnel may be needed to clarify  \nscreening and billing processes.  (QA only ) \n 8. Current and past vaccine borrowing reports . (QA only)  \n9. If using electronic medical records (EMR), a provider staff \nperson must be available to help the VFC staff navigate the \nEMR.  (Both QA and QI)  \n10. Assure that the medical director (or equivalent) is present to \nhear the results and sign the Acknowledgement of Receipt. (Both QA and QI)  \n \n \nVFC and AFIX site visits are required components of the VFC \nProgram.   In general, providers will be notified before a site visit , and a \ntime and date will be agreed upon that is convenient for the provider.  \nHowever, please note that the VFC Program reserves the right to conduct unscheduled visits in response to incidents of vaccine loss, improper ordering procedures, and problems wit h temperature(s) in the \nappliance where VFC vaccine is stored or to conduct a vaccine inventory.   \n For more information regarding the quality assurance and quality improvement acti vities outlined in this section, please contact Marcia \nLevin, VFC Program M anager at 312. 746.6050.    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Section 5 Appendix  \n\u2022 Sample AFIX Summary Assessment Report  \n\u2022 HIPAA and Public Health Fact Sheet  \n\u2022 HIPAA and Public Health Visits  \u2013 Access to Patient Records \nduring AFIX and VFC Visits  \n\u2022 I-CARE Fact Sheet  (Registry System  \n CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nVaccine Administration and \nImmunization Schedules  \nVaccine Administration1 \nppropriate vaccine administration is critical to vaccine \neffectiveness. The recommended site, route and dosage for each vaccine are based on clinical trials, practical ex perience and \ntheoretical considerations. The following information provides general guidelines for administration of vaccines for those who administer vaccines, as well as those in training, education and supervisory positions. This information should be used in conjunction with professional standards for medication administration, vaccine manufacturers' product guidelines, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) General Recommendations on Immunization, the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) Report of the \nCommittee on Infectious Diseases Red Book , and state/agency -related \npolicies and procedures.  \nPreparation  \n\u2022 Patient Preparation -  Patients should be prepared for \nvaccination with consideration for their age and stage of \ndevelopment. Parents/guardians and patients should be encouraged to take an active role before, during and after the administration of vaccines.  \n \n\u2022 Screening - All patients should be screened for \ncontraindications and precautions for each scheduled \n1 Source: Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine- Preventable Diseases ( Pink Book ), February 2008, \nAppendix D  \n Section  \n6 \nA \nVaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules  \nSection 6 \u2013 Page 1 (Rev. 01/2012)                                                                          CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nvaccine. See sample screeni ng forms and list of Valid \nContraindications at the end of this section.   \n \n\u2022 Vaccine Safety & Risk Communication -  Parents/guardians \nand patients are exposed \nthrough the media to information about vaccines, some of which is inaccurate or misleading. Healthcare providers should be prepared to discuss the benefits and risks of vaccines using Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) and other \nreliable resources. Establishing an open dialogue provides a safe, trust -building environment in which individuals can freely \nevaluate information, discuss vaccine concerns and make informed decisions regarding immunization.  \n \n\u2022 Atraumatic Care -  Vaccine safety issues and the need for \nmultiple injections have increased the concerns and anxiety associated with immunizations. Heal thcare providers need to \ndisplay confidence and establish an environment that promotes a sense of security and trust for the patient and family, utilizing a variety of techniques to minimize the stress \nand discomfort associated with receiving injections.  \n \n\u2022 Positioning & Comforting Restraint -  The healthcare \nprovider must accommodate for the patient's comfort, safety, age, activity level, and the site of administration when considering patient positioning and restraint. For a child, the parent/guardian should  be encouraged to hold the child during \nadministration. If the parent is uncomfortable, another person may assist . For more information, refer to Comforting \nRestraints for Immunizations  at the end of this section .  \n \n\u2022 Pain Control -  Pain is a subjective phenomenon influenced \nby multiple factors, including an individual's age, anxiety level, previous healthcare experiences, and culture. Consideration for these factors is important as the provider develops a planned approach to management of injection pain.  \n \n\u2022 Infection Control -  Healthcare providers should follow \nStandard Precautions to minimize the risks of spreading disease during vaccine administration.  All administered \nvaccines should be \nfully documented in \nthe patient\u2019s record \nas previously \ndescribed under  \n\u201cDocumenting \nVaccines\u201d . \nVaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules  \nSection 6 \u2013 Page 2 (Rev. 01/2012)  CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \n \n1. Hand  washing - The single, most effective disease \nprevention activity is good hand washing . Hands should be  \nwashed thoroughly with soap and water or cleansed with \nan alcohol -based waterless antiseptic between patients, \nbefore vaccine preparation or any time hands become soiled.  \n \n2. Gloves - Gloves are not required to be worn when \nadministering vaccines unless the person administering \nthe vaccine is likely to come into contact with potentially infectious body fluids or has open lesions on the hands. It is important to remember that gloves cannot prevent needle stick  injuries.  \n \n3. Needle stick injuries - should be reported immediately to \nthe site supervisor, with appropriate care and follow -up \ngiven as directed by state/local guidelines. Safety needle devices should be used, if available to reduce the risk of injury.  \n \n4. Equipment Disposal -  Used needles should not be \ndetached from syringes, recapped or cut before disposal. \nAll used syringe/needle devices should be placed in puncture proof containers to prevent accidental needle \nsticks and reuse. Empty or expired vaccine vials are \nconsidered medical waste and should be dis posed of \naccording to state regulations.  \nEquipment Selection  \n1. Syringe Selection -  A separate needle and syringe should be \nused for each injection. Syringe devices with safety needles are available, recommended by OSHA  to reduce the \nincidence of needle stick  injuries and potential disease \ntransmission. Personnel should be involved in evaluation and selection of these products. Staff should receive training with these devices before using them in the clinical area.  \n \n2. Needle Selection - Vaccine must reach the desired tissue \nsite for optimal immune response. Therefore, needle selection should be based upon the prescribed route, size of the individual, volume and viscosity of the vaccine, and injection technique. For more information refer to Administering Vaccines: Dose, Route, Site, and Needle Size included at \nthe end of this section.   \nVaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules  \nSection 6 \u2013 Page 3 (Rev. 01/2012)  CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \n \n3. Inspecting Vaccine -  Each vaccine vial should be carefully \ninspected for damage or contamination prior to use. The \nexpiration date printed on the vial or box should be checked. Vaccine can be used through the last day of the month \nindicated by the expiration date unless otherwise stated on the package labeling. Expired vaccine should never be used.  \n \n4. Reconstitution - Some vaccines are prepared in a form that \nrequires reconstitution , which should be done according to \nmanufacturer guidelines. Diluent solutions vary; use only the specific diluent supplied for the vaccine. Once reconstituted, the vaccine must be either administered within the time guidelines provided by the manufacturer  or discarded. \nChanging the needle after reconstitution of the vaccine is not necessary unless the needle has become contaminated or bent. Continue with standard medication preparation guidelines.  \n \n5. Pre-filling Syringes -  CDC strongly discourages filling \nsyringes in advance, because of the increased risk of administration errors. Once the vaccine is in the syringe it is difficult to identify the type or brand of vaccine. Other problems associated with this practice are vaccine wastage, and possible bacterial growth in vaccines that do not contain a \npreservative. Furthermore, medication administration guidelines state that the individual who administers a medication should be the one to draw up and prepare it. An alternative to pre- filling syringes is to use filled syringes \nsupplied by the vaccine manufacturer. Syringes other than those filled by the manufacturer are designed for immediate administration, not for vaccine storage. In certain circumstances, such as a large influenza clinic, more than one syringe  can be filled. One person should pre- fill only a few \nsyringes at a time, and the same person should administer them. Any syringes left at the end of the clinic day should be discarded. Under no circum stances should MMR, varicella, or \nzoster vaccines ever be reconstituted and drawn prior to the \nimmediate need for them. These live virus vaccines are unstable and begin to deteriorate as soon as they are reconstituted with diluent.  \n \n6. Labeling - Once a vaccine is drawn into a syringe, the \ncontent should be indi cated on the syringe. There are a \nvariety of methods for identifying or labeling syringes (e.g. \nVaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules  \nSection 6 \u2013 Page 4 (Rev. 01/2012)  CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nkeep syringes with the appropriate vaccine vials, place the \nsyringes in a labeled partitioned tray, or use color coded or preprinted labels).  \nAppendix D   \nAdmini stration Route  \nAdministering a vaccine by the recommended route is imperative. Deviation from the recommended route of administration might reduce vaccine efficacy or increase the risk of local reactions .  For detailed \nillustrations refer to Administering Vaccines: Dose, Route, Site, and \nNeedle Size; How to Administer Intramuscular/Subcutaneous \nInjections ; and Comforting Restraint  included at the end of this \nsection.  \n 1. Subcutaneous (Sub -Q or SC) injections are administered at a 45\u00b0 \nangle into the fatty tissu e found below the dermis and above muscle \ntissue. Subcutaneous tissue can be found all over the body. The usual sites for vaccine administration are the thigh (for infants <12 months of age) and the upper outer triceps of the arm (for persons >12 months of  age). If necessary, the upper outer triceps area can \nbe used to administer subcutaneous injections to infants.  \n\u2022 Needle Gauge & Length -  5/8-inch, 23-  to 25 -gauge needle  \n\u2022 Technique - Follow standard medication administration \nguidelines for site assessment/ selection and site preparation. To \navoid reaching the muscle, pinch up the fatty tissue, insert the needle at a 45\u00b0 angle and inject the vaccine into the tissue. Withdraw the needle and apply light pressure to the injection site for several seconds with a dry cotton ball or gauze.  \n \n2. Intramuscular (IM) injections are administered at a 90\u00b0 Angle  into \nmuscle tissue below the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Although there are several IM injection sites on the body, the recommended IM sites for vaccine administra tion are the vastus lateralis muscle \n(anterolateral thigh) and the deltoid muscle (upper arm). The site depends on the age of the individual and the degree of muscle development.  \n\u2022 Needle Gauge  - 1-inch 22-  to 25 -gauge needle  \n\u2022 Needle Length -  For all intram uscular injections, the needle \nshould be long enough to reach the muscle mass and prevent vaccine from seeping into subcutaneous tissue, but not so long as to involve underlying nerves, blood vessels, or bone. The vaccinator should be familiar with the ana tomy of the \nVaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules  \nSection 6 \u2013 Page 5 (Rev. 01/2012)  CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \narea into which the vaccine will be injected. Decision on \nneedle size and site of injection must be made for each person on the basis of the size of the muscle, the thickness of adipose tissue at the injection site, the volume of the material to be administered, injection technique, and the depth below \nthe muscle surface into which the material is to be injected  \n\u2022 Technique - For the majority of infants \n(younger than 12 months), the anterolateral aspect of the thigh is the recommended site for i njection because \nit provides a large muscle mass. The muscles of the buttock have not been used for administration of vaccines in infants and children because of concern about potential injury to the sciatic nerve, which is well documented after injection of antimicrobial agents into the buttock. Injection technique is the most important factor to ensure efficient intramuscular vaccine delivery.  \n \n3. Aspiration - Aspiration is the process of pulling back on the \nplunger of the syringe prior to injection to ensure that the medication is not injected into a blood vessel. Although this \npractice is advocated by some experts, the procedure is not \nrequired because no large blood vessels exist at the \nrecommended injection sites.  \n 4. Multiple Vaccinations -  When administe ring multiple vaccines, \nNEVER mix vaccines in the same syringe unless approved for mixing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If more than one vaccine must be administered in the same limb, the injection sites should be separated by 1- 2 inches so that any local \nreactions can be differentiated. Vacci ne doses range from 0.2 mL \nto 1 mL. The recommended maximum volume of medication for an IM site, varies among references and depends on the muscle mass of the individual. However, administering two IM vacc ines \ninto the same muscle would not exceed any suggested volume ranges for either the vastus lateralis or the deltoid muscle in any age group. The option to also administer a subcutaneous vaccine into the same limb, if necessary, is acceptable since a diff erent \ntissue site is involved. If a vaccine and an immune globulin preparation are administered simultaneously (e.g., Td/Tdap and tetanus immune globulin [TIG] or hepatitis B vaccine and For newborn (first \n28 days of life) and premature \ninfants, a 5/8 inch \nneed le usually is \nadequate if the \nskin is stretched \nflat between \nthumb and \nforefinger and the needle inserted at \na 90- degree angle \nto the skin.  \nVaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules  \nSection 6 \u2013 Page 6 (Rev. 01/2012)  CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nhepatitis B immune globulin [HBIG]), a separate anatomic site \nshould be used for each injection. The location of each injection \nshould be documented in the patient\u2019s medical record.  \n \n5. Nonstandard Administration - Deviation from the \nrecommended route, site and dosage of vaccine is strongly discouraged and can result in inadequate protection. In situations where nonstandard administration has occurred, refer to the \nACIP General Recommendation on Immunization, MMWR 2006; \n55 (RR -15 p.18), for specific guidance.  \n \nSpecial Situations  \n1. Bleeding Disorders -  Individuals with a bleeding  disorder or \nwho are receiving anticoagulant therapy may develop \nhematomas in IM injection sites. Prior to administration of IM vaccines the patient or family should be instructed about the risk of hematoma formation from the injection. Additionally, a physician familiar with the patient's bleeding disorder or \ntherapy should be consulted regarding the safety of administration by this route. If the patient periodically receives hemophilia replacement factor or other similar therapy, IM vaccine administration  should ideally be scheduled shortly \nafter replacement therapy. A 23- gauge or finer needle should \nbe used and firm pressure applied to the site for at least 2 minutes. The site should not be rubbed or massaged.  \n 2. Latex Allergy - Administration of a vaccine supplied in a vial \nor syringe that contains natural rubber (refer to product information) should not be administered to an individual with a history of a severe (anaphylactic) allergy to latex, unless the benefit of vaccination clearly outweighs the risk of an allergic reaction. These situations are rare. Medical consultation and direction should be sought regarding vaccination. A local or contact sensitivity to latex is not a contraindication to vaccination.  \n 3. Syncopal or Vasovagal Response (\"fainting\") m ay occur \nduring vaccine administration, especially with adolescents and adults. Because individuals may fall and sustain injury as a result, the provider should have the patient sit during injection(s) as well as monitor the patient for 15 minutes after they are vaccinated. A syncopal or vasovagal response is not \ncommon and is not an allergic reaction. However, if syncope \nVaccine Administration and Immunization Schedules  \nSection 6 \u2013 Page 7 (Rev. 01/2012)  CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \ndevelops, the provider should observe and administer \nsupportive care until the patient is recovered.  \n 4. Anaphylaxis (a life -threatening ac ute allergic reaction) -  Each \nfacility that administers vaccines should have a protocol, procedures and equipment to provide initial care for suspected anaphylaxis. Facility staff should be prepared to recognize and respond appropriately to this type of emergency situation. All staff should maintain current CPR \ncertification. Emergency protocols, procedures and equipment/supplies should be reviewed periodically. For additional information on medical management of vaccine reactions in children, teens, and adults, see the 2006 ACIP General Recommen dations on Immunization (p. 19),  the 2006 \nAAP Red Book (pp. 64- 66), and Appendix D18- D21 of the \n2008 Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine Preventable \nDiseases (Pink Book ). \n \nImmunization Schedule  \nThe Advisory Commit tee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  annually \npublishes immunization schedules that summarize recommendations for \ncurrently licensed vaccines for children  aged 18 years and younger. The \ncurrent  schedule is included in this section.    \nParents often have questions about the immunization schedule and \nvaccine ingredients.

The following section provides information about reporting of infectious diseases to the Chicago \nDepartment of Public Health (CDPH ) and adverse events following \nadministration of vaccines to CDPH and the federal Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS).  \n \nHealthcare Provider Responsibility to Report  \nIt is the responsibility of physicians, physician assistants, nurses, medical assistants  or any other person having knowledge of any of the \nreportable diseases, confirmed or suspected, to report the case to the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) within the specified time frame.  A list of reportable infectious diseases and conditions in \nIllinois is provided at the end of this section .   \nTo report a case of vaccine preventable disease call:  \nCDPH Vaccine Preventable Disease Surveillance  \n312.746.5911  \n \nOn weekends, holidays, after hours, or if no one is available to take your call, reports may be made by calling 311 and asking for the \ncommunicable disease physician on call.  \nVaccine Adverse Events Reporting System  \nWhat is  VAERS?  \nThe Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a \nnational program that monitors the safety of v accines after they \nare licensed. VAERS is managed by the U.S. Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA). Vaccines prevent serious illnesses Section  \n7 \nC \nPublic Health Reporting  \nSection 7 \u2013 Page 1 (Rev. 01/2012)  CHICAGO DE PARTMENT OF PUBLIC H EALTH  \nVACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK  \n \nand even death in persons who receive them. Before a vaccine is \nlicensed, FDA takes steps to make sure the vaccine is safe. FDA \nrequires that a vaccine goes through extensive safety testing. \nAfter a vaccine is licensed, VAERS is one of the mechanisms used to monitor for any problems, or \u201cadverse events,\u201d  that \nhappen after vaccination.  \n Not all events reported to VAERS are caused by the vaccine. \nEven though careful studies are done before a vaccine is \nlicensed, rare adverse effects may not be found until a vaccine is given to millions of people with different backgrounds and \nmedical histories. By continued monitoring, VAERS helps to \nmake sure that the benefits of vaccines are far greater than the risks.  \n \nAnyone who receives a vaccine should be \ninformed about both the benefits and risks of vaccination. Any questions or concerns should be discussed with a healthcare provider.  \nWho Can Report to VAERS?  \nFDA and CDC encourage anybody who experiences any \nproblems after vaccination to report to VAERS.  This includes \nparents, patients, and healthcare providers.  Healthcare pr oviders \nare required by law to report certain problems.

To prevent perinatal transmission, the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that infants b orn to hepatitis B -infected women be administered HBIG \nand the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series within 12 hours of birth and complete the hepatitis B vaccine series on time.  \n The Chicago Perinatal Hepatitis B Program works with health care \nproviders, mothers and their babies to assure the proper health care is \nprovided to at -risk families. When a baby is born in the city of Chicago to a \nhepatitis B infected mother, the Perinatal Hepatitis B staff work diligently to \ncoordinate care and delivery of necessary immunizations.   \nThe Illinois State Law has set out specific mandates for identifying, testing, documenting, reporting, and managing perinatal hepatitis B cases.  Since \n2006 there have been no changes to perinatal hepatitis B prevention protocols .

Expired vaccine must never be used and \nis money wasted!\nAlways use the vaccine with the soonest  \nexpiration date first. \nMove vaccine with the soonest expiration date to the front  \nof the storage unit and mark it to be used first. Keep vaccine \nvials in their original boxes. \nStore vaccine appropriately.\u2020 \nPlace vaccines in refrigerator or freezer immediately upon \nreceiving shipment. Keep vaccine vials in their original pack -\naging. Place vaccine in clearly labeled wire baskets or other \nopen containers with a 2\u20133\" separation between baskets and \nfrom wall of unit. Separate vaccines that have been supplied \nfrom your state\u2019s Vaccines for Children program from vac -\ncines that are privately purchased. Do not store vaccines in \nthe door or on the floor of the unit.Stabilize temperatures.\nStore ice packs in the freezer and large jugs of water in the \nrefrigerator along with the vaccines. This will help maintain a \nstable, cold temperature in case of a power failure or if the re -\nfrigerator or freezer doors are opened frequently or left open. \nFrequent opening of either the refrigerator or freezer door \ncan lead to temperature variations inside, which could affect  \nvaccine efficacy. For this reason you should not store food \nor beverages in the refrigerator or freezer.\nSafeguard the electrical supply to the refrigerator.  \nMake sure the refrigerator and freezer are plugged into outlets \nin a protected area where they cannot be disconnected ac -\ncidentally. Label the refrigerator, freezer, electrical outlets, \nfuses, and circuit breakers on the power circuit with informa -\ntion that clearly identifies the perishable nature of vaccines \nand the immediate steps to be taken in case of interruption \nof power.

August 11, 2003)  \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and Public Health  \n \nFact Sheet  \n \nWhat is HIPAA?  \n \nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104 -191) established a \nnational floor of consumer privacy protection and marketpl ace reform. Some key provisions include: \ninsurance reforms, privacy and security, administrative simplification, and cost savings.  \n \nWhat is the HIPAA Privacy Rule?  \n \nHIPAA required Congress to enact privacy legislation by August 1999 or the Secretary of DHH S was to \ndevelop regulations protecting privacy. The HIPAA Privacy Rule (Standards for Privacy of Individually \nIdentifiable Health Information) sets national minimal standards for protected health information.  \n \nImplications for Public Health  \n \nThe Privacy R ule strikes a balance between protecting patient information and allowing traditional \npublic health activities to continue. Disclosure of patient health information without the authorization of \nthe individual is permitted for purposes including but not lim ited to:  disclosures required by law (45 CFR \n\u00a7 164.512(a)) or for \u201cpublic health activities and purposes.\u201d This includes disclosure to \u201ca public health \nauthority that is authorized by law to collect or receive such information for the purpose of preventing  \nor controlling disease, injury, or disability, including but not limited to, the reporting of disease, injury, \nvital events..., and the conduct of public health surveillance,... investigations, and... interventions.\u201d (45 \nCFR \u00a7 164.512(b)(i))  \n \nDefinition o f Public Health Authority  \n \nDefined as \u201can agency or authority of the United States, a State, a territory, a political subdivision of a \nState or territory, or an Indian tribe, or a person or entity acting under a grant of authority from or \ncontract with suc h public agency, including the employees or agents of such public agency or its \ncontractors or persons or entities to whom it has granted authority, that is responsible for public health \nmatters as part of its official mandates.\u201d (45 CFR \u00a7 164.501)  \n \nFor mo re information regarding HIPAA and vaccines, visit the CDC website at:  \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac -gen/policies/hipaa/default.htm  \n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  \nNational Center for Infectious and Respiratory Diseases  \nImmunization Services Division  \n \n \nRev. August 11, 20 03           1 \n \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and Public Health Visits  \nAccess to Patient Records during AFIX and VFC Visits  \n \nResponses to Frequently Asked Questions about AFIX and VFC  \n \nThis guidance is intended to give health care providers and publi c health agencies specific information \nregarding the HIPAA Privacy Rule and access to patient records during Assessment, Feedback, \nIncentives, Exchange (AFIX) and Vaccines for Children (VFC) site visits. Several frequently asked \nquestions posed to the CDC legal counsel for interpretation are presented below. Additional sources of \ninformation and reference materials available on the internet are also included.  \n \nCan patient records be reviewed by health department staff, or their contractual agents such as th e \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) or the Visiting Nurses Association (VNA), for the purpose of \nconducting AFIX provider site visits?  \n \nYes. Under 45 CFR \u00a7 164.512(b) of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, covered entities may disclose protected \nhealth information  without authorization to public health authorities that are authorized by law to \ncollect such information for public health purposes. AFIX, authorized under section 317 of the Public \nHealth Service Act, is a public health strategy to raise immunization co verage levels and improve \nstandards of practices at the provider level. AFIX providers, as covered entities, may share patient \nrecords with health department staff or their contractors because a health department is a public health \nauthority authorized by law to review patient records for AFIX purposes, or because health department \ncontractors are acting under a grant of authority from a public health authority. In addition, state health \ndepartments may have authority under applicable state law to collect t his information.  \n \nCan patient records be reviewed by health officials or their agents for the purpose of conducting VFC \nprovider site visits?  \n \nYes. As explained in the answer to question 1 above, under 45 CFR \u00a7 164.512(b) of the HIPAA Privacy \nRule, covere d entities may disclose protected health information without authorization to public health \nauthorities that are authorized by law to collect such information for public health purposes. VFC is a \npublic health program that provides vaccines for children in  certain eligibility groups. The VFC program \nwas authorized under Section 1928 of the Social Security Act and has been delegated to CDC to \nadminister. VFC providers, as covered entities, may share patient records with health officials or their \nagents becau se a health department is a public health authority authorized by law to review patient \nrecords for VFC purposes, or because contractors are acting under a grant of authority from a public \nhealth authority.  \n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  \nNational Center for Infectious and Respiratory Diseases  \nImmunization Services Division  \n \n \nRev. August 11, 20 03           2 \n \n \nResponses to Frequently Asked Questions about AFIX and VFC  \n \nAre VFC providers required to allow health officials access to the immunization records of children in \ntheir practice to determine compliance with VFC requirements?  \n \nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule permits providers to share immunization records with  public health officials for \npublic health purposes as otherwise authorized by law. Under the VFC statute, at 42 U.S.C. 1396s(c)(2), \nas a condition of participation in the VFC program providers must share immunization records with \nhealth officials to verif y compliance with VFC program requirements, including:  \n \n1. screening of all children in their practice to determine VFC eligibility;  \n2. to determine provider compliance with the VFC immunization schedule regarding the \nappropriate periodicity, dosage and contrai ndications applicable to the vaccines;  \n3. to determine provider compliance with applicable State law, including any such law relating to \nany religious or other exemption;  \n4. to verify that VFC vaccine -eligible children are not being charged for the cost of the  vaccine;  \n5. to verify that any administration fees being charged do not exceed the caps established by CMS;  \n6. to verify that the provider does not deny administration of vaccine to vaccine -eligible children \ndue to the inability of the child\u2019s parent to pay a n administration fee.  \n \nCan health care providers, daycare operators, Head Start and school officials share immunization \ninformation with another provider or school to update missing immunization history or bring children \ninto compliance with daycare, Head  Start and school requirements?  \n \nHealth care providers (or other covered entities) may share immunization information with other health \ncare providers as needed to make treatment decisions, such as to give further immunizations. Providers \nmay also disclos e immunization information to schools, without authorization, if permitted or required \nby State law. These State laws would not be preempted by the Privacy Rule. (45 CFR 160.203(c)). In the \nabsence of such a State law, it appears that such disclosures to s chools will require individual \nauthorization. Immunization records held by day care centers and schools are not protected health \ninformation under the Privacy Rule. Disclosures of immunization information by schools is covered by \nthe Family Educational Rig hts and Privacy Act (FERPA). (45 CFR 164.501).  \n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  \nNational Center for Infectious and Respiratory Diseases  \nImmunization Services Division  \n \n \nRev. August 11, 20 03           3 \n \n \nResponses to Frequently Asked Questions about AFIX and VFC  \n \nCan patient identifiers, including name and birthdate, be collected and stored electronically, \nincidental to AFIX or VFC visits?  \n \nYes. Under 45 C FR \u00a7 164.512(b) of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, covered entities may disclose protected \nhealth information --including name, birthdate, and other individually identifiable health information --to \npublic health authorities that are authorized by law to collect suc h information for public health \npurposes. However, other requirements of the Privacy Rule (including minimum necessary, verification \nof identity, and accounting requirements) may apply to covered entities making these disclosures. For a \nfull explanation of  these requirements, see the website of the Office for Civil Rights \n(www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa) (responsible for enforcing the Privacy Rule), or CDC/DHHS guidance on the \nPrivacy Rule and Public Health, in the MMWR, HIPAA Privacy Rule and Public Health (printab le version is \navailable at www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/other/m2e411.pdf ).  \n \nOnce protected health information has been disclosed to a public health authority for a public health \nactivity pursuant to section 164.512(b) of the Privacy Rule, the information may be s tored in whatever \nway is reasonable for conducting the public health activity, including electronically, so long as the \nstorage is consistent with other applicable State and Federal law.  \n \n \n \nLinks to additional sources of information may be found on the CDC  website at \nwww.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/ or by returning to the HIPAA Policies page.  \n  \n(Source: http://www.idph.state.il.us/health/vaccine/icarefs.html ) \nWhat is I -CARE?  \nI-CARE, or Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange is an immunization record -sharing \ncomputer program developed by the Illinois Department of Public  Health. The program allows public and private health \ncare providers to share the immunization records of Illinois residents. Currently, the program contains more than 37 \nmillion immunization records.  \nBesides keeping track of the immunizations a child has already received, I -CARE forecasts immunization due dates based \non the nationally recognized \u201cRecommended Childhood Immunization Schedule.\u201d These recommendations are approved \nby the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the American Academy of Pedi atrics and the American Academy \nof Family Physicians.  \nWhat is the purpose of I -CARE?  \nI-CARE is designed to help health care providers record, track and report their patients\u2019 immunizations. Participation is \nvoluntary. The registry allows physicians to acce ss patient records for information about immunizations administered \noutside their practices.  \nWhat is the goal of I -CARE?  \nThe primary goal of I -CARE is to increase the immunization coverage level of Illinois\u2019 2 -year-olds to 90 percent. In 2008, \napproximatel y 77 percent of Illinois\u2019 2 -year-olds were properly immunized, according to a National Immunization \nSurvey.  \nWhile this goal focuses on 2 -year-olds, keep in mind that patients of all ages can be included in the I -CARE program.  \nHow does I -CARE work?  \nI-CARE u sers can exchange data with the statewide registry in one of two ways:  \n\uf0b7 Electronic Data Interchange (coming soon)  \n\uf0b7 I-CARE Web -based computer program  \nElectronic Data Interchange allows the sharing of electronic data in a structured HL7 (Health Level 7 stand ard) \ncompatible format between computer programs. It allows health care facilities with their own HL7 compatible \nimmunization tracking programs to share information with I -CARE.  \nThe I -CARE computer program is robust, allowing health care providers to colle ct, store, analyze and report \nimmunization data at individual sites.  \nHere are the main features of the computer program:  \n\uf0b7 Calculation of immunization due dates  \n\uf0b7 Print option for school physical form and patient immunization history report  \uf0b7 Remind/Recall fea ture to track and notify patients of due dates  \n\uf0b7 Vaccine inventory feature to track usage by lot number  \n\uf0b7 Record of patient contraindications, adverse reactions or immunities  \n\uf0b7 Assessment of immunization coverage levels for a practice  \n\uf0b7 Appointment feature to log and notify patients due for shots  \n\uf0b7 Refrigerator/Freezer Temperature Log feature to track and report vaccine storage appliances  \n\uf0b7 Report creation feature for several required forms and reports  \n\uf0b7 Vaccine Information Statement module to update and print VIS  forms and report  \nWhat about security and patient confidentiality?  \nI-CARE is designed to protect patient confidentiality while providing access to statewide registry information. \nConfidentiality is maintained through several security controls.  \nOpen access  to the statewide registry is not allowed. Only registered I -CARE users have access to the data and \ninformation is available only on a need -to-know basis. In other words, an I -CARE user cannot browse through patient \nrecords. Specific name or ID search crit eria must be used to access information in the statewide registry.  \nAn audit log at the statewide registry tracks all updates to patient records and which I -CARE user made each update. In \naddition, a site can only produce reports for patients seen at its cl inic site.  \nWhat kind of equipment is needed to operate I -CARE?  \nA high -speed Internet connection is needed to access the I -CARE Web site and Adobe Reader is used to open and print \nreports and forms.  \nWhat if a patient does not want to participate in I -CARE?  \nAs of July 1, 2011, I -CARE switched from an opt -in to an opt -out registry . This change to the registry now requires health \ncare providers using I -CARE to provide a new patient or the patient\u2019s parent/guardian with a printed immunization data \nexemption for m only once, prior to entering immunization records into I -CARE.  The new \u201copt -out\u201d registry will improve \nimmunization data reporting by allowing physicians and health departments to enter all patient immunization data into the \nregistry unless the patient o r parent chooses to opt -out. \nA fact sheet is available  to provide parents/patients with information about the benefits of including their immunization \nrecords on the statewide database. This form should supplement the  \u201copt-out\u201d form  when a provider is addi ng a new \npatient. This will provide the parent/patient with the necessary information about I -CARE and hopefully prevent them \nfrom reflectively signing the \u201copt -out\u201d form without reading it first.  \nKeep in mind that any patient, of any age, can be included in your local I -CARE clinic, thereby allowing you to use the \nprogram\u2019s tracking and reporting capabilities for all of your patients.  \n(Source: http://illinoisaap.org/2011/09/i -care-now-an-opt-out-registry/)  \nHow do I register to use I -CARE?  \nContact the Illin ois Department of Public Health if you would like to register for the I -CARE program. License \nagreements and other registration materials will be sent to you to complete and return. The department will then send you \ninstructions to create a Web portal (Int ernet) account to access I -CARE.  \nIf you would like to register for I -CARE or if you have questions, please call the Department\u2019s Immunization Registry \nstaff at 800 -526-4372 Staff are available 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine. (Minimum age: birth)\nRoutine vaccination:  \nAt birth:\u2022\tAdminister monovalent HepB vaccine to all newborns before hospital discharge.\n\u2022\tFor infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers, administer HepB vaccine and 0.5 mL of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. These infants should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) 1 to 2 months after completion of the HepB series, at age 9 through 18 months (preferably at the next well-child visit). \n\u2022\tIf mother\u2019s HBsAg status is unknown, within 12 hours of birth administer HepB vaccine regardless of birth weight. For infants weighing less than 2,000 grams, administer HBIG in addition to HepB vaccine within 12 hours of birth. Determine mother\u2019s HBsAg status as soon as possible and, if mother is HBsAg-positive, also administer HBIG for infants weighing 2,000 grams or more as soon as possible, but no later than age 7 days.\nDoses following the birth dose:\u2022\tThe second dose should be administered at age 1 or 2 months. Monovalent HepB vaccine should be used for doses administered before age 6 weeks.\n\u2022\tInfants who did not receive a birth dose should receive 3 doses of a HepB-containing vaccine on a schedule of 0, 1 to 2 months, and 6 months starting as soon as feasible. See Figure 2.\n\u2022\tAdminister the second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose (minimum interval of 4 weeks), administer the third dose at least 8 weeks after the second dose AND at least 16 weeks after the first dose. The final (third or fourth) dose in the HepB vaccine series should be administered no earlier than age 24 weeks . \n\u2022\tAdministration of a total of 4 doses of HepB vaccine is permitted when a combination vaccine containing HepB is administered after the birth dose. \nCatch-up vaccination:\u2022\tUnvaccinated persons should complete a 3-dose series.\n\u2022\tA 2-dose series (doses separated by at least 4 months) of adult formulation Recombivax HB is licensed for use in children aged 11 through 15 years. \n\u2022\tFor other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2.\n2. Rotavirus (RV) vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for both RV1 [Rotarix] and RV5 [RotaTeq])Routine vaccination:Administer a series of RV vaccine to all infants as follows: \n1. If Rotarix is used, administer a 2-dose series at 2 and 4 months of age. \n2. If RotaTeq is used, administer a 3-dose series at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. \n3. If any dose in the series was RotaTeq or vaccine product is unknown for any dose in the series, a total of 3 doses of RV vaccine should be administered. \nCatch-up vaccination:\u2022\tThe maximum age for the first dose in the series is 14 weeks, 6 days; vaccination should not be initiated for infants aged 15 weeks, 0 days or older.\n\u2022\tThe maximum age for the final dose in the series is 8 months, 0 days.\n\u2022\tFor other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2.3. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. (Minimum age: 6 weeks. Exception: DTaP-IPV [Kinrix]: 4 years)Routine vaccination:\u2022\tAdminister a 5-dose series of DTaP vaccine at ages 2, 4, 6, 15 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years. The fourth dose may be administered as early as age 12 months, provided at least 6 months have elapsed since the third dose.\nCatch-up vaccination:\n\u2022\tThe fifth dose of DTaP vaccine is not necessary if the fourth dose was administered at age 4 years or older.\n\u2022\tFor other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2.\n4. Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. (Minimum age: 10 years for Boostrix, 11 years for Adacel)Routine vaccination:  \n\u2022\tAdminister 1 dose of Tdap vaccine to all adolescents aged 11 through 12 years.\n\u2022\tTdap may be administered regardless of the interval since the last tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine.\n\u2022\tAdminister 1 dose of Tdap vaccine to pregnant adolescents during each pregnancy (preferred during 27 through 36 weeks gestation) regardless of time since prior Td or Tdap vaccination. \nCatch-up vaccination:\u2022\tPersons aged 7 years and older who are not fully immunized with DTaP vaccine should receive Tdap vaccine as 1 (preferably the first) dose in the catch-up series; if additional doses are needed, use Td vaccine. For children 7 through 10 years who receive a dose of Tdap as part of the catch-up series, an adolescent Tdap vaccine dose at age 11 through 12 years should NOT be administered. Td should be administered instead 10 years after the Tdap dose.\n\u2022\tPersons aged 11 through 18 years who have not received Tdap vaccine should receive a dose followed by tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) booster doses every 10 years thereafter.\n\u2022\tInadvertent doses of DTaP vaccine:\n -If administered inadvertently to a child aged 7 through 10 years may count as part of the catch-up series. This dose may count as the adolescent Tdap dose, or the child can later receive a Tdap booster dose at age 11 through 12 years. \n -If administered inadvertently to an adolescent aged 11 through 18 years, the dose should be counted as the adolescent Tdap booster. \n\u2022\tFor other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2.\n5. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine.  (Minimum age:  6 weeks for PRP-T [ACTHIB, DTaP-IPV/Hib (Pentacel) and Hib-MenCY (MenHibrix)], PRP-OMP [PedvaxHIB or COMVAX], 12 months for PRP-T [Hiberix]) Routine vaccination:\u2022\tAdminister a 2- or 3-dose Hib vaccine primary series and a booster dose (dose 3 or 4 depending on vaccine used in primary series) at age 12 through 15 months to complete a full Hib vaccine series.\n\u2022\tThe primary series with ActHIB, MenHibrix, or Pentacel consists of 3 doses and should be administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The primary series with PedvaxHib or COMVAX consists of 2 doses and should be administered at 2 and 4 months of age; a dose at age 6 months is not indicated.\n\u2022\tOne booster dose (dose 3 or 4 depending on vaccine used in primary series) of any Hib vaccine should be administered at age 12 through 15 months. An exception is Hiberix vaccine. Hiberix should only be used for the booster (final) dose in children aged 12 months through 4 years who have received at least 1 prior dose of Hib-containing vaccine.Footnotes \u2014 Recommended immunization schedule for persons aged 0 through 18 years\u2014United States, 2014  \nFor further guidance on the use of the vaccines mentioned below, see: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html . \nFor vaccine recommendations for persons 19 years of age and older, see the adult immunization schedule.\nAdditional information\n\u2022\tFor contraindications and precautions to use of a vaccine and for additional information regarding that vaccine, vaccination providers should consult the relevant ACIP statement available online \nat http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html . \n\u2022\tFor purposes of calculating intervals between doses, 4 weeks = 28 days.

For children aged 19 through 23 months who have not completed a series of MenHibrix or Menveo, administer 2 primary doses of Menveo at least 3 months apart.\n3. For children aged 24 months and older who have not received a complete series of MenHibrix or Menveo or Menactra, administer 2 primary doses of either Menactra or Menveo at least 2 months apart. If Menactra is administered to a child with asplenia (including sickle cell disease), do not administer Menactra until 2 years of age and at least 4 weeks after the completion of all PCV13 doses.\n\u2022\tChildren with persistent complement component deficiency:\n1. For children younger than 19 months of age, administer a 4-dose infant series of either MenHibrix or Menveo at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of age. \n2. For children 7 through 23 months who have not initiated vaccination, two options exist depending on age and vaccine brand: a. For children who initiate vaccination with Menveo at 7 months through 23 months of age, a 2-dose series should be administered with the second dose after 12 months of age and at least 3 months after the first dose. \nb. For children who initiate vaccination with Menactra at 9 months through 23 months of age, a 2-dose series of Menactra should be administered at least 3 months apart.\nc. For children aged 24 months and older who have not received a complete series of MenHibrix, Menveo, or Menactra, administer 2 primary doses of either Menactra or Menveo at least 2 months apart. \n\u2022\tFor children who travel to or reside in countries in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic, including countries in the African meningitis belt or the Hajj, administer an age- appropriate formulation and series of Menactra or Menveo for protection against serogroups A and W meningococcal disease. Prior receipt of MenHibrix is not sufficient for children traveling to the meningitis belt or the Hajj because it does not contain serogroups A or W. \n\u2022\tFor children at risk during a community outbreak attributable to a vaccine serogroup, administer or complete an age- and formulation-appropriate series of MenHibrix, Menactra, or Menveo.\n\u2022\tFor booster doses among persons with high-risk conditions, refer to MMWR 2013; 62(RR02);1-22, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a1.htm.\nCatch-up recommendations for persons with high-risk conditions:\n1. If MenHibrix is administered to achieve protection against meningococcal disease, a complete age-appropriate series of MenHibrix should be administered.\n2. If the first dose of MenHibrix is given at or after 12 months of age, a total of 2 doses should be given at least 8 weeks apart to ensure protection against serogroups C and Y meningococcal disease.\n3. For children who initiate vaccination with Menveo at 7 months through 9 months of age, a 2-dose series should be administered with the second dose after 12 months of age and at least 3 months after the first dose.\n4. For other catch-up recommendations for these persons, refer to MMWR 2013; 62(RR02);1-22, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a1.htm.\nFor complete information on use of meningococcal vaccines, including guidance related to vaccination of persons at increased risk of infection, see MMWR March 22, 2013;

Vaccine package inserts and the full ACIP recommendations for these vaccines should \nbe consulted for additional information on vaccine-related contraindications and pre -\ncautions and for more information on vaccine excipients. Events or conditions listed \nas precautions should be reviewed carefully. Benefits of and risks for administering a \nspecific vaccine to a person under these circumstances should be considered. If the \nrisk from the vaccine is believed to outweigh the benefit, the vaccine should not be ad -\nministered. If the benefit of vaccination is believed to outweigh the risk, the vaccine \nshould be administered. A contraindication is a condition in a recipient that increases \nthe chance of a serious adverse reaction. Therefore, a vaccine should not be adminis -\ntered when a contraindication is present. Whether and when to administer DTaP to chil -\ndren with proven or suspected underlying neurologic disorders should be decided on a  \ncase-by-case basis.\n2. Hepatitis B vaccination should be deferred for preterm infants and infants weighing less than \n2000 g if the mother is documented to be hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative at \nthe time of the infant\u2019s birth. Vaccination can commence at chronological age 1 month or at \nhospital discharge. For infants born to women who are HBsAg-positive, hepatitis B immuno -\nglobulin and hepatitis B vaccine should be administered within 12 hours of birth, regardless \nof weight.\n3.  For details, see CDC. \u201cPrevention of Rotavirus Gastroenteritis among Infants and Children: \nRecommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. (ACIP)\u201d MMWR  \n2009;58(No. RR\u20132), available at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm.\n4. LAIV, MMR, varicella, and zoster vaccines can be administered on the same day. If not \nadministered on the same day, these live vaccines should be separated by at least 28 days.5.  Immunosuppressive steroid dose is considered to be 2 or more weeks of daily receipt of \n20 mg prednisone or equivalent. Vaccination should be deferred for at least 1 month after \ndiscontinuation of such therapy. Providers should consult ACIP recommendations for com -\nplete information on the use of specific live vaccines among persons on immune-suppressing \nmedications or with immune suppression because of other reasons.\n6. HIV-infected children may receive varicella and measles vaccine if CD4+ T-lymphocyte count \nis >15%. (Source: Adapted from American Academy of Pediatrics. Immunization in Special \nClinical Circumstances. In: Pickering LK, ed.  Red Book: 2012 Report of the Committee on \nInfectious Diseases. 29th ed.

Vaccine should be deferred for the appropriate interval if replacement immune globu -\nlin products are being administered (see \u201cGeneral Recommendations on Immunization: \nRecommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)\u201d MMWR  \n2011;60(No. RR-2) available at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm.)\n8. Measles vaccination might suppress tuberculin reactivity temporarily. Measles-containing \nvaccine may be administered on the same day as tuberculin skin testing. If testing cannot be \nperformed until after the day of MMR vaccination, the test should be postponed for at least 4 \nweeks after the vaccination. If an urgent need exists to skin test, do so with the understand -\ning that reactivity might be reduced by the vaccine.\n9.

If you answer \u201cyes\u201d to any question, it does not necessarily mean your child should not be \nvaccinated. It just means additional questions must be asked. If a question is not  \nclear, please ask your healthcare provider to explain it.\n1. Is the child sick today? \uf0a3 \uf0a3 \uf0a3\n2. Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? \uf0a3 \uf0a3 \uf0a3\n3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? \uf0a3 \uf0a3 \uf0a3\n4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kidney or metabolic disease  \n(e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood disorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy?  \uf0a3 \uf0a3 \uf0a3\n5. If the child to be vaccinated is between the ages of 2 and 4 years, has a healthcare  \nprovider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? \uf0a3 \uf0a3 \uf0a3\n6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told he or she has had intussusception? \uf0a3 \uf0a3 \uf0a3\n7.

Keep it in a safe place and bring it with you every time you seek medical \ncare for your child. Your child will need this document to enter day care or school, for employment, or for international travel. Form completed by:  ___________________________________________     Date: _________________\n Form reviewed by:   ___________________________________________     Date: _________________  \nTechnical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionoccurred within 6 weeks of a prior influenza vaccination, vaccinate with TIV if at high \nrisk for severe influenza complications.\n8.  Does the child have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any \nother immune system problem? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, RV, VAR]  \nLive virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, MMRV, varicella, rotavirus, and the intranasal live, at -\ntenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV]) are usually contraindicated in immunocompromised \nchildren. However, there are exceptions. For example, MMR is recommended for \nasymptomatic HIV-infected children who do not have evidence of severe immunosup -\npression. Likewise, varicella vaccine should be considered for HIV-infected children \nwith age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage at 15% or greater and may be \nconsidered for children age 8 years and older with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of \ngreater than or equal to 200 cells/\u00b5L. Immunosuppressed children should not receive \nLAIV. Infants who have been diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency \n(SCID) should not be given a live virus vaccine, including rotavirus (RV) vaccine. For \ndetails, consult the ACIP recommendations (4, 5, 6).\n9. In the past 3 months, has the child taken medications that \nweaken their immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, \nother steroids, or anticancer drugs, or had radiation treat -\nments? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, VAR]\nLive virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, MMRV, varicella, LAIV) should be postponed until after \nchemotherapy or long-term high-dose steroid therapy has ended. For details and length \nof time to postpone, consult the ACIP statement (1). To find specific vaccination schedules \nfor stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant) patients, see reference 7. LAIV can be \ngiven only to healthy non-pregnant individuals age 2\u201349 years.\n10. In the past year, has the child received a transfusion of \nblood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) \nglobulin or an antiviral drug? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, VAR]\nCertain live virus vaccines (e.g., LAIV, MMR, MMRV, varicella) may need to be deferred, \ndepending on several variables. Consult the most current ACIP recommendations or the cur -\nrent Red Book for the most current information on intervals between antiviral drugs, immune \nglobulin or blood product administration and live virus vaccines (1, 2).\n11. Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she could \nbecome pregnant during the next month? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, VAR]\nLive virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, MMRV, varicella, LAIV) are contraindicated one month \nbefore and during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of virus transmission to the \nfetus (1, 6). Sexually active young women who receive a live virus vaccine should be \ninstructed to practice careful contraception for one month following receipt of the vac -\ncine (5, 8). On theoretical grounds, inactivated poliovirus vaccine should not be given \nduring pregnancy; however, it may be given if risk of disease is imminent (e.g., travel to \nendemic areas) and immediate protection is needed. Use of Td or Tdap is not contra -\nindicated in pregnancy. At the provider\u2019s discretion, either vaccine may be administered \nduring the 2nd or 3rd trimester (9).\n12. Has the child received vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? \n[LAIV, MMR, MMRV, VAR, yellow fever]\nIf the child was given either live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or an injectable \nlive virus vaccine (e.g., MMR, MMRV, varicella, yellow fever) in the past 4 weeks, they \nshould wait 28 days before receiving another vaccination of this type. Inactivated vac -\ncines may be given at the same time or at any spacing interval.\nReferences:\n1. CDC. General recommendations on immunization, at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm.\n2. AAP.

If so, read the information below. If you  \nwant to find out even more, consult the references listed at the bottom of this page.\nImmunization Action Coalition  \u2022  Item #P4060  \u2022  p. 2  1. Is the child sick today? [all vaccines]\nThere is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine \nadverse events (1, 2).  However, as a precaution with moderate or severe acute ill -\nness, all vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved. Mild illnesses (such \nas otitis media, upper respiratory infections, and diarrhea) are NOT contraindications \nto vaccination. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics.\n2. Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a  \nvaccine component, or latex? [all vaccines]\nIf a person reports they have an allergy to egg, ask if they can eat lightly cooked eggs \n(e.g., scrambled eggs). If they can, trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) may be admin -\nistered. If after eating eggs or egg-containing foods, they have a reaction consisting \nof only hives, TIV may be given and the person should be observed for at least 30 \nminutes. If a person experiences a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction (e.g., \nhives and either swelling of the lips or tongue, acute respiratory distress, or collapse) \nafter eating eggs, do not administer TIV or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). It \nis possible that they may be eligible to be given TIV, but only after they have seen a \nphysician with expertise in the management of allergic conditions. If a person has ana -\nphylaxis after eating gelatin, do not administer LAIV, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), \nMMR+varicella (MMRV), or varicella vaccine. A local reaction is not a contraindication. \nFor a table of vaccines supplied in vials or syringes that contain latex, go to www.cdc.\ngov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/latex-table.pdf. For an extensive \ntable of vaccine components, see reference 3. \n3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? \n[all vaccines]  History of anaphylactic reaction (see question 2) to a previous dose of \nvaccine or vaccine component is a contraindication for subsequent doses (1). His -\ntory of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP is a contraindication for \nfurther doses of pertussis-containing vaccine. Precautions to DTaP (not Tdap) include \nthe following: (a) seizure within 3 days of a dose, (b) pale or limp episode or collapse \nwithin 48 hours of a dose, (c) continuous crying for 3 or more hours within 48 hours \nof a dose, and (d) fever of 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) within 48 hours of a previous dose. There \nare other adverse events that might have occurred following vaccination that constitute \ncontraindications or precautions to future doses. Under normal circumstances, vac -\ncines are deferred when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise when \nthe benefit outweighs the risk (e.g., during a community pertussis outbreak).\n4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kid -\nney, or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood \ndisorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? [LAIV]\nChildren with any of the health conditions listed above should not be given the intrana -\nsal, live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). These children should be vaccinated with \nthe injectable influenza vaccine.\n5. If the child to be vaccinated is between the ages of 2 and \n4 years, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had \nwheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? [LAIV]\nChildren who have had a wheezing episode within the past 12 months should not be \ngiven the live attenuated influenza vaccine. Instead, these children should be given the \ninactivated influenza vaccine.\n6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told that he or \nshe has had intussusception? [Rotavirus]\nInfants who have a history of intussusception (i.e., the telescoping of one portion of the \nintestine into another) should not be given rotavirus vaccine. \n7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the \nchild had brain or other nervous system problem? [DTaP, Td, Tdap, \nTIV, LAIV, MMRV] DTaP and Tdap are contraindicated in children who have a history of \nencephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP. An unstable progressive neuro -\nlogic problem is a precaution to the use of DTaP and Tdap. For children with stable \nneurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for children with \na family history of seizures, vaccinate as usual ( exception:  children with a personal or \nfamily [i.e., parent or sibling] history of seizures generally should not be vaccinated \nwith MMRV; they should receive separate MMR and VAR vaccines). A history of \nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a consideration with the following: 1) Td/Tdap: if \nGBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a tetanus-containing vaccine and decision is made \nto continue vaccination, give age-appropriate Tdap instead of Td if no history of prior \nTdap, to improve pertussis protection; 2) Influenza vaccine (TIV or LAIV): if GBS has 1.\t \u00bfEst\u00e1\tenfermo\thoy\tel\tni\u00f1o?\t \uf0a3\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\n2.\t \u00bfEs\tal\u00e9rgico\tel\tni\u00f1o\ta\talg\u00fan\tmedicamento,\talimento,\ta\talg\u00fan\tcomponente\tde\tlas\t \t\nvacunas\to\tal\tl\u00e1tex?\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\n3.\t \u00bfT uvo\talguna\tvez\tel\tni\u00f1o\talguna\treacci\u00f3n\tseria\ta\tuna\tvacuna\ten\tel\tpasado?\t \uf0a3\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\n4.\t \u00bfHa\ttenido\tel\tni\u00f1o\talg\u00fan\tproblema\tde\tsalud\tcomo\tenfermedad\tde\tlos\tpulmones,\t \t\ndel\tcoraz\u00f3n,\tde\tlos\tri\u00f1ones\to\tmetab\u00f3lica\t(como\tdiabetes),\tasma\to\tun\ttrastorno\t \t\nde\tla\tsangre?\t\u00bfEst\u00e1\ten\tterapia\tde\taspirina\ta\tlargo\tplazo?\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\n5.\t Si\tel\tni\u00f1o\tque\tva\ta\tser\tvacunado\ttiene\tentre\t2\ty\t4\ta\u00f1os\tde\tedad,\t\u00bfle\tdijo\talg\u00fan\t \t\nprofesional\tde\tla\tsalud\ten\tlos\t\u00faltimos\t12\tmeses\tque\tel\tni\u00f1o\ttuvo\tsibilancias\to\tasma?\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\n6.\t Si\tel\tni\u00f1o\tes\tbeb\u00e9,\t\u00bfle\tdijeron\talguna\tvez\tque\ttuvo\tintususcepci\u00f3n?\t \uf0a3\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\n7.\t \u00bfEl\tni\u00f1o,\tuno\tde\tsus\thermanos\to\tpadres,\tha\ttenido\tconvulsiones;\tha\ttenido\tel\tni\u00f1o\t \t\nproblemas\tdel\tcerebro\to\talg\u00fan\totro\tproblema\tdel\tsistema\tnervioso?\t\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\n8.\t\u00bfTiene \tel\tni\u00f1o\tc\u00e1ncer, \tleucemia, \tVIH/SIDA \to\talg\u00fan \totro\tproblema \tdel\tsistema \tinmunol\u00f3gico? \t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\n9.\t En\tlos\t\u00faltimos\t3\tmeses,\t\u00bfha\ttomado\tel\tni\u00f1o\tmedicamento\tque\tdebiliten\tsu\tsistema\t \t\ninmunol\u00f3gico,\ttales\tcomo\tcortisona,\tprednisona,\totros\testeroides\to\tmedicamentos \t\ncontra\tel\tc\u00e1ncer,\to\tle\than\thecho\ttratamientos\tde\tradiaci\u00f3n?\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\n10.\t Durante\tel\ta\u00f1o\tpasado,\t\u00bfle\thicieron\tal\tni\u00f1o\tuna\ttransfusi\u00f3n\tde\tsangre\to\tde\tproductos\tde\t \t\nla\tsangre,\to\tle\tdieron\tinmunoglobulina\to\tgamaglobulina\to\talg\u00fan\tmedicamento\tantiviral?\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\n11.\t \u00bfEst\u00e1\tla\tni\u00f1a/adolescente\tembarazada\to\thay\talguna\tposibilidad\tde\tque\tquede\t \t\nembarazada\tdurante\tel\tpr\u00f3ximo\tmes? \t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\n12.\t \u00bfLe\taplicaron\talguna\tvacuna\tal\tni\u00f1o\ten\tlas\t\u00faltimas\t4\tsemanas?\t \uf0a3\t\uf0a3\t\uf0a3\nImmunization\tAction\tCoalition\t\u2022\t1573\tSelby\tAve.\t\u2022\tSt.\tPaul,\tMN\t55104\t\u2022\t(651)\t647-9009 \t\u2022\twww.immunize.org\t\u2022\twww.vaccineinformation.orgwww.immunize.org/catg.d/p4060-01.pdf\t\u2022\tItem\t#P4060-01\tSpanish\t(10/12)Cuestionario de contraindicaciones  \npara vacunaci\u00f3n de ni\u00f1os y adolescentes \nA los padres/tutores: Las\tsiguientes\tpreguntas\tnos\tayudar\u00e1n\ta\tdeterminar\tcu\u00e1les\tvacunas\tle\tpodremos\t\ndar\thoy\ta\tsu\thijo.\tSi\tcontesta\t\u201cs\u00ed\u201d\ta\talguna\tpregunta,\teso\tno\tsiempre\tquiere\tdecir\tque\tno\tdeben\tvacunar\ta\tsu\t\nhijo.\tSimplemente\tquiere\tdecir\tque\thay\tque\thacerle\tm\u00e1s\tpreguntas.\tSi\talguna\tpregunta\tno\test\u00e1\tclara,\tpida\ta\tsu\t\nprofesional\tde\tla\tsalud\tque\tse\tla\texplique.\nNo S\u00ed No sabeNombre\tdel\tpaciente:\t \tFecha\tde\tnacimiento:\t \t/ \t/\n\t (mes)\t (d\u00eda)\t (a\u00f1o)\nFormulario\tllenado\tpor:\t \t\t\t\tFecha:\t\nFormulario\trevisado\tpor:\t \t\t\t\tFecha:\t\n\u00bfT rajo el comprobante de vacunaci\u00f3n de su hijo? \t s\u00ed\t\uf0a3\t no\t\uf0a3\nEs\timportante\t que\t tenga\t un\tcomprobante\t de\tvacunaci\u00f3n\t personal\t de\tlas\tvacunas\t de\tsu\thijo.\t Si\tno\tlo\ttiene,\t p\u00eddale\t al\tprofesional\t de\tla\t\nsalud\t de\tsu\thijo\tque\t le\td\u00e9\tuno\t con\ttodas\t las\tvacunas\t de\ta\tsu\thijo.\t Gu\u00e1rdelo\t en\tun\tlugar\t seguro\t y\tll\u00e9velo\t todas\t las\tveces\t que\t su\thijo\t\nreciba\t atenci\u00f3n\t m\u00e9dica.\t Su\thijo\tnecesitar\u00e1\t este\t documento\t importante\t por\tel\tresto\t de\tsu\tvida\tpara\t ingresar\t a\tla\tguarder\u00eda\t o\ta\tla\tescuela,\t\npara\templeos\to\tpara\tviajar\tal\textranjero.\nT ranslation\tby\tT ranscend,\tDavis,\tCAhistory of prior Tdap; 2) Influenza vaccine (TIV or LAIV): if GBS has occurred within 6 \nweeks of a prior influenza vaccination, vaccinate with TIV if at high risk for severe influ -\nenza complications.\n8.  Does the child have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any \nother immune system problem? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, RV, VAR]  \nLive virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, MMRV, varicella, rotavirus, and the intranasal live, at -\ntenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV]) are usually contraindicated in immunocompromised \nchildren. However, there are exceptions. For example, MMR is recommended for \nasymptomatic HIV-infected children who do not have evidence of severe immunosup -\npression. Likewise, varicella vaccine should be considered for HIV-infected children \nwith age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage at 15% or greater and may be \nconsidered for children age 8 years and older with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of \ngreater than or equal to 200 cells/\u00b5L. Immunosuppressed children should not receive \nLAIV. Infants who have been diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency \n(SCID) should not be given a live virus vaccine, including rotavirus (RV) vaccine. For \ndetails, consult the ACIP recommendations (4, 5, 6).\n9. In the past 3 months, has the child taken medications that \nweaken their immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, \nother steroids, or anticancer drugs, or had radiation treat -\nments? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, VAR]\nLive virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, MMRV, varicella, LAIV) should be postponed until after \nchemotherapy or long-term high-dose steroid therapy has ended. For details and length \nof time to postpone, consult the ACIP statement (1). To find specific vaccination schedules \nfor stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant) patients, see reference 7. LAIV can be \ngiven only to healthy non-pregnant individuals age 2\u201349 years.\n10. In the past year, has the child received a transfusion of \nblood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) \nglobulin or an antiviral drug? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, VAR]\nCertain live virus vaccines (e.g., LAIV, MMR, MMRV, varicella) may need to be deferred, \ndepending on several variables. Consult the most current ACIP recommendations or the cur -\nrent Red Book for the most current information on intervals between antiviral drugs, immune \nglobulin or blood product administration and live virus vaccines (1, 2).\n11. Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she could \nbecome pregnant during the next month? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, VAR]\nLive virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, MMRV, varicella, LAIV) are contraindicated one month \nbefore and during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of virus transmission to the \nfetus (1, 6). Sexually active young women who receive a live virus vaccine should be \ninstructed to practice careful contraception for one month following receipt of the vac -\ncine (5, 8). On theoretical grounds, inactivated poliovirus vaccine should not be given \nduring pregnancy; however, it may be given if risk of disease is imminent (e.g., travel to \nendemic areas) and immediate protection is needed. Use of Td or Tdap is not contra -\nindicated in pregnancy. At the provider\u2019s discretion, either vaccine may be administered \nduring the 2nd or 3rd trimester (9).\n12. Has the child received vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? \n[LAIV, MMR, MMRV, VAR, yellow fever]\nIf the child was given either live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or an injectable \nlive virus vaccine (e.g., MMR, MMRV, varicella, yellow fever) in the past 4 weeks, they \nshould wait 28 days before receiving another vaccination of this type. Inactivated vac -\ncines may be given at the same time or at any spacing interval.\nReferences:\n1. CDC. General recommendations on immunization, at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm.\n2. AAP.

[all vaccines]\nThere is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine \nadverse events (1, 2).  However, as a precaution with moderate or severe acute ill -\nness, all vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved. Mild illnesses (such \nas otitis media, upper respiratory infections, and diarrhea) are NOT contraindications \nto vaccination. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics.\n2. Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a  \nvaccine component, or latex? [all vaccines]\nIf a person reports they have an allergy to egg, ask if they can eat lightly cooked eggs \n(e.g., scrambled eggs). If they can, trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) may be admin -\nistered. If after eating eggs or egg-containing foods, they have a reaction consisting \nof only hives, TIV may be given and the person should be observed for at least 30 \nminutes. If a person experiences a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction (e.g., \nhives and either swelling of the lips or tongue, acute respiratory distress, or collapse) \nafter eating eggs, do not administer TIV or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). It \nis possible that they may be eligible to be given TIV, but only after they have seen a \nphysician with expertise in the management of allergic conditions. If a person has ana -\nphylaxis after eating gelatin, do not administer LAIV, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), \nMMR+varicella (MMRV), or varicella vaccine. A local reaction is not a contraindication. \nFor a table of vaccines supplied in vials or syringes that contain latex, go to www.cdc.\ngov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/latex-table.pdf. For an extensive \ntable of vaccine components, see reference 3. \n3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? \n[all vaccines]  History of anaphylactic reaction (see question 2) to a previous dose of \nvaccine or vaccine component is a contraindication for subsequent doses (1). His -\ntory of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP is a contraindication for \nfurther doses of pertussis-containing vaccine. Precautions to DTaP (not Tdap) include \nthe following: (a) seizure within 3 days of a dose, (b) pale or limp episode or collapse \nwithin 48 hours of a dose, (c) continuous crying for 3 or more hours within 48 hours \nof a dose, and (d) fever of 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) within 48 hours of a previous dose. There \nare other adverse events that might have occurred following vaccination that constitute \ncontraindications or precautions to future doses. Under normal circumstances, vac -\ncines are deferred when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise when \nthe benefit outweighs the risk (e.g., during a community pertussis outbreak).\n4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kid -\nney, or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood \ndisorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? [LAIV]\nChildren with any of the health conditions listed above should not be given the intrana -\nsal, live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). These children should be vaccinated with \nthe injectable influenza vaccine.\n5. If the child to be vaccinated is between the ages of 2 and \n4 years, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had \nwheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? [LAIV]\nChildren who have had a wheezing episode within the past 12 months should not be \ngiven the live attenuated influenza vaccine. Instead, these children should be given the \ninactivated influenza vaccine.\n6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told that he or \nshe has had intussusception? [Rotavirus]\nInfants who have a history of intussusception (i.e., the telescoping of one portion of the \nintestine into another) should not be given rotavirus vaccine. \n7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the \nchild had brain or other nervous system problem? [DTaP, Td, Tdap, \nTIV, LAIV, MMRV] DTaP and Tdap are contraindicated in children who have a history of \nencephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP. An unstable progressive neurolog -\nic problem is a precaution to the use of DTaP and Tdap, and a progressive neurologic \ndisorder in a teen is a precaution to the use of Td. For children with stable neurologic \ndisorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for children with a family \nhistory of seizures, vaccinate as usual ( exception:  children with a personal or family [i.e., \nparent or sibling] history of seizures generally should not be vaccinated with MMRV; \nthey should receive separate MMR and VAR vaccines). A history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syn -\ndrome (GBS) is a consideration with the following:  \n1) Td/Tdap: if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a tetanus-containing vaccine and \ndecision is made to continue vaccination, give age-appropriate Tdap instead of Td if no 1.

Check the package inserts at www.immunize.org/\npackageinserts for information on which vaccines are affected, \nor go to  www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/\nappendices/B/latex-table.pdf.\n3. Has the person to be vaccinated ever had a seri -\nous reaction to influenza vaccine in the past?\nPatients reporting a serious reaction to a previous dose of \ninactivated influenza vaccine should be asked to describe \ntheir symptoms. Immediate\u2014presumably allergic\u2014reactions \nare usually a contraindication to further vaccination against \ninfluenza. \nFever, malaise, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms most \noften affect people who are first-time vaccinees. These mild-\nto-moderate local reactions are not a contraindication to \nfuture vaccination. Also, red eyes or mild upper facial swelling \nfollowing vaccination with inactivated injectable influenza \nvaccine is most likely a coincidental event and not related \nto the vaccine; these people can receive injectable vaccine \nwithout further evaluation.\n4. Has the person to be vaccinated ever had  \nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome?  \nIt is prudent to avoid vaccinating people who are not at high \nrisk for severe influenza complications (see source 3) but who \nare known to have developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) \nwithin 6 weeks after receiving a previous influenza vaccination. \nAs an alternative, physicians might consider using influenza \nantiviral chemoprophylaxis for these people. Although data are \nlimited, the established benefits of influenza vaccination for the \nmajority of people who have a history of GBS, and who are at \nhigh risk for severe complications from influenza, justify yearly \nvaccination. 1. Is the person to be vaccinated sick today?\nThere is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy \nor increases vaccine adverse events. People with an acute \nfebrile illness usually should not be vaccinated until their symp -\ntoms have improved. Minor illnesses with or without fever do \nnot contraindicate use of influenza vaccine. Do not withhold \nvaccination if a person is taking antibiotics.\n2. Does the person to be vaccinated have an  \nallergy to eggs or to a component of the vaccine?\nAllergic reactions to any vaccine component can occur. The  \nmajority of reactions probably are caused by residual egg protein. \nAlthough most current influenza vaccines contain only a limited \nquantity of egg protein, this protein can induce immediate allergic \nreactions among people who have severe egg allergy. \nAn egg-free recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine (RIV) may be \nused in people age 18 through 49 years with egg allergy of any \nseverity who have no other contraindications. People who do \nnot meet the age criteria for RIV who have experienced a seri -\nous systemic or anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives, swelling of the \nlips or tongue, acute respiratory distress, or collapse) after eat -\ning eggs should consult a specialist for appropriate evaluation to \nhelp determine if vaccine should be administered. People who \nhave documented immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hyper -\nsensitivity to eggs, including those who have had occupational \nasthma or other allergic responses to egg protein, might also \nbe at increased risk for allergic reactions to influenza vaccine. \nProtocols have been published for safely administering influenza \nvaccine to people with egg allergies (see source 3). \nSome people who report allergy to egg might not be egg-\nallergic. If a person can eat lightly cooked eggs (e.g., scrambled \neggs), they are unlikely to have an egg allergy. However, peo -\nple who can tolerate egg in baked products (e.g., cake) might \nstill have an egg allergy. If the person develops hives only after \ningesting eggs, CDC recommends they receive either inactivat -\ned influenza vaccine (IIV) or, if age-eligible, RIV (not LAIV). If IIV \nis to be administered, CDC further recommends 1) the vaccine \nbe administered by a healthcare provider familiar with the po -\ntential manifestations of egg allergy and 2) the vaccine recipient \nbe observed for at least 30 minutes after receipt of the vaccine \nfor signs of a reaction. \nFluzone (sanofi pasteur) contains gelatin as a stabilizer; therefore \na history of anaphylactic reaction to gelatin is a contraindication. \nSome inactivated influenza vaccines contain thimerosal as a pre -\nservative. Most people who had sensitivity to thimerosal when \nit was used in contact lens solution do not have reactions to thi -Information for Health Professionals about the Screening Checklist for Contraindications \nto Inactivated Injectable Influenza Vaccination\nAre you interested in knowing why we included a certain question on the screening checklist?

Has the person to be vaccinated ever had a seri -\nous reaction to influenza vaccine in the past?\nPatients reporting a serious reaction to a previous dose of \ninactivated influenza vaccine should be asked to describe \ntheir symptoms. Immediate\u2014presumably allergic\u2014reactions \nare usually a contraindication to further vaccination against \ninfluenza. \nFever, malaise, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms most \noften affect people who are first-time vaccinees. These mild-\nto-moderate local reactions are not a contraindication to \nfuture vaccination. Also, red eyes or mild upper facial swelling \nfollowing vaccination with inactivated injectable influenza \nvaccine is most likely a coincidental event and not related \nto the vaccine; these people can receive injectable vaccine \nwithout further evaluation.\n4. Has the person to be vaccinated ever had  \nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome?  \nIt is prudent to avoid vaccinating people who are not at high \nrisk for severe influenza complications (see source 3) but who \nare known to have developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) \nwithin 6 weeks after receiving a previous influenza vaccination. \nAs an alternative, physicians might consider using influenza \nantiviral chemoprophylaxis for these people. Although data are \nlimited, the established benefits of influenza vaccination for the \nmajority of people who have a history of GBS, and who are at \nhigh risk for severe complications from influenza, justify yearly \nvaccination. 1. Is the person to be vaccinated sick today?\nThere is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy \nor increases vaccine adverse events. People with an acute \nfebrile illness usually should not be vaccinated until their symp -\ntoms have improved. Minor illnesses with or without fever do \nnot contraindicate use of influenza vaccine. Do not withhold \nvaccination if a person is taking antibiotics.\n2. Does the person to be vaccinated have an  \nallergy to eggs or to a component of the vaccine?\nAllergic reactions to any vaccine component can occur. The  \nmajority of reactions probably are caused by residual egg protein. \nAlthough most current influenza vaccines contain only a limited \nquantity of egg protein, this protein can induce immediate allergic \nreactions among people who have severe egg allergy. \nAn egg-free recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine (RIV) may be \nused in people age 18 through 49 years with egg allergy of any \nseverity who have no other contraindications. People who do \nnot meet the age criteria for RIV who have experienced a seri -\nous systemic or anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives, swelling of the \nlips or tongue, acute respiratory distress, or collapse) after eat -\ning eggs should consult a specialist for appropriate evaluation to \nhelp determine if vaccine should be administered. People who \nhave documented immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hyper -\nsensitivity to eggs, including those who have had occupational \nasthma or other allergic responses to egg protein, might also \nbe at increased risk for allergic reactions to influenza vaccine. \nProtocols have been published for safely administering influenza \nvaccine to people with egg allergies (see source 3). \nSome people who report allergy to egg might not be egg-\nallergic. If a person can eat lightly cooked eggs (e.g., scrambled \neggs), they are unlikely to have an egg allergy. However, peo -\nple who can tolerate egg in baked products (e.g., cake) might \nstill have an egg allergy. If the person develops hives only after \ningesting eggs, CDC recommends they receive either inactivat -\ned influenza vaccine (IIV) or, if age-eligible, RIV (not LAIV). If IIV \nis to be administered, CDC further recommends 1) the vaccine \nbe administered by a healthcare provider familiar with the po -\ntential manifestations of egg allergy and 2) the vaccine recipient \nbe observed for at least 30 minutes after receipt of the vaccine \nfor signs of a reaction. \nFluzone (sanofi pasteur) contains gelatin as a stabilizer; therefore \na history of anaphylactic reaction to gelatin is a contraindication. \nSome inactivated influenza vaccines contain thimerosal as a pre -\nservative.

Is the person to be vaccinated receiving antiviral medications?  \nReceipt of certain influenza antivirals (e.g., amantadine, rimantadine, zana -\nmivir, oseltamivir) could reduce LAIV vaccine efficacy; therefore, providers \nmay want to defer vaccination with LAIV in people who took these antivirals \nwithin the previous 48 hours and to advise avoiding use of these antivirals for \n14 days after vaccination, if feasible.\n9. Is the child or teen to be vaccinated receiving aspirin thera -\npy or aspirin-containing therapy?\nBecause of the theoretical risk of Reye\u2019s syndrome, children and teens on \naspirin therapy should not be given LAIV.

The schedule is\nevaluated each year based on the most recent scientific data available . Changes are\nannounced in January, if needed. The schedule is approved by the American Academy of\nPediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of\nFamily Physicians.\nQ2: How are the timing and spacing of the shots determined?\nA: Each vaccine dose is scheduled using 2 factors. First, it is scheduled for the age when the\nbody\u2019s immune system will work the be st. Second, it is balanced with the need to provide\nprotection to infants and children at the earliest possible age.\nQ3: Why are there so many doses?\nA:Researchers are always studying how well vaccines work. For many vaccines three or four\ndoses areneeded to full yprotect your child. The doses need tobe spaced out a certain\namount to work the best.\nQ4: Why is the schedule \u201cone size fits all?\u201d Aren\u2019t there some children who\nshouldn\u2019t receive some vaccines?\nA:Your child\u2019s health and safety are very important to your child\u2019s doctor. The schedule is\nconsidered the ideal schedule for healthy children but there may be exceptions. For example,\nyour child might not receive certain vaccines if she has allergies to aningredient in the\nvaccine, or if she ha sa weakened immune system due to illness, a chronic condition, or\nanother medical treatment. Sometimes a shot needs to be delayed for a short time, and\nsometimes not given at all .\nYour pediatrician stays updated about newexceptions to the immunization schedule. This is\none reason your child\u2019s complete medical history is taken at the pediatrician\u2019s office, and why\nit is important for your child\u2019s health care providers to be familiar with your child\u2019s medical\nhistory.\nQ5: Why can\u2019t the shots be spread out over a longer period of time? There are 25\nshots recommended in the first 15 months of life; wh ynotspread th eseout over 2 or 3\nyears?\nA: First, you would not want your child to go unprotected that long. Babies are hospitalized\nand die more often from some diseases, so it is important to vaccinate them as soon as it is\nsafe. Second, the recommended schedule is designed towork best with a child\u2019s immune\nsystem at certain ages and at specific times . There is no research to show that a child would\nbeequally protected against diseases with a very different schedule . Also, there is noscientific reason why spreading out the shots would be safer. But we do know that any\nlength of time without immunizations is a time without protection.\nQ6: I\u2019ve seen another schedule in a magazine that allows the shots to be spread out.\nIt was developed by a pediatrician. Why can\u2019t I follow that schedule? My child would\nstill get his immunizations in time for school.\nA: There is no scientific basis for such a schedule . No one knows how well it would work to\nprotect your child from diseases . And if many parents in any community decided to follow\nsuch a schedule, diseases will be able to spread much more quickly .Also, people who are too\nsick or too young to receive vacc inesareplaced at risk when they are around unvaccinated\nchildren.\nFor example, following one alternative schedule would leave children without full polio\nprotection until age 4. Yet it would take only one case of polio to be brought into the U.S.\nfor the disease to take hold again in this country. This schedule also delays the measles\nvaccine until age 3. We have already seen outbreaks of measles in some parts of the country\nbecause children were not immunized .This is a highly infectious disease that c ancause\nserious harm --even de ath. The reason we recommend vaccines when we do is because young\nchildren are more vulnerable to these diseases.\nPediatricians want parents to have reliable, complete, and science -based information, so that\nthey can make the best decision for their child about vaccination.\nQ7: Isn\u2019t it possible that my child has natural immunity to one or more diseases? If\nhe does, can\u2019t he skip the shot?\nA:Tests thatcheck for immunity to certain diseases do not work well in young chi ldren .\nQ8: Isn\u2019t it overwhelming to a child\u2019s immune system to give so many shots in one\nvisit?\nA:Infants and children are exposed to many germs every day just by playing, eating, and\nbreathing. Their immune systems fight those germs, also called anti gens, to keep the body\nhealthy. The amount of antigens that children fight every day is much more than the\nantigens in any combination of vaccines on the current schedule. So children\u2019s immune\nsystems are not overwhelmed by vaccines.\nQ9: There are no sho ts given at 9 months, other than maybe flu vaccine or catch -up\nvaccines. W hynotgive some at that visit instead of at 6 months or 12 months?\nA: Waiting until 9 months would leave the child unprotected from some diseases , but 9\nmonths is too early for some of the12-18 month vaccines .For example, i t is too early for\nthe live measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines ,since some infants might have a bit\nofprotection left from their mother during the pregnancy, and that protection could make\nthe vacc ine less effective .\nThe information contained in this publication should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your\npediatrician. There may be variations in treatment that your pediatrician may recommend based on individual facts and\ncircumstances.\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Pediatrics, October 2008 \nQuestions and Answers about Vaccine Ingredients  \nQ. What ingredients are in vaccines?  \nA. All vaccines contain antigens.  Antigens make vaccines  work. They  prompt the body to create  the immune \nresponse needed to protect against infection.  Antigens come in several f orms. The form used in a vaccine is chosen \nbecause studies show it is the best way to protect against a particular infection. \n Antigen  forms include:   \n\u2022 Weakened live viruses. They are too weak to cause disease but can still prompt and immune response. \nMeasles, mumps, rubella, rotavirus, chickenpox, and one type of influenza vaccines contain weakened live viruses.  \n\u2022 Inactivated (or killed) viruses. These viruses cannot cause even a mild form of the disease, but the body still recognizes the virus and creates and immune response to protect itself. In the United States, t he polio, \nhepatitis A, influenza and rabies vaccines contain inactivated v iruses.  \n\u2022 Partial viruses. These are made up of the specific part of the dead virus that will prompt a protective immune response.  Some vaccines are made this way including the hepatitis B and HPV vaccines.  \n\u2022 Partial bacteria. These are made up of the specifi c part of the dead bacteria that will prompt a protective \nimmune response.  Some vaccines are made this way including the Hib, pneumococcal , meningococcal , \ndiphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccines.   \nVaccines also contain other  ingredients , which help make them safer and more effective. They include:  \n\u2022 Preservatives . They keep the vials from getting contaminated with germs.  \n\u2022 Adjuvants.  They help the body create a better immune response. These are aluminum salts . \n\u2022 Additives.  They help the vaccine stay effective while being stored. Additives include gelatin, albumin, \nsucrose, lactose, MSG, and glycine. \n\u2022 Residuals of the vaccine production process. Some ingredients are needed to make the vaccine. Although \nthese ingredients are removed, tiny (resi dual) amounts are left in the final product. Depending on how the \nvaccine is made, it may include tiny amounts of antibiotics (neomycin), egg protein, or yeast protein.  \nQ. Are these other ingredients in vaccines safe?  \nA. Yes.  \n \nQ. Why are these other ingred ients in vaccines?   \nA. Each ingredient has a specific function in a vaccine. These ingredients have been studied and are safe for humans \nin the amount used in vaccines. This amount is much less than children encounter in their environment, food and \nwater.   \n \n\u2022 Aluminum salts. Aluminum salts help your body create a better immune response to vaccines. Aluminum salts are necessary to make some of the vaccines we use more effective. Without an adjuvant like aluminum, people could need more doses of shots to be protected. Everyone is exposed to aluminum because there is \nmuch aluminum in the earth\u2019s crust. It\u2019s present in our food, air and water, including breast milk and \nformula. The amount of aluminum in vaccines is similar to that found in 33 ounces of infant form ula. \nAluminum has been used and studied in vaccines for 75 years and is safe.  \n   \u2022 Formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is used to detoxify diphtheria and tetanus toxins or to inactivate a virus. The \ntiny amount which may be left in these vaccines is safe. Vaccines ar e not the only source of formaldehyde \nyour baby is exposed to. Formaldehyde is also in products like paper towels, mascara and carpeting. Our \nbodies normally have formaldehyde in the blood stream and at levels higher than in vaccines . \n\u2022 Antibiotics. Antibiot ics, such as neomycin, are present in some vaccines to prevent  bacterial contamination \nwhen the vaccine is made. Trace amounts of antibiotics in  vaccines rarely, if ever, cause allergic reactions.  \n\u2022 Egg protein. Influenza and yellow fever vaccines are produc ed in eggs, so egg proteins are present in the \nfinal product and can cause allergic reaction . Measles and  mumps vaccines are made in chick embryo cells in \nculture, not in eggs. The much smaller amount of remaining egg proteins found in the MMR (measles, mumps,  rubella) vaccine does not usually cause a reaction in egg allergic children.  \n\u2022 Gelatin. Some vaccines contain gelatin to protect them against freeze-drying or heat. People with severe allergies to gelatin should avoid getting gelatin -containing  vaccines . \n \nQ. Do vaccines contain antifreeze?  \nA: No. Antifreeze is typically made of ethylene glycol, which is unsafe. Confusion has arisen, because p olyethylene \nglycol (a  chemical used personal care products like skin creams and toothpaste) is  used in vaccines an d is safe. It is \nused to inactivate the influenza virus in some influenza  vaccines. It is also used to purify other vaccines.  \n \nQ. Do vaccines contain mercury?  \nA: Almost all childhood vaccines do NOT contain  any mercury. Methylmercury, which is found in fis h and other \nanimals (including humans) can be toxic and lead to adverse effects in humans. Thimerosal, a mercury -based \npreservative, was removed from most childhood vaccines in 2001. Thimerosal contains a different form of mercury \ncalled ethylmercury, whic h is processed by the body very differently than methylmercury, and is not associated with \nthe same adverse effects . It is still present in some influenza vaccines. Thimerosal is still used in the manufacture  of \nsome vaccines to prevent contamination. The thimerosal is removed at the end of the  manufacturing process. In \nsome cases, a tiny amount of thimerosal remains. The remaining  amount is so small, that it is not possible for it to \nhave any effect. Valid scientific studies  have shown there is no link bet ween thimerosal and autism. In fact, autism \nrates have actually increased since thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines. The American  Academy of \nPediatrics (AAP), the American Medical Association (AMA), the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, \nand the  Institute of Medicine (IOM) agree that science does not support a link between thimerosal in vaccines and \nautism. For the IOM report, go to http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3793/4705/4717.aspx\n. \n Q. Do vaccines contain fetal tissue?  \nA. No. A  few vaccines involve growing the viruses in human cell culture. Two cell lines provide the cultures needed \nfor producing vaccines . These lines were developed from two fetuses in the 1960s . The  fetuses were ab orted for \nmedical reasons, not for the purpose of producing vaccines.  These cell lines have an indefinite life span, meaning \nthat no new aborted fetuses  are ever  used . No fetal tissue is included in the vaccines, either, so children are not \ninjected with any part of an aborted fetus.  \n \nQ. Should vaccines be \u201cgreener\u201d?  \nA. The amount of each additive used in vaccines is very small. In fact, we are exposed to  much higher levels of these \nchemicals in our everyday lives. In vaccines, these  ingredients are  used t o make the vaccine safer and more effective. \nEach vaccine is tested many times to  make sure it is safe and works. Taking ingredients out might affect the ability \nof the vaccine to protect a child. Research is always being done to make sure that the ingredi ents in vaccines \ncontinue to be the safest and best available for children.  \n \n   \nThe information contained in this publication should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your  pediatrician.

Diphtheria and pertussis\nare spread from person to person.  Tetanus enters thebody through cuts or wounds.\nDIPHTHERIA causes a thick covering in the back of  the\nthroat.\u2022 It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart\nfailure, and even death.\nTETANUS (Lockjaw)  causes painful tightening of\nthe muscles, usually all over the body.\u2022 It can lead to \u201clocking\u201d of the jaw so the victim\ncannot open his mouth or swallow.  Tetanus leadsto death in up to 2 out of 10 cases.\nPERTUSSIS (Whooping Cough)  causes coughing\nspells so bad that it is hard for infants to eat, drink,or breathe.  These spells can last for weeks.\u2022 It can lead to pneumonia, seizures (jerking and\nstaring spells), brain damage, and death.\nDiphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine\n(DTaP) can help prevent these diseases.  Most\nchildren who are vaccinated with DTaP will beprotected throughout childhood. Many more childrenwould get these diseases if we stopped vaccinating.\nDTaP is a safer version of an older vaccine called\nDTP.  DTP is no longer used in the United States.\u2022 Children with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may\nbe vaccinated.  But children who are moderatelyor severely ill should usually wait until they recoverbefore getting DTaP vaccine.\n\u2022 Any child who had a life-threatening allergic\nreaction after a dose of DTaP should not getanother dose.\n\u2022 Any child who suffered a brain or nervous system\ndisease within 7 days after a dose of DTaP shouldnot get another dose.\n\u2022 Talk with your doctor if your child:\n- had a seizure or collapsed after a dose of DTaP,- cried non-stop for 3 hours or more after a dose of\nDTaP,\n- had a fever over 105\noF after a dose of DTaP.\nAsk your health care provider for more information.\nSome of these children should not get another doseof pertussis vaccine, but may get a vaccine withoutpertussis, called DT.\nChildren  should get 5 doses of DTaP vaccine, one dose\nat each of the following ages:\n33333 2 months  3 3 3 3 3 4 months 33333 6 months\n   3   3   3   3   3 15-18 months             3 3 3 3 3 4-6 years\nDTaP may be given at the same time as other vaccines.W   H   A   T       Y   O   U       N   E   E   D       T   O       K   N   O  W\nSome children should not\nget DTaP vaccine or shouldwait3\nWho should get DTaPvaccine and when?21 Why get vaccinated?\n4 Older children and adults\nDTaP is not licensed for adolescents, adults, orchildren 7 years of age and older.\nBut older people still need protection. A vaccine\ncalled Tdap  is similar to DTaP. A single dose of\nTdap is recommended for people 11 through 64years of age. Another vaccine, called Td, protects\nagainst tetanus and diphtheria, but not pertussis. It isrecommended every 10 years. There are separateVaccine Information Statements for these vaccines.\nDiphtheria/Tetanus/Pertussis             5/17/2007Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis.In the rare event that you or your child has a serious\nreaction to a vaccine, a federal program has been createdto help pay for the care of those who have been harmed.\nFor details about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation\nProgram, call 1-800-338-2382  or visit the program\u2019s website\nat www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation.\n\u2022 Ask your health care provider.  They can give you the\nvaccine package insert or suggest other sources ofinformation.\n\u2022 Call your local or state health department\u2019s\nimmunization program.\n\u2022\nContact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\n- Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO)\n- Visit the National Immunization Program\u2019s website at\nwww.cdc.gov/vaccines\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES\nCenters for Disease Control and PreventionGetting diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis disease ismuch riskier than getting DTaP vaccine.\nHowever, a vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of\ncausing serious problems, such as severe allergicreactions. The risk of DTaP vaccine causing seriousharm, or death, is extremely small.\nMild Problems (Common)\n\u2022 Fever (up to about 1 child in 4)\u2022 Redness or swelling where the shot was given (up to\nabout 1 child in 4)\n\u2022 Soreness or tenderness where the shot was given (up\nto about 1 child in 4)\nThese problems occur more often after the 4th and 5thdoses of the DTaP series than after earlier doses.Sometimes the 4th or 5th dose of DTaP vaccine isfollowed by swelling of the entire arm or leg in whichthe shot was given, lasting 1-7 days (up to about 1child in 30).Other mild problems include:\u2022 Fussiness (up to about 1 child in 3)\u2022 Tiredness or poor appetite (up to about 1 child in 10)\u2022 Vomiting (up to about 1 child in 50)\nThese problems generally occur 1-3 days after the shot.\nModerate Problems (Uncommon)\n\u2022 Seizure (jerking or staring) (about 1 child out of\n14,000)\n\u2022 Non-stop crying, for 3 hours or more (up to about\n1 child out of 1,000)\n\u2022 High fever, over 105\noF (about 1 child out of\n16,000)\nSevere Problems (Very Rare)\n\u2022 Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million\ndoses)\n\u2022 Several other severe problems have been reported\nafter DTaP vaccine. These include:- Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness- Permanent brain damage.These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are causedby the vaccine.\nControlling fever is especially important for children\nwho have had seizures, for any reason.  It is alsoimportant if another family member has had seizures.You can reduce fever and pain by giving your child anaspirin-free  pain reliever when the shot is given, and\nfor the next 24 hours, following the packageinstructions.What should I look for?\nAny unusual conditions, such as a serious allergic reaction,\nhigh fever or unusual behavior. Serious allergic reactionsare extremely rare with any vaccine.  If one were to occur,it would most likely be within a few minutes to a fewhours after the shot.  Signs can include difficulty breathing,hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fastheart beat or dizziness. If a high fever or seizure were tooccur, it would usually be within a week after the shot.\nWhat should I do?\n\u2022Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away.\n\u2022Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it\nhappened, and when the vaccination was given.\n\u2022Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to report the\nreaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting\nSystem  (VAERS) form.\nOr you can file this report through the VAERS web site at\nwww.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967 .\nVAERS does not provide medical advice\nVaccine Information Statement\n DTaP (5/17/07)                                                   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-26What if there is a moderate\nor severe reaction?6\nThe National Vaccine Injury\nCompensation Program7\n8How can I learn more?What are the risks from\nDTaP vaccine?5\n5VACUNAS\nLa difteria, el t\u00e9tano y la tos ferina son enfermedades graves \ncausadas por bacterias.

Visite http://www.immunize.org/vis\n \n1 What is hepatitis A? \nHepatitis A is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus (HA V). HA V is found in the stool of people with hepatitis A. \nIt is usually spread by close personal contact and some\u00ad\ntimes by eating food or drinking water containing HA V . A person who has hepatitis A can easily pass the disease to others within the same household. \nHepatitis A can cause:\n \u2022 \u201c\ufb02 u-like\u201d illness \n\u2022 jaundice (yellow skin or eyes, dark urine) \u2022 severe stomach pains and diarrhea (children) \nPeople with hepatitis A often have to be hospitalized (up to about 1 person in 5). \nAdults with hepatitis A are often too ill to work for up to \na month. \nSometimes, people die as a result of hepatitis A (about \n3-6 deaths per 1,000 cases). \nHepatitis A vaccine can prevent hepatitis A. \n2 Who should get hepatitis A \nvaccine and when? \nWHO? \nSome people should be routinely vaccinated with \nhepatitis A vaccine:  \n\u2022 All children between their \ufb01 rst and second birthdays  \n (12 through 23 months of age). \n\u2022 Anyone 1 year of age and older traveling to or working \n in countries with high or intermediate prevalence of \n hepatitis A, such as those located in Central or South \n America, Mexico, Asia (except Japan), Africa, and \n eastern Europe. For more information see \n www.cdc.gov/travel. \n\u2022 Children and adolescents 2 through 18 years of age \n who live in states or communities where routine \n vaccination has been implemented because of high \n disease incidence. \n\u2022 Men who have sex with men. \u2022 People who use street drugs. \u2022 People with chronic liver disease. \n\u2022 People who are treated with clotting factor \nconcentrates. \n\u2022 People who work with HA V-infected primates or who  \nwork with HA V in research laboratories. \n\u2022 Members of households planning to adopt a child, or care for a newly arriving adopted child, from a country where hepatitis A is common. \nOther people might get hepatitis A vaccine in certain situations (ask your doctor for more details): \n\u2022 Unvaccinated children or adolescents in communities \nwhere outbreaks of hepatitis A are occurring. \n\u2022 Unvaccinated people who have been exposed to \n hepatitis A virus. \n\u2022 Anyone 1 year of age or older who wants protection \n from hepatitis A. Hepatitis A vaccine is not licensed for children younger \nthan 1 year of age. \nWHEN? \nFor children , the \ufb01rst dose should be given at 12 \nthrough 23 months of age. Children who are not vacci\u00ad\nnated by 2 years of age can be vaccinated at later visits. \nFor others at risk, the hepatitis A vaccine series may be \nstarted whenever a person wishes to be protected or is at risk of infection. \nFor travelers , it is best to start the vaccine series at least \none month before traveling. (Some protection may still \nresult if the vaccine is given on or closer to the travel date.) \nSome people who cannot get the vaccine before traveling, or for whom the vaccine might not be effective, can get a shot called immune globulin (IG). IG gives immediate, temporary protection. \nTwo doses of the vaccine are needed for lasting protection. These doses should be given at least 6 months apart. \nHepatitis A vaccine may be given at the same time as \nother vaccines. \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n  3 Some people should not get\nhepatitis A vaccine or should wait. \n\u2022 Anyone who has ever had a severe (life threatening) allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis A vaccine should not get another dose. \n\u2022 Anyone who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any vaccine component should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies, including a severe allergy to latex. All hepatitis A vaccines contain alum, and some hepatitis A vaccines \n contain 2-phenoxyethanol. \n\u2022 Anyone who is moderately or severely ill at the time \nthe shot is scheduled should probably wait until they recover. Ask your doctor. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. Because hepatitis A vaccine is inactivated (killed), the risk to a pregnant woman or her unborn baby is believed to be very low. But your doctor can weigh any theoretical risk from the vaccine against the need for protection. \n4 What are the risks fromhepatitis A vaccine?  \nA vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of hepatitis A vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. \nGetting hepatitis A vaccine is much safer than getting the \ndisease. \nMild problems \n\u2022 soreness where the shot was given (about 1 out of 2 \n adults, and up to 1 out of 6 children) \n\u2022 headache (about 1 out of 6 adults and 1 out of 25 \n children) \n\u2022 loss of appetite (about 1 out of 12 children) \n\u2022 tiredness (about 1 out of 14 adults)\n \n\n If these problems occur, they usually last 1 or 2 days.\nSevere problems \n\u2022 serious allergic reaction, within a few minutes to a few \nhours after the shot (very rare). 5 What if there is a moderate orsevere reaction? \nWhat should I look for? \u2022 Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or  unusual behavior. Signs of a serious allergic reaction \n can include dif \ufb01 culty breathing, hoarseness or \n wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat \n or dizziness. \nWhat should I do? \n\u2022 \tCall a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. \n\u2022 \tTell your doctor what happened, the date and time it \n happened, and when the vaccination was given. \n\u2022 \tAsk your doctor, nurse, or health department to report \n the reaction by \ufb01 ling a Vaccine Adverse Event \n Reporting System (V AERS) form. Or you can \ufb01 le this \n report through the V AERS web site at \n www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967. \nVAERS does not provide medical advice. \n6 The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program \nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) was created in 1986. \nPersons who believe they may have been injured by a \nvaccine can learn about the program and about \ufb01 ling a \nclaim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP  \nwebsite at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. \n7 How can I learn more? \n\u2022 Ask your doctor. They can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information. \n\u2022 Call your local or state health department. \n\u2022 Contact the Centers for Disease Control and \n Prevention (CDC): -\tCall 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO) or \n-Visit CDC\u2019s website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines \nVaccine Information Statement (Interim)\nHepatitis A Vaccine \n10/25/2011 \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-26 DECLARACI\u00d3N DE INFORMACI\u00d3N SOBRE VACUNAS\nVacuna contra la hepatitis A\nLo que usted necesita saber\n1 \u00bfQu\u00e9 es la hepatitis A?\nLa hepatitis A es una enfermedad hep\u00e1tica grave provocada \npor el virus de la hepatitis A (VHA).

HBVcan cause:\nAcute (short-term) illness.  This can lead to:\n\u2022 loss of appetite \u0081 diarrhea and vomiting\u0081 tiredness \u0081 jaundice (yellow skin or eyes)\u0081 pain in muscles, joints, and stomach\nAcute illness is more common among adults.\nChildren who become infected usually do not haveacute illness.\nChronic (long-term) infection .  Some people go on\nto develop chronic HBV infection. This can be veryserious, and often leads to:\u0081liver damage (cirrhosis)     \u0081liver cancer     \u0081death\nChronic infection is more common among infants\nand children than among adults. People who areinfected can spread HBV to others, even if they don\u2019tappear sick.  \n\u0081 In 2005, about 51,000 people became infected with \nhepatitis B.\n\u0081 About 1.25 million people in the United States \nhave chronic HBV infection.\n\u0081 Each year about 3,000 to 5,000 people die from \ncirrhosis or liver cancer caused by HBV .\nHepatitis B virus is spread through contact with the\nblood or other body fluids of an infected person.  Aperson can become infected by:\n- contact with a mother\u2019s blood and body fluids at \nthe time of birth;\n- contact with blood and body fluids through \nbreaks in the skin such as bites, cuts, or sores;\n- contact with objects that could have blood or body \nfluids on them such as toothbrushes or razors;\n- having unprotected sex with an infected person;\n- sharing needles when injecting drugs;- being stuck with a used needle on the job.Children and Adolescents\n\u0081 All children should get their first dose of hepatitis\nB vaccine at birth and should have completed the \nvaccine series by 6-18 months of age.\n\u0081 Children and adolescents through 18 years of\nage who did not get the vaccine when they were younger should also be vaccinated.\nAdults\n\u0081 All unvaccinated adults at risk for HBV infection\nshould be vaccinated.  This includes:\n- sex partners of people infected with HBV ,- men who have sex with men,- people who inject street drugs,- people with more than one sex partner,- people with chronic liver or kidney disease,- people with jobs that expose them to human \nblood,\n- household contacts of people infected with HBV ,- residents and staff in institutions for the\ndevelopmentally disabled,\n- kidney dialysis patients,Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, and\nthe serious consequences of HBV infection, includingliver cancer and cirrhosis.\nRoutine hepatitis B vaccination of U.S. children\nbegan in 1991.  Since then, the reported incidence ofacute hepatitis B among children and adolescentshas dropped by more than 95% \u2013 and by 75% in allage groups.\nHepatitis B vaccine is made from a part of the hepatitis\nB virus.  It cannot cause HBV infection.\nHepatitis B vaccine is usually given as a series of 3\nor 4 shots .  This vaccine series gives long-term\nprotection from HBV infection, possibly lifelong.\n2Hepatitis B vaccine: Why get\nvaccinated?\n3Who should get hepatitis B\nvaccine and when?Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis.- people who travel to countries where hepatitis \nB is common,\n- people with HIV infection.\n\u0081 Anyone else who wants to be protected from HBV\ninfection may be vaccinated.\n4Who should NOT get hepatitis\nB vaccine?\n\u0081 Anyone with a life-threatening allergy to baker\u2019s \nyeast , or to any other component of the vaccine,\nshould not get hepatitis B vaccine.  T ell your provider if you have any severe allergies.\n\u0081 Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic\nreaction to a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine\nshould not get another dose.\n\u0081 Anyone who is moderately or severely ill when a \ndose of vaccine is scheduled should probably wait until they recover before getting the vaccine.\nY our provider can give you more information about\nthese precautions.\nPregnant women who need protection from HBV\ninfection may be vaccinated.\n5Hepatitis B vaccine risks\nHepatitis B is a very safe vaccine.  Most people do\nnot have any problems with it. \nThe following mild problems have been reported:\n\u0081 Soreness where the shot was given (up to about 1 \nperson in 4).\n\u0081 T emperature of 99.9\u00b0F or higher (up to about 1 \nperson in 15).\nSevere problems are extremely rare.  Severe allergic\nreactions are believed to occur about once in 1.1million doses.\nA vaccine, like any medicine, could cause a serious\nreaction.  But the risk of a vaccine causing seriousharm, or death, is extremely small.  More than 100million people have gotten hepatitis B vaccine in theUnited States.\n6What if there is a moderate or\nsevere reaction?8How can I learn more?\n\u0081 Ask your doctor or nurse.  They can give you the \nvaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information.\n\u0081 Call your local or state health department.\u0081 Contact the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC):\n- Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO)\n- Visit CDC websites at:\nwww.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hepatitiswww.cdc.gov/vaccines\nwww.cdc.gov/travel7The National Vaccine Injury\nCompensation Program\nIn the event that you or your child has a serious\nreaction to a vaccine, a federal program has beencreated to help pay for the care of those who havebeen harmed.\nFor details about the National Vaccine Injury\nCompensation Program, call 1-800-338-2382 or visittheir website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation .\nddeeppaarrttmmeenntt  ooff  hheeaalltthh  aanndd  hhuummaann  sseerrvviicceess\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nVaccine Information Statement (Interim)\nHepatitis B (7/18/07)                           42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-26What should I look for?\n\u0081 Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or \nbehavior changes.

Visite http://www.immunize.org/vis \n1 What is HPV?\nGenital human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the United States. More than half of sexually active men and women are infected with HPV at some time in their lives. \nAbout 20 million Americans are currently infected, \nand about 6 million more get infected each year. HPV is usually spread through sexual contact. \nMost HPV infections don\u2019t cause any symptoms, and \ngo away on their own. But HPV can cause cervical \ncancer in women. Cervical cancer is the 2nd leading \ncause of cancer deaths among women around the world. In the United States, about 10,000 women get cervical cancer every year and about 4,000 are expected to die from it. \nHPV is also associated with several less common \ncancers, such as vaginal and vulvar cancers in women and other types of cancer in both men and women. It can also cause genital warts and warts in the throat. \nThere is no cure for HPV infection, but some of the \nproblems it causes can be treated. \n2 HPV vaccine - Why get\nvaccinated?\nHPV vaccine is important because it can prevent \nmost cases of cervical cancer  in females, if it is \ngiven before a person is exposed to the virus. \nProtection from HPV vaccine is expected to be long-lasting. \nBut vaccination is not a substitute for cervical cancer screening. Women should still get regular Pap tests. \nThe vaccine you are getting is one of two vaccines \nthat can be given to prevent HPV. It may be given \nto both males and females. In addition to preventing cervical cancer, it can also prevent vaginal and \nvulvar cancer  in females, and genital warts and \nanal cancer  in both males and females. \nThe other vaccine is given to females only for prevention of cervical cancer. 3 Who should get this HPV\nvaccine and when?\nFemales: Routine Vaccination \n\u2022 HPV vaccine is recommended for girls 11 or 12 \nyears of age. It may be given to girls starting at age 9. \nWhy is HPV vaccine given to girls at this age? \nIt is important for girls to get HPV vaccine before\n their \ufb01rst sexual contact \u2013 because they won\u2019t have \nbeen exposed to human papillomavirus. \nOnce a girl or woman has been infected with the \nvirus, the vaccine might not work as well or might not work at all. \nFemales: Catch-Up Vaccination \u2022 The vaccine is also recommended for girls and\n women 13 through 26 years of age who did not \nget all 3 doses when they were younger. \nMales Males 9 through 26 years of age may get HPV vaccine. As with females, it is best to be vaccinated before the \ufb01rst sexual contact. \nHPV vaccine is given as a 3-dose series \n1st Dose Now \n2nd Dose 1 to 2 months after Dose 1 \n3rd Dose 6 months after Dose 1 \nAdditional (booster) doses are not recommended. \nHPV vaccine may be given at the same time as other \nvaccines. \n4 Some people should not get HPV\nvaccine or should wait\n\u2022 \tAnyone who has ever had a life-threatening \nallergic reaction to any component of HPV vaccine, or to a previous dose of HPV vaccine, should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if the person getting vaccinated has any severe allergies, including an allergy to yeast.  \n \n \n  \n    \n 5 What are the risks from this \nvaccine? \u2022 \tHPV vaccine is not recommended for pregnant   \nwomen. However, receiving HPV vaccine when  \n pregnant is not a reason to consider terminating the \n pregnancy. Women who are breast feeding may \n get the vaccine. \n Any woman who learns she was pregnant when she\n got this HPV vaccine is encouraged to contact the  \n manufacturer\u2019s  HPV in pregnancy registry  at \n 800-986-8999. This will help us learn how pregnant\n women respond to the vaccine. \n\u2022 \tPeople who are mildly ill when a dose of HPV  \n vaccine is planned can still be vaccinated. People  \n with a moderate or severe illness  should wait until  \n they are better. \nThis HPV vaccine has been used in the U.S. and \naround the world for several years and has been very safe. \nHowever, any medicine could possibly cause a \nserious problem, such as a severe allergic reaction. The risk of any vaccine causing a serious injury, or death, is extremely small. \nLife-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are \nvery rare. If they do occur, it would be within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. \nSeveral mild to moderate problems are known to \noccur with HPV vaccine. These do not last long and go away on their own. \n\u2022 \tReactions in the arm where the shot was given: \n -\tPain (about 8 people in 10) \n -\tRedness or swelling (about 1 person in 4)\n \u2022 Fever: \n -\tMild (100\u00b0 F) (about 1 person in 10) \n -\tModerate (102\u00b0 F) (about 1 person in 65) \n\u2022 Other problems:  - Headache (about 1 person in 3) \n - Fainting. Brief fainting spells and related symptoms \n  (such as jerking movements) can happen after any \n  medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting  \n  or lying down for about 15 minutes after a  \n  vaccination can help prevent fainting and  \n  injuries caused by falls.  Tell your doctor if the  \n  patient feels dizzy or light-headed, or has vision  \n  changes or ringing in the ears. Like all vaccines, HPV vaccines will continue to be \nmonitored for unusual or severe problems. \n6 What if there is a severe\nreaction? \nWhat should I look for? \nSerious allergic reactions including rash; swelling of the hands and feet, face, or lips; and breathing dif\ufb01 culty. \nWhat should I do?  \u2022 Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right  \n  \n  away.\n \n \u2022 Tell the doctor what happened, the date and time  \n  it happened, and when the vaccination was given. \n \u2022 Ask your doctor to report the reaction by \ufb01ling \n  a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System \n  (V AERS) form. Or you can \ufb01  le this report through \n  the V AERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by \n  calling 1-800-822-7967.  \nVAERS does not provide medical advice. \n7 The National Vaccine Injury \nCompensation Program \nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program \n(VICP) was created in 1986. \nPersons who believe they may have been injured by a \nvaccine can learn about the program and about \ufb01 ling a \nclaim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP  \nwebsite at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. \n8 How can I learn more?\n\u2022 \tAsk your doctor.

El c\u00e1ncer del \ncuello del \u00fatero es la segunda causa principal de muertes por c\u00e1ncer entre las mujeres del mundo.

HPV is usually spread through sexual contact. \nMost HPV infections don\u2019t cause any symptoms, and \ngo away on their own. But HPV can cause cervical \ncancer in women. Cervical cancer is the 2nd leading \ncause of cancer deaths among women around theworld. In the United States, about 10,000 women get cervical cancer every year and about 4,000 are expected to die from it. \nHPV is also associated with several less common \ncancers, such as vaginal and vulvar cancers in women and other types of cancer in both men and women. It can also cause genital warts and warts in the throat. \nThere is no cure for HPV infection, but some of the \nproblems it causes can be treated. \nHPV vaccine - Why get \nvaccinated?2Routine Vaccination \n\u2022 HPV vaccine is recommended for girls 11 or 12   \n years of age . It may be given to girls starting at \n age 9. \n Why is HPV vaccine given to girls at this age?  \n It is important for girls to get HPV vaccine before   \n their \ufb01 rst sexual contact \u2013 because they won\u2019t have \n been exposed to human papillomavirus. \n Once a girl or woman has been infected with the \n virus, the vaccine might not work as well or might   not work at all.\nCatch-Up Vaccination  \n\u2022 The vaccine is also recommended for girls and women 13 through 26 years of age  who did not \n get all 3 doses when they were younger. \nHPV vaccine is given as a 3-dose series\n  1st Dose Now   2nd Dose 1 to 2 months after Dose 1   3rd Dose 6 months after Dose 1 \nAdditional (booster) doses are not recommended. HPV vaccine may be given at the same time as other \nvaccines. Who should get this HPV \nvaccine and when?3\nSome people should not get HPV vaccine or should wait4\n\u2022 Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening \n allergic reaction to any component of HPV  vaccine, or to a previous dose of HPV vaccine,  should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if the  person getting vaccinated has any severe allergies, including an allergy to latex. \n\u2022 HPV vaccine is not recommended for pregnant   \n women . However, receiving HPV vaccine when  \n pregnant is not a reason to consider terminating the   pregnancy. Women who are breast feeding may  get the vaccine. HPV\nHPV vaccine is important because it can prevent \nmost cases of cervical cancer  in females, if it is \ngiven before a person is exposed to the virus.  \nProtection from HPV vaccine is expected to be long-\nlasting. But vaccination is not a substitute for cervical cancer screening. Women should still get regular Pap tests.  \nThe vaccine you are getting is one of two HPV \nvaccines that can be given to prevent cervial cancer . It is given to females only. \nThe other vaccine may be given to both males and \nfemales. It can also prevent most genital warts. It has also been shown to prevent some vaginal, vulvar and anal cancers. Cervarix\u00ae\nMany Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages.

The risk of any vaccine causing a serious injury, or death, is extremely small. \nLife-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are \nvery rare. If they do occur, it would be within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.\nSeveral mild to moderate problems  are known to \noccur with HPV vaccine. These do not last long and go away on their own.\n\u2022 Reactions where the shot was given:\n - Pain (about 9 people in 10)  - Redness or swelling (about 1 person in 2)\n\u2022 Other mild reactions:\n - Fever of 99.5\u00b0F or higher (about 1 person in 8) - Headache or fatigue (about 1 person in 2)  - Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain   \n  (about 1 person in 4) \n - Muscle or joint pain (up to 1 person in 2)\n\u2022 Fainting:\n Brief fainting spells and related symptoms (such as  \n jerking movements) can happen after any medical   procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying \n down for about 15 minutes after a vaccination    can help prevent fainting and injuries caused by falls.  Tell your doctor if the patient feels dizzy or \n light-headed, or has vision  changes or ringing in    the ears.\nLike all vaccines, HPV vaccines will continue to be \nmonitored for unusual or severe problems.

El VPH se contagia generalmente por contacto sexual. \nLa mayor\u00eda de las infecciones por el VPH no producen \nning\u00fan s\u00edntoma, y desaparecen solas. Pero el VPH puede \nprovocar c\u00e1ncer de cuello uterino en las mujeres. El c\u00e1ncer \nde cuello uterino es la segunda causa principal de muerte por \nc\u00e1ncer en las mujeres de todo el mundo. Cada a\u00f1o, en los \nEstados Unidos, alrededor de 10,000 mujeres contraen c\u00e1ncer \nde cuello uterino y se prev\u00e9 que alrededor de 4000 morir\u00e1n \npor esta causa. \nEl VPH tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 relacionado con varios tipos de c\u00e1ncer \nmenos comunes, como el c\u00e1ncer vaginal y vulvar en las \nmujeres y otros tipos de c\u00e1ncer tanto en hombres como \nen mujeres.

For most people, symptoms last only a few days. They include:\u2022 fever/chills \u2022 sore throat \u2022 muscle aches \u2022 fatigue\u2022 cough   \u2022 headache \u2022 runny or stuffy nose\nOther illnesses can have the same symptoms and are often \nmistaken for in \ufb02 uenza.\nYoung children, people 65 and older, pregnant women, and \npeople with certain health conditions \u2013 such as heart, lung or kidney disease, or a weakened immune system \u2013 can get much sicker. Flu can cause high fever and pneumonia, and make existing medical conditions worse. It can cause diarrhea \nand seizures in children. Each year thousands of people die \nfrom in \ufb02 uenza and even more require hospitalization. \nBy getting \ufb02 u vaccine you can protect yourself from \nin\ufb02 uenza and may also avoid spreading in \ufb02 uenza to others.  Who should get inactivated \nin\ufb02 uenza vaccine and when? 3\nThere are two types of in \ufb02 uenza vaccine: \n1. Inactivated (killed) vaccine, the \u201c \ufb02 u shot,\u201d is given by \ninjection with a needle. \n2. Live, attenuated  (weakened) in \ufb02 uenza vaccine is \nsprayed into the nostrils. This vaccine is described in a \nseparate Vaccine Information Statement.  \nA \u201chigh-dose\u201d inactivated in \ufb02 uenza vaccine is available \nfor people 65 years of age and older. Ask your doctor for more information.\nIn\ufb02 uenza viruses are always changing, so annual\nvaccination is recommended. Each year scientists try to match the viruses in the vaccine to those most likely to cause \ufb02 u that year. Flu vaccine will not prevent disease \nfrom other viruses, including \ufb02 u viruses not contained in \nthe vaccine.\nIt takes up to 2 weeks for protection to develop after the \nshot. Protection lasts about a year. WHO\nAll people 6 months of age and older should get \ufb02 u \nvaccine.\nVaccination is especially important for people at higher \nrisk of severe in \ufb02 uenza and their close contacts, \nincluding healthcare personnel and close contacts of children younger than 6 months.\nWHEN\nGet the vaccine as soon as it is available. This should \nprovide protection if the \ufb02 u season comes early. You can \nget the vaccine as long as illness is occurring in your community.\nIn\ufb02 uenza can occur at any time, but most in \ufb02 uenza occurs \nfrom October through May. In recent seasons, most infections have occurred in January and February. Getting vaccinated in December, or even later, will still be bene\ufb01 cial in most years.\nAdults and older children need one dose of in \ufb02 uenza \nvaccine each year. But some children younger than 9 years of age need two doses to be protected. Ask your doctor.\nIn\ufb02 uenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other \nvaccines, including pneumococcal vaccine.Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages.

The risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. \nSerious problems from inactivated in \ufb02 uenza vaccine are \nvery rare. The viruses in inactivated in \ufb02 uenza vaccine have \nbeen killed, so you cannot get in \ufb02 uenza from the vaccine. \nMild problems:  \n\u2022 soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given \u2022 hoarseness; sore, red or itchy eyes; cough\u2022 fever     \u2022 aches     \u2022 headache     \u2022 itching    \u2022 fatigueIf these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and last 1-2 days. \nModerate problems:  \nYoung children who get inactivated \ufb02 u vaccine and pneu-\nmococcal vaccine (PCV13) at the same time appear to be at increased risk for seizures caused by fever. Ask your doctor for more information.\nTell your doctor if a child who is getting \ufb02 u vaccine has \never had a seizure.\nSevere problems:\n\u2022 Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are  very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few  minutes to a few hours after the shot. \n\u2022 In 1976, a type of inactivated in \ufb02 uenza (swine \ufb02 u) \n vaccine was associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome  (GBS). Since  then, \ufb02 u vaccines have not been clearly \n linked to GBS.  However, if there is a risk of GBS from \n current \ufb02 u vaccines, it would be no more than 1 or 2 \n cases per million people vaccinated. This is much lower  than the risk of severe in \ufb02 uenza, which can be prevented \n by vaccination.The National Vaccine Injury \nCompensation Program7\nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program \n(VICP) was created in 1986.\nPeople who believe they may have been injured by a \nvaccine can learn about the program and about \ufb01 ling a \nclaim by calling 1-800-338-2382 , or visiting the VICP \nwebsite at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation .\nOne brand of inactivated \ufb02 u vaccine, called A \ufb02 uria, \nshould not be given  to children 8 years of age or \nyounger, except in special circumstances.

For most people, symptoms last only a few days. They include: \n\u2022 fever/chills \u2022 sore throat \u2022 muscle aches \u2022 fatigue\n\u2022 cough   \u2022 headache \u2022 runny or stuffy nose\nOther illnesses can have the same symptoms and are often \nmistaken for in \ufb02 uenza.\nYoung children, people 65 and older, pregnant women, and \npeople with certain health conditions \u2013 such as heart, lung or kidney disease, or a weakened immune system \u2013 can get much sicker. Flu can cause high fever and pneumonia, and make existing medical conditions worse. It can cause diarrhea and seizures in children. Each year thousands of people die from in \ufb02 uenza and even more require hospitalization. \nBy getting \ufb02 u vaccine you can protect yourself from \nin\ufb02 uenza and may also avoid spreading in \ufb02 uenza to others. \nThere are two types of in \ufb02 uenza vaccine: \n 1. Live, attenuated  in\ufb02 uenza vaccine (LAIV) contains live \nbut attenuated (weakened) in \ufb02 uenza virus. It is sprayed into \nthe nostrils.\n 2. Inactivated  (killed) in \ufb02 uenza vaccine, the \u201c \ufb02 u shot,\u201d is \ngiven by injection with a needle. This vaccine is described \nin a separate Vaccine Information Statement.\nIn\ufb02 uenza viruses are always changing, so annual vaccination \nis recommended. Each year scientists try to match the viruses \nin the vaccine to those most likely to cause \ufb02 u that year. Flu \nvaccine will not prevent disease from other viruses, including \ufb02 u viruses not contained in the vaccine.\nIt takes up to 2 weeks for protection to develop after the \nvaccination. Protection lasts about a year. \nLAIV does not contain thimerosal or other preservatives.LAIV is recommended for healthy people 2 through 49 years \nof age , who are not pregnant and do not have certain health \nconditions (see #4, below).

La vacuna desactivada (virus muerto) contra la influenza, cono-\ncida como la \u201cvacuna contra la influenza\u201d, se inyecta en el m\u00fasculo. \nEsta vacuna se describe en una Hoja de Informaci\u00f3n sobre las \nVacunas, por separado. \nLos virus de la influenza cambian constantemente. Por eso, se reco-\nmienda una vacunaci\u00f3n anual. Cada a\u00f1o los cient\u00edficos tratan de que los virus de la vacuna coincidan con los que tienen m\u00e1s probabili-dades de causar la influenza ese a\u00f1o. La vacuna contra la influenza no prevendr\u00e1 otras enfermedades causadas por otros virus, incluyendo los virus de influenza que no est\u00e1n incluidos en la vacuna.\nDespu\u00e9s de la vacunaci\u00f3n, toma hasta 2 semanas para desarrollar \nprotecci\u00f3n. La protecci\u00f3n dura hasta un a\u00f1o.\nLa LAIV no contiene timerosal u otros conservantes. La LAIV est\u00e1 recomendada para las personas sanas de 2 a 49 a\u00f1os \nde edad, que no est\u00e9n embarazadas y que no tengan ciertos pro-\nblemas de salud (vea el No. 4 abajo).Hojas de Informaci\u00f3n sobre las Vacunas est\u00e1n disponibles en espa\u00f1ol y en muchos otros idiomas.

It is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children 2 through 18 years old in the United States. Meningitis is an infection of the covering of the brain and the spinal cord. \nMeningococcal disease also causes blood infections. About 1,000 \u2013 1,200 people get meningococcal disease \neach year in the U.S. Even when they are treated with antibiotics, 10-15% of these people die. Of those who live, another 11%-19% lose their arms or legs, have problems with their nervous systems, become deaf or mentally retarded, or suffer seizures or strokes. \nAnyone can get meningococcal disease. But it is most \ncommon in infants less than one year of age and people 16-21 years. Children with certain medical conditions, such as lack of a spleen, have an increased risk of getting meningococcal disease. College freshmen living in dorms are also at increased risk. \nMeningococcal infections can be treated with drugs such \nas penicillin. Still, many people who get the disease die from it, and many others are affected for life. This is why preventing the disease through use of meningococcal vaccine is important for people at highest risk. \n2 Meningococcal vaccine \nThere are two kinds of meningococcal vaccine in the U.S.: \n\u2022 Meningococcal conjugate vaccine ( MCV4) is the \npreferred vaccine for people 55 years of age and \n younger. \u2022 Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( MPSV4) has \nbeen available since the 1970s. It is the only meningo-\ncoccal vaccine licensed for people older than 55. \nBoth vaccines can prevent 4 types of meningococcal disease, including 2 of the 3 types most common in the United States and a type that causes epidemics in Africa. There are other types of meningococcal disease; the vaccines do not protect against these . Who should get meningococcalvaccine and when? 3 \nRoutine Vaccination  \nTwo doses of MCV4 are recommended for adolescents 11 through 18 years of age: the \ufb01 rst dose at 11 or 12 \nyears of age, with a booster dose at age 16. \nAdolescents in this age group with HIV infection should \nget three doses: 2 doses 2 months apart at 11 or 12 years, plus a booster at age 16. \nIf the \ufb01  rst dose (or series) is given between 13 and 15 \nyears of age, the booster should be given between 16 \nand 18. If the \ufb01 rst dose (or series) is given after the 16th \nbirthday, a booster is not needed. \nOther People at Increased Risk \n\u2022 \tCollege freshmen living in dormitories. \n\u2022 \tLaboratory personnel who are routinely exposed to \n meningococcal bacteria. \u2022 \tU.S. military recruits. \n\u2022 \tAnyone traveling to, or living in, a part of the world \nwhere meningococcal disease is common, such as \n parts of Africa. \n\u2022 \tAnyone who has a damaged spleen, or whose spleen \nhas been removed. \n\u2022 \tAnyone who has persistent complement component \nde\ufb01ciency (an immune system disorder). \n\u2022 \tPeople who might have been exposed to meningitis during an outbreak. \nChildren between 9 and 23 months of age, and anyone else with certain medical conditions need 2 doses for adequate protection. Ask your doctor about the number and timing of doses, and the need for booster doses. \nMCV4 is the preferred vaccine for people in these \ngroups who are 9 months through 55 years of age. MPSV4 can be used for adults older than 55. \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n  \n 4 Some people should not get meningococcal vaccine or should wait. \n\u2022 Anyone who has ever had a severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a previous dose of MCV4 or MPSV4 vaccine should not get another dose of either \nvaccine. \n\u2022 Anyone who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any vaccine component should not get the vaccine. Tell \nyour doctor if you have any severe allergies. \n\u2022 Anyone who is moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should probably wait until they recover. Ask your doctor. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. \n\u2022 Meningococcal vaccines may be given to pregnant women. MCV4 is a fairly new vaccine and has not been studied in pregnant women as much as MPSV4 has. It should be used only if clearly needed. The manufacturers of MCV4 maintain pregnancy registries for women who are vaccinated while pregnant. \nExcept for children with sickle cell disease or without a working spleen, meningococcal vaccines may be given at the same time as other vaccines. \n5 What are the risks from meningococcal vaccines? \nA vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of meningococcal vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. \nBrief fainting spells and related symptoms (such as jerking or seizure-like movements) can follow a vaccination. They happen most often with adolescents, and they can result in falls and injuries. \nSitting or lying down for about 15 minutes after getting the shot \u2013 \nespecially if you feel faint \u2013 can help prevent these injuries. \nMild problems \nAs many as half the people who get meningococcal \nvaccines have mild side effects, such as redness or pain where the shot was given. \nIf these problems occur, they usually last for 1 or 2 days. \nThey are more common after MCV4 than after MPSV4. \nA small percentage of people who receive the vaccine \ndevelop a mild fever. \nSevere problems \nSerious allergic reactions, within a few minutes to a few \nhours of the shot, are very rare. 6 What if there is a moderate orsevere reaction? \nWhat should I look for? \nAny unusual condition, such as a severe allergic reaction \nor a high fever.  If a severe allergic reaction occurred, it would be within a few minutes to an hour after the shot. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include dif\ufb01culty \nbreathing, weakness, hoarseness or wheezing, a fast heart beat, hives, dizziness, paleness, or swelling of the throat. \nWhat should I do? \n\u2022 Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it \nhappened, and when the vaccination was given. \n\u2022 Ask your provider to report the reaction by \ufb01 ling a \nVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) form. Or you can \ufb01le this report through the V AERS \n website at www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling \n1-800-822-7967. \nVAERS does not provide medical advice. \n7 The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program \nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) was created in 1986. \nPersons who believe they may have been injured by a \nvaccine can learn about the program and about \ufb01 ling a \nclaim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP  \nwebsite at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. \n8 How can I learn more? \n\u2022 Your doctor can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information. \n\u2022 Call your local or state health department. \n\u2022 Contact the Centers for Disease Control and \n Prevention (CDC): -Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO) or \n-Visit CDC\u2019s website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines \nVaccine Information Statement (Interim)\nMeningococcal Vaccines \n10/14/2011 \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-26 Meningococcal VIS - Spanish (10/14/11)DECLARACI\u00d3N DE INFORMACI\u00d3N SOBRE VACUNAS\nVacunas contra el meningococo\nLo que necesita saber\n2Vacuna contra el meningococoLa enfermedad meningoc\u00f3cica es una enfermedad grave \ncausada por una bacteria.

Entre el 10% y el 15% de ellas mueren, incluso si se las tratan con antibi\u00f3ticos. De las que sobreviven, entre el 11% y el 19% pierden los brazos o las piernas, presentan problemas en el sistema nervioso, quedan sordas o con retraso mental, o sufren convulsiones o derrames cerebrales.\n Cualquiera puede contraer la enfermedad meningoc\u00f3cica, \npero es m\u00e1s com\u00fan en beb\u00e9s de menos de un a\u00f1o y en personas entre 16 y 21 a\u00f1os. Los ni\u00f1os con ciertos problemas m\u00e9dicos, como la falta de bazo, tienen mayor riesgo de contraer la enfermedad meningoc\u00f3cica. El riesgo tambi\u00e9n es mayor en estudiantes universitarios de primer a\u00f1o que viven en residencias estudiantiles.\n Las infecciones meningoc\u00f3cicas se pueden tratar con \nmedicamentos como la penicilina.

Los fabricantes de MCV4 mantienen registros de las mujeres embarazadas que reciben la vacuna.\nA excepci\u00f3n de los ni\u00f1os con anemia de c\u00e9lulas falciformes o que no tienen un bazo funcional, las vacunas contra el meningococo se pueden aplicar al mismo tiempo que otras vacunas.\nDespu\u00e9s de una vacunaci\u00f3n, pueden ocurrir episodios de desmayo \nde corta duraci\u00f3n y s\u00edntomas relacionados (como espasmos o movimientos similares a una convulsi\u00f3n). Estos suceden m\u00e1s a menudo en adolescentes y pueden provocar ca\u00eddas y lesiones. \nSentarse o recostarse por unos 15 minutos despu\u00e9s de obtener la \nvacuna, en especial si se siente mareado, puede ayudar a prevenir estas lesiones.\u00bfA qu\u00e9 debo prestar atenci\u00f3n?\nPreste atenci\u00f3n a cualquier cosa fuera de lo com\u00fan, como una \nreacci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgica grave o fiebre alta.

Visite www.immunize.org/vis\n 1 Why get vaccinated?\nMeasles, mumps, and rubella are serious diseases. Before \nvaccines they were very common, especially among children. \nMeasles\n\u2022\tMeasles virus causes rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and fever.\n\u2022\tIt can lead to ear infection, pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring), brain damage, and death.\nMumps\u2022\tMumps virus causes fever, headache, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and swollen glands.\n\u2022\tIt can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and rarely sterility.\nRubella (German Measles)\u2022\tRubella virus causes rash, arthritis (mostly in women), and mild fever.\n\u2022\tIf a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage or her baby could be born with serious birth defects.\nThese diseases spread from person to person through the air. Y ou can easily catch them by being around someone who is already infected.\nMeasles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine can protect \nchildren (and adults) from all three of these diseases. \nThanks to successful vaccination programs these diseases \nare much less common in the U.S. than they used to be.  But if we stopped vaccinating they would return.  2  Who should get MMR vaccine and when?\nChildren should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine:\n\u2022\tFirst Dose: 12\u201315 months of age\n\u2022\tSecond Dose: 4\u20136 years of age (may be given earlier, if \nat least 28 days after the 1st dose)\nSome infants younger than 12 months should get a dose of MMR if they are traveling out of the country. (This dose will not count toward their routine series.) \nSome adults should also get MMR vaccine: Generally, \nanyone 18 years of age or older who was born after 1956 should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine, unless they can show that they have either been vaccinated or had all three diseases.  \nMMR vaccine may be given at the same time as other \nvaccines.\nChildren between 1 and 12 years of age can get a \n\u201ccombination\u201d vaccine called MMRV , which contains both MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines. There is a separate Vaccine Information Statement for MMRV .\n 3  Some people should not get MMR vaccine or should wait.\n\u2022\tAnyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. \n\u2022\tAnyone who had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of MMR or MMRV vaccine should not get another dose.\n\u2022\tSome people who are sick at the time the shot is scheduled may be advised to wait until they recover before getting MMR vaccine.\n\u2022\tPregnant women should not get MMR vaccine. Pregnant women who need the vaccine should wait until after giving birth. Women should avoid getting pregnant for 4 weeks after vaccination with MMR vaccine.\u2022\tTell your doctor if the person getting the vaccine:\n- Has HIV/AIDS, or another disease that affects the \nimmune system\n- Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune \nsystem, such as steroids \n- Has any kind of cancer\n- Is being treated for cancer with radiation or drugs- Has ever had a low platelet count (a blood disorder)- Has gotten another vaccine within the past 4 weeks- Has recently had a transfusion or received other \nblood products\nAny of these might be a reason to not get the vaccine, or delay vaccination until later.\n 4  What are the risks from  MMR vaccine?\nA vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions.\nThe risk of MMR vaccine causing serious harm, or death, \nis extremely small.\nGetting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, \nmumps or rubella.\nMost people who get MMR vaccine do not have any \nserious problems with it.\nMild problems\n\u2022\tFever (up to 1 person out of 6)\n\u2022\tMild rash (about 1 person out of 20)\n\u2022\tSwelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (about 1 person out of 75)\nIf these problems occur, it is usually within 6-14 days after the shot. They occur less often after the second dose.\nModerate problems\n\u2022\tSeizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (about 1 out of 3,000 doses)\n\u2022\tTemporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women (up to 1 out of 4)\n\u2022\tTemporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 out of 30,000 doses)\nSevere problems (very rare) \u2022\tSerious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses)\n\u2022\tSeveral other severe problems have been reported after a child gets MMR vaccine, including:\n- Deafness - Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness- Permanent brain damage\nThese are so rare that it is hard to tell whether they are caused by the vaccine. 5  What if there is a serious reaction?\nWhat should I look for?\u2022\tLook for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. \n \nSigns of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, \nswelling\tof\tthe\tface\tand\tthroat,\tdifficulty\tbreathing, \t\na fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.\nWhat should I do?\u2022\tIf you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can\u2019t wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.\n\u2022\tAfterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). \nYour\tdoctor\tmight\tfile\tthis\treport,\tor\tyou\tcan\tdo\tit\t\nyourself through the V AERS web site at  www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967.\nVAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice.\n 6  The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program\nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines.\nPersons who believe they may have been injured by a \nvaccine\tcan\tlearn\tabout\tthe\tprogram\tand\tabout\tfiling\ta\t\nclaim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP \nwebsite at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation.\n 7 How can I learn more?\n\u2022\tAsk your doctor.\n\u2022\tCall your local or state health department.\n\u2022\tContact the Centers for Disease Control and  \nPrevention (CDC): \n- Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO ) or \n- Visit CDC\u2019s website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines\n  Vaccine Information Statement (Interim)\n MMR Vaccine\n  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-264/20/2012Office Use OnlyHOJAS DE INFORMACI\u00d3N SOBRE VACUNAS\nVacuna            MMR\nLo que usted necesita saber\nEl sarampi\u00f3n, las paperas y la rub\u00e9ola son enfermedades \ngraves.

But children can get the \nsecond dose up through 12 years as long as it is at least 3 \nmonths after the \ufb01rst dose. \nChildren may also get these vaccines as 2 separate shots: \nMMR (measles, mumps and rubella) and varicella \nvaccines. \n1 Shot (MMRV) or 2 Shots (MMR & Varicella)? \n\u2022 Both options give the same protection. \n\u2022 One less shot with MMRV . \n\u2022 Children who got the first dose as MMR\nV have had  \nmore fevers and fever-related seizures (about 1 in  \n1,250) than children who got the first dose as separate shots of MMR and varicella vaccines on the same day (about 1 in 2,500). \nYour \nhealth-care provider can give you more information, \ninclu\nding the Vaccine Information Statements for MMR \nand Varicella vaccines. \nAnyone 13 or older who needs protection from these \ndiseases should get MMR and varicella vaccines as separate shots. \nMMRV may be given at the same time as other vaccines. \nSome children should not get \nMMRV vaccine or should wait 3 \nChildren should not get MMRV vaccine if they: \n\u2022 Have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a \nprevious dose of MMRV vaccine, or to either MMR or varicella vaccine. \n\u2022 Have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine, including gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin. \nTell the doctor if your child has \nany severe allergies. \n\u2022 Have HIV/AIDS, or another disease that af\nfects the \nimmune system. \n\u2022 Are being treated with drugs that af\nfect the immune \nsystem, including high doses of oral steroids for 2   \nweeks or longer. \n\u2022 Have any kind of cancer. \n\u2022 Are being treated for cancer with radiation or drug s. What are the risks from MMRV \nvaccine? 4\nA vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing \nserious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The \nrisk of MMRV vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is \nextremely small. \nGetting MMRV vaccine is much safer than getting mea sles, \nmumps, rubella, or chickenpox. \nMost children who get MMRV vaccine do not have any \nproblems with it. \nMild Problems \n\u2022 Fever (about 1 child out of 5). \n\u2022 Mild rash (about 1 child out of 20). \n\u2022 Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (rare). \nIf these problems happen, it is usually within 5-12 days \nafter the \ufb01  rst dose. They happen less often after the second \ndose. \nModerate Problems \n\u2022 Seizure caused by fever (about 1 child in 1,250 who get \n MMRV), usually 5-12 days after the \ufb01  rst dose. They \n happen less often when MMR and varicella vaccines \n are given at the same visit as separate shots (about 1   \n child in 2,500 who get these two vaccines), and rarely  \n after a 2nd dose of MMRV . \n\u2022 Temporary low platelet count, which can cause a   \n bleeding disorder (about 1 child out of 40,000). \nSevere Problems (Very Rare)  \nSeveral severe problems have been reported following \nMMR vaccine, and might also happen after MMRV . These \ninclude severe allergic reactions (fewer than 4 per million), What if there is a severe \nreaction? 5\nWhat should I look for? \nAny unusual condition, such as a high fever or beha vior \nchanges. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can in clude \ndif\ufb01  culty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives , paleness, \nweakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. \nWhat should I do? \n \u2022 Call  a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. \n \u2022 Tell  the doctor what happened, the date and time it \n  happened, and when the vaccination was given. \n \u2022 Ask  your provider to report the reaction by \ufb01  ling a \n  Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System    \n  (V AERS) form. Or you can \ufb01  le this report through\n  the V AERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by \n  calling 1-800-822-7967 .\n \nVAERS does not provide medical advice. \nHow can I learn more? 7\n\u2022 Ask your provider. They can give you the vaccine \n package insert or suggest other sources of information. \n\u2022 Call your local or state health department. \n\u2022 Contact the Centers for Disease Control and \n Prevention (CDC): \n - Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO) \n - Visit CDC\u2019s website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention \nVaccine Information Statement (Interim) \nMMRV Vaccine (5/21/10)                          42 U.S.C. \u00a7300aa-26 The National Vaccine Injury \nCompensation Program 6\nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program \n(VICP) was created in 1986.  \nPersons who believe they may have been injured by a \nvaccine may \ufb01  le a claim with VICP by calling \n1-800-338-2382  or visiting their website at \nwww.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation . Check with your doctor if the child: \n\u2022 Has a history of seizures, or has a parent, brother or   \n sister with a history of seizures. \n\u2022 Has a parent, brother or sister with a history of immune  \n system problems. \n\u2022 Has ever had a low platelet count, or another blood \n disorder. \n\u2022 Recently had a transfusion or received other blood   \n products. \n\u2022 Might be pregnant. \nChildren who are moderately or severely ill at the time  \nthe shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover \nbefore getting MMRV vaccine. Children who are only \nmildly ill may usually get the vaccine. \nAsk your provider for more information. and problems such as: \n - Deafness. \n - Long-term seizures, coma, lowered consciousness. \n - Permanent brain damage. \nBecause these problems occur so rarely, we can\u2019t be sure \nwhether they are caused by the vaccine or not.

Visite www.immunize.org/vis\n 1 Why get vaccinated?\nPneumococcal conjugate vaccine (called PCV13 or \nPrevnar\u00ae 13) is recommended to protect infants and \ntoddlers, and some older children and adults with certain health conditions, from pneumococcal disease.\nPneumococcal disease is caused by infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. These bacteria can \nspread from person to person through close contact.\nPneumococcal disease can lead to severe health \nproblems, including pneumonia, blood infections, and meningitis. \nMeningitis is an infection of the covering of the brain. \nPneumococcal meningitis is fairly rare (less than 1 case per 100,000 people each year), but it leads to other health problems, including deafness and brain damage. In children, it is fatal in about 1 case out of 10.\nChildren younger than two are at higher risk for serious disease than older children. \n \nPeople with certain medical conditions, people over age 65, and cigarette smokers are also at higher risk.\nBefore vaccine, pneumococcal infections caused many problems each year in the United States in children younger than 5, including:\n\u2022\tmore than 700 cases of meningitis,\n\u2022\t13,000 blood infections,\n\u2022\tabout 5 million ear infections, and\n\u2022\tabout 200 deaths. \nAbout 4,000 adults still die each year because of \npneumococcal infections. \nPneumococcal infections can be hard to treat because \nsome strains are resistant to antibiotics. This makes prevention through vaccination even more important. 2 PCV13 vaccine\nThere are more than 90 types of pneumococcal bacteria. PCV13 protects against 13 of them. These 13 strains cause most severe infections in children and about half of infections in adults.\nPCV13 is routinely given to children at 2, 4, 6, and \n12\u201315 months of age. Children in this age range are at greatest risk for serious diseases caused by pneumococcal infection.\nPCV13 vaccine may also be recommended for some \nolder children or adults. Your doctor can give you details.\nA second type of pneumococcal vaccine, called PPSV23, \nmay also be given to some children and adults, including anyone over age 65. There is a separate Vaccine Information Statement for this vaccine.\n 3 Precautions\nAnyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a dose of this vaccine, to an earlier pneumococcal vaccine called PCV7 (or Prevnar), or to any vaccine containing diphtheria toxoid (for example, DTaP), should not get PCV13.\nAnyone with a severe allergy to any component of \nPCV13 should not get the vaccine.  Tell your doctor if the person being vaccinated has any severe allergies.\nIf the person scheduled for vaccination is sick, your \ndoctor might decide to reschedule the shot on another day.\nYour doctor can give you more information about any of \nthese precautions.  4  What are the risks of PCV13 \nvaccine?\nWith any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own, but serious reactions are also possible. \nReported problems associated with PCV13 vary by dose \nand age, but generally:\n\u2022\tAbout half of children became drowsy after the shot, \nhad a temporary loss of appetite, or had redness or tenderness where the shot was given.\n\u2022\tAbout 1 out of 3 had swelling where the shot was given.\n\u2022\tAbout 1 out of 3 had a mild fever, and about 1 in 20 had a higher fever (over 102.2\u00b0F).\n\u2022\tUp to about 8 out of 10 became fussy or irritable. \nAdults receiving the vaccine have reported redness, pain, and swelling where the shot was given. Mild fever, fatigue, headache, chills, or muscle pain have also been reported.\nLife-threatening allergic reactions from any vaccine are \nvery rare. \n 5  What if there is a serious reaction?\nWhat should I look for?\u2022\tLook for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. \n \nSigns of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, \nswelling\tof\tthe\tface\tand\tthroat,\tdifficulty\tbreathing, \t\na fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.\nWhat should I do?\u2022\tIf you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can\u2019t wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.\n\u2022\tAfterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). \nYour\tdoctor\tmight\tfile\tthis\treport,\tor\tyou\tcan\tdo\tit\t\nyourself through the V AERS web site at  www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967.\nVAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. 6  The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program\nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines.\nPersons who believe they may have been injured by a \nvaccine\tcan\tlearn\tabout\tthe\tprogram\tand\tabout\tfiling\ta\t\nclaim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP \nwebsite at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation.\n 7 How can I learn more?\n\u2022\tAsk your doctor.\n\u2022\tCall your local or state health department.\n\u2022\tContact the Centers for Disease Control and  \nPrevention (CDC): \n- Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO ) or \n- Visit CDC\u2019s website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines\n  Vaccine Information Statement (Interim)\n PCV13 Vaccine\n  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-262/27/2013Office Use OnlyHOJA DE INFORMACI\u00d3N SOBRE VACUNAS\nVacuna neumoc\u00f3cica conjugada\nLo que usted  \nnecesita saber\n1\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 vacunarse?\nSe recomienda la vacuna neumoc\u00f3cica conjugada \n(llamada PCV13 o Prevnar 13) para proteger a los \nlactantes y ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os, y a algunos ni\u00f1os m\u00e1s \ngrandes y adultos con determinadas afecciones de \nsalud contra la enfermedad neumoc\u00f3cica.\nLa enfermedad neumoc\u00f3cica se produce por \nuna infecci\u00f3n con las bacterias Streptococcus \npneumoniae .

Visite http://www.immunize.org/vis\n \n1 What is polio? \nPolio is a disease caused by a virus. It enters the \nbody through the mouth. Usually it does not cause serious illness. But sometimes it causes paralysis (can\u2019t move arm or leg), and it can cause meningitis (irritation of the lining of the brain). It can kill people who get it, usually by paralyzing the muscles that help them breathe. \nPolio used to be very common in the United \nStates. It paralyzed and killed thousands of people a year before we had a vaccine. \n2 Why get vaccinated? \nInactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) can prevent polio. \nHistory: A 1916 polio epidemic in the United \nStates killed 6,000 people and paralyzed 27,000 \nmore. In the early 1950\u2019s there were more than 25,000 cases of polio reported each year.  Polio vaccination was begun in 1955. By 1960 the number of reported cases had dropped to about 3,000, and by 1979 there were only about 10. The success of polio vaccination in the U.S. and other countries has sparked a world-wide effort to eliminate polio. \nToday: Polio has been eliminated from the \nUnited States. But the disease is still common in some parts of the world. It would only take one person infected with polio virus coming from another country to bring the disease back here if we were not protected by vaccine. If the effort to eliminate the disease from the world is successful, some day we won\u2019t need polio vaccine. Until then, we need to keep getting our children vaccinated. Who should get polio vaccine3 and when? \nIPV is a shot, given in the leg or arm, depending on age. It may be given at the same time as other \nvaccines. \nChildren \nChildren get 4 doses of IPV , at these ages: \u2022 A dose at 2 months \n\u2022 A dose at 4 months \n\u2022 A dose at 6-18 months \n\u2022 A booster dose at 4-6 years \nSome \u201ccombination\u201d vaccines (several different vaccines in the same shot) contain IPV .  Children getting these vaccines may get one more (5th) dose of polio vaccine. This is not a problem. \nAdults \nMost adults 18 and older do not need polio vaccine because they were vaccinated as children. But some adults are at higher risk and should consider polio vaccination: (1) people traveling to areas of the world where \npolio is common, \n(2) laboratory workers who might handle polio \n virus, and (3) health care workers treating patients who could have polio. \nAdults in these three groups: \n\u2022 who have never been vaccinated against  \npolio  should get 3 doses of IPV: \n-Two doses separated by 1 to 2 months, and \n-A third dose 6 to 12 months after the second. \n\u2022 who have had 1 or 2 doses of polio vaccine in \nthe past should get the remaining 1 or 2 doses. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n    \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n4 It doesn\u2019t matter how long it has been since  the earlier dose(s). \n\u2022 who have had 3 or more doses of polio vaccine in the past may get a booster dose of IPV . \nYour doctor can give you more information. \nSome people should not get IPV or should wait. \nThese people should not get IPV: \n\u2022 Anyone with a life-threatening allergy to any \ncomponent of IPV , including the antibiotics neomycin, streptomycin or polymyxin B, should not get polio vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. \n\u2022 Anyone who had a severe allergic reaction to a previous polio shot should not get another one. \nThese people should wait: \n\u2022 Anyone who is moderately or severely ill at \nthe time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting polio vaccine. People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. \nAsk your doctor for more information. \n5 What are the risks from IPV? \nSome people who get IPV get a sore spot where the shot was given. IPV  has not been known to cause serious problems, and most people don\u2019t have any problems at all with it. \nHowever, any medicine could cause a serious \nside effect, such as a severe allergic reaction or even death. The risk of polio vaccine causing serious harm is extremely small. \nWhat if there is a moderate or severe problem? \nWhat should I look for? \n\u2022 Look for any unusual condition, such as a \nserious allergic reaction, high fever, or \n unusual behavior. If a serious allergic reaction occurred, it would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. Signs of a serious allergic reac\u00adtion can include dif \ufb01culty breathing, weakness, \nhoarseness or wheezing, a fast heart beat, hives, dizziness, paleness, or swelling of the throat. \nWhat should I do? \n\u2022 Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor \n right away. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor what happened, the date and \ntime it happened, and when the vaccination \n was given. \n\u2022 Ask your doctor to report the reaction by \n\ufb01ling a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) form. \nOr you can \ufb01le this report through the V AERS \n website at www.vaers.hhs.gov  or by calling \n1-800-822-7967. \nVAERS does not provide medical advice. \nThe National Vaccine Injury 7 Compensation Program \nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation \nProgram (VICP) was created in 1986. \nPersons who believe they may have been \ninjured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about \ufb01ling a claim by calling \n1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. \n8 How can I learn more? \n\u2022 Ask your doctor.

Visite www.immunize.org/vis\n 1 Why get vaccinated?\nRotavirus is a virus that causes diarrhea, mostly in babies \nand young children. The diarrhea can be severe, and lead to dehydration. V omiting and fever are also common in babies with rotavirus.\nBefore rotavirus vaccine, rotavirus disease was a \ncommon and serious health problem for children in the United States. Almost all children in the U.S. had at least one rotavirus infection before their 5\nth birthday. \nEvery year:\u2022\tmore than 400,000 young children had to see a doctor for illness caused by rotavirus,\n\u2022\tmore than 200,000 had to go to the emergency room,\n\u2022\t55,000 to 70,000 had to be hospitalized, and\n\u2022\t20 to 60 died. \nRotavirus vaccine has been used since 2006 in the United States. Because children are protected by the vaccine, hospitalizations, and emergency visits for rotavirus have dropped dramatically.\n 2 Rotavirus vaccine\nTwo brands of rotavirus vaccine are available. Your baby will get either 2 or 3 doses, depending on which vaccine is used. \nDoses of rotavirus vaccine are recommended at these \nages:\n- First Dose:  2 months of age\n- Second Dose:  4 months of age\n- Third Dose:  6 months of age (if needed)\nRotavirus vaccine is a liquid that is swallowed, not a shot. \nRotavirus vaccine may safely be given at the same time \nas other vaccines.\nRotavirus vaccine is very good at preventing diarrhea \nand vomiting caused by rotavirus. Almost all babies who get rotavirus vaccine will be protected from severe\nrotavirus diarrhea. And most of these babies will not get rotavirus diarrhea at all. The vaccine will not prevent diarrhea or vomiting caused by other germs.Another virus called porcine circovirus (or parts of it) can be found in both rotavirus vaccines. This is not a virus that infects people, and there is no known \nsafety risk. For more information, see www.fda.gov/\nBiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/\nucm205547.htm.\n 3  Some babies should not get \nthis vaccine\n\u2022\tA baby who has had a severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a dose of rotavirus vaccine should not get another dose. \nA baby who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to \nany component of rotavirus vaccine should not get the vaccine.\nTell your doctor if your baby has any severe allergies \nthat you know of, including a severe allergy to latex.\n\u2022\t\nBabies\twith\t\u201csevere\tcombined \timmunodeficiency\u201d \t\n(SCID) should not get rotavirus vaccine.\n\u2022\tBabies who have had a type of bowel blockage called \n\u201cintussusception\u201d \tshould\tnot\tget\trotavirus\tvaccine.\n\u2022\tBabies who are mildly ill can probably get the vaccine today. Babies who are moderately or severely ill should probably wait until they recover. This includes babies with moderate or severe diarrhea or vomiting. \n\u2022\tCheck with your doctor if your baby\u2019s immune system is weakened because of:\n- HIV/AIDS, or any other disease that affects the \nimmune system\n- treatment with drugs such as long-term steroids- cancer, or cancer treatment with x-rays or drugs 4 Risks of a vaccine reaction\nWith a vaccine, like any medicine, there is a chance of \nside effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own.\nSerious side effects are also possible, but are very rare.Most babies who get rotavirus vaccine do not have \nany problems with it. But some problems have been associated with rotavirus vaccine:\nMild problems\nBabies might become irritable, or have mild, temporary diarrhea or vomiting after getting a dose of rotavirus vaccine.\nSerious problems\nIntussusception  is a type of bowel blockage that \nis treated in a hospital, and could require surgery. It \nhappens\t\u201cnaturally\u201d \tin\tsome\tbabies\tevery\tyear\tin\tthe\t\nUnited States, and usually there is no known reason for it. \nThere is also a small risk of intussusception from \nrotavirus vaccination, usually within a week after the 1\nst or 2nd vaccine dose. This additional risk is estimated \nto range from about 1 in 20,000 U.S. infants to 1 in 100,000 U.S. infants who get rotavirus vaccine. Your doctor can give you more information.\n 5  What if there is a  serious reaction?\nWhat should I look for?\u2022\tFor intussusception , look for signs of stomach pain \nalong with severe crying. Early on, these episodes could last just a few minutes and come and go several times in an hour. Babies might pull their legs up to their chest. \nYour baby might also vomit several times or have \nblood in the stool, or could appear weak or very irritable. These signs would usually happen during the \nfirst\tweek\tafter\tthe\t1st or 2nd dose of rotavirus vaccine, \nbut look for them any time after vaccination.\n\u2022\tLook for anything else that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.\nSigns of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, \nswelling\tof\tthe\tface\tand\tthroat,\tdifficulty\tbreathing, \t\na fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These \nwould start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.What should I do?\u2022\t\n If you think it is intussusception , call a doctor right \naway. If you can\u2019t reach your doctor, take your baby to a hospital. Tell them when your baby got the vaccine.\n\u2022\t\n If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other \nemergency that can\u2019t wait, call 9-1-1 or get your baby to the nearest hospital.\n\u2022\tAfterward, the reaction should be reported to \nthe\t\u201cVaccine\tAdverse \t Event \t Reporting \t System\u201d \t\n(VAERS). \tY our \t doctor \t might \t file \t this \t report, \t or \t you \t\ncan do it yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967.\nVAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice.\n 6  The National V accine Injury \nCompensation Program\nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines.\nPersons who believe they may have been injured by a \nvaccine\tcan\tlearn\tabout\tthe\tprogram\tand\tabout\tfiling\ta\t\nclaim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP \nwebsite at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation.\n 7 How can I learn more?\n\u2022\tAsk your doctor.\n\u2022\tCall your local or state health department.\n\u2022\tContact the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC):- Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO ) or\n- Visit CDC\u2019s website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines\n  Vaccine Information Statement (Interim)\n Rotavirus Vaccine\n  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-2608/26/2013Office Use OnlyHOJA DE INFORMACI\u00d3N SOBRE VACUNAS\nMuchas de las declaraciones informativas \nsobre vacunas est\u00e1n disponibles en espa\u00f1ol y otros idiomas.

La diarrea puede ser severa, y provoca deshidrataci\u00f3n. Los v\u00f3mitos y la fiebre tambi\u00e9n son comunes en beb\u00e9s con rotavirus.\nAntes de que existiera la vacuna, la enfermedad del \nrotavirus era un problema de salud grave y com\u00fan para los ni\u00f1os en los Estados Unidos. La mayor\u00eda de los ni\u00f1os en los Estados Unidos tuvo, al menos, una infecci\u00f3n por rotavirus antes de cumplir los 5 a\u00f1os. \nCada a\u00f1o: \n\u2022\tm\u00e1s de 400,000 ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os acudieron a un m\u00e9dico por enfermedades provocadas por el rotavirus,\n\u2022\tm\u00e1s de 200,000 acudieron a salas de emergencias,\n\u2022\tentre 55,000 y 70,000 fueron hospitalizados, y \n\u2022\tentre 20 y 60 murieron. \nLa vacuna contra el rotavirus es utilizada en los Estados Unidos desde el a\u00f1o 2006. Debido a que los ni\u00f1os est\u00e1n protegidos por la vacuna, las hospitalizaciones y las visitas de emergencia por rotavirus han disminuido considerablemente.\n 2 Vacuna contra el rotavirus\nHay dos marcas de vacunas contra el rotavirus disponibles. Su beb\u00e9 recibir\u00e1 2 o 3 dosis, seg\u00fan la vacuna que se utilice. \nSe recomiendan las dosis de la vacuna contra el rotavirus \nen estas edades:\n- Primera dosis: 2 meses de edad\n- Segunda dosis: 4 meses de edad\n- Tercera dosis: 6 meses de edad (si es necesario)\nLa vacuna contra el rotavirus es un l\u00edquido que se toma por v\u00eda oral, no una inyecci\u00f3n. \nLa vacuna contra el rotavirus puede administrarse en \nforma segura al mismo tiempo que otras vacunas.\nLa vacuna contra el rotavirus es muy eficaz para evitar la \ndiarrea y los v\u00f3mitos que provoca este virus. Casi todos \nlos beb\u00e9s que reciben esta vacuna estar\u00e1n protegidos \ncontra la diarrea severa provocada por el rotavirus. Y la \nmayor\u00eda de estos beb\u00e9s no tendr\u00e1n diarrea por rotavirus. \nLa vacuna no evitar\u00e1 la diarrea o los v\u00f3mitos provocados por otros g\u00e9rmenes.Otro virus llamado circovirus porcino (o algunas partes de este) se pueden encontrar en ambas vacunas contra el rotavirus. Este no es un virus que infecta a las personas, y no se conocen riesgos de seguridad.

Generalmente son leves y desaparecen por s\u00ed solos.\nTambi\u00e9n es posible que se produzcan efectos \nsecundarios graves, pero son muy poco frecuentes.\nLa mayor\u00eda de los beb\u00e9s que reciben la vacuna contra \nel rotavirus no tienen ning\u00fan tipo de problema con ella. Sin embargo, algunos problemas se han asociado con la vacuna contra el rotavirus:\nProblemas leves\nLos beb\u00e9s pueden presentar irritabilidad, o tener diarrea o v\u00f3mitos leves y temporales luego de recibir una dosis de la vacuna contra el rotavirus.\nProblemas graves\nLa invaginaci\u00f3n intestinal es un tipo de obstrucci\u00f3n intestinal que se trata en un hospital, y puede necesitar cirug\u00eda. Sucede \u201cnaturalmente\u201d en algunos beb\u00e9s cada a\u00f1o en los Estados Unidos, y en general no se conoce la raz\u00f3n por la cual se produce. \nExiste tambi\u00e9n un riesgo peque\u00f1o de invaginaci\u00f3n \nintestinal por la vacuna contra el rotavirus, generalmente la semana siguiente a la 1.\na o 2.a dosis de la vacuna. \nSe estima que este riesgo adicional oscila entre 1 en 20,000 beb\u00e9s y 1 en 100,000 beb\u00e9s estadounidenses que reciben la vacuna contra el rotavirus.

Up to 2 in 100 adolescents and 5 in 100 adults with pertussis are hospitalized or have complications, which could include pneumonia or death. \nThese diseases are caused by bacteria. Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing. Tetanus enters the body through cuts, scratches, or wounds.\nBefore vaccines, the United States saw as many as \n200,000 cases a year of diphtheria and pertussis, and hundreds of cases of tetanus. Since vaccination began, tetanus and diphtheria have dropped by about 99% and pertussis by about 80%.2 Tdap vaccine\nTdap vaccine can protect adolescents and adults from \ntetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. One dose of Tdap is routinely given at age 11 or 12. People who did not get Tdap at that age should get it as soon as possible.\nTdap is especially important for health care professionals \nand anyone having close contact with a baby younger than 12 months.\nPregnant women should get a dose of Tdap during every \npregnancy, to protect the newborn from pertussis. Infants are most at risk for severe, life-threatening complications from pertussis.\nA similar vaccine, called Td, protects from tetanus and \ndiphtheria, but not pertussis. A Td booster should be given every 10 years. Tdap may be given as one of these boosters if you have not already gotten a dose. Tdap may also be given after a severe cut or burn to prevent tetanus infection.\nYour doctor can give you more information.Tdap may safely be given at the same time as other \nvaccines.\n3  Some people should not get this vaccine\n\u2022\tIf you ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of any tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis containing vaccine, OR if you have a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, you should not get Tdap. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.\n\u2022\tIf you had a coma, or long or multiple seizures within 7 days after a childhood dose of DTP or DTaP, you should not get Tdap, unless a cause other than the vaccine was found. You can still get Td.\n\u2022\tTalk to your doctor if you:-  have epilepsy or another nervous system problem,-  had severe pain or swelling after any vaccine    containing diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis, -  ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS),-  aren\u2019t feeling well on the day the shot is scheduled.4 Risks of a vaccine reaction\nWith any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance \nof side effects. These are usually mild and go away on \ntheir own, but serious reactions are also possible.\nBrief fainting spells can follow a vaccination, leading \nto injuries from falling. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent these. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy or light-headed, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.\nMild problems  following Tdap\n(Did not interfere with activities)\u2022\tPain where the shot was given (about 3 in 4 \nadolescents or 2 in 3 adults)\n\u2022\tRedness or swelling where the shot was given (about \n1 person in 5)\n\u2022\tMild fever of at least 100.4\u00b0F (up to about 1 in \n25 adolescents or 1 in 100 adults)\n\u2022\tHeadache (about 3 or 4 people in 10)\n\u2022\tTiredness (about 1 person in 3 or 4)\n\u2022\tNausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache (up to 1 in \n4 adolescents or 1 in 10 adults)\n\u2022\tChills, body aches, sore joints, rash, swollen glands (uncommon)\nModerate problems following Tdap\n(Interfered with activities, but did not require medical \nattention)\n\u2022\tPain where the shot was given (about 1 in \n5 adolescents or 1 in 100 adults) \n\u2022\tRedness or swelling where the shot was given (up to \nabout 1 in 16 adolescents or 1 in 25 adults)\n\u2022\tFever over 102\u00b0F (about 1 in 100 adolescents or 1 in 250 adults)\n\u2022\tHeadache (about 3 in 20 adolescents or 1 in 10 adults)\n\u2022\tNausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache (up to 1 or \n3 people in 100)\n\u2022\tSwelling of the entire arm where the shot was given (up to about 3 in 100).\nSevere problems  following Tdap\n(Unable to perform usual activities; required medical attention)\n\u2022\tSwelling, severe pain, bleeding and redness in the arm \nwhere the shot was given (rare).\nA severe allergic reaction could occur after any vaccine (estimated less than 1 in a million doses). 5  What if there is a serious reaction?\nWhat should I look for?\n\u2022\tLook for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.\nSigns of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, \nswelling\tof\tthe\tface\tand\tthroat,\tdifficulty\tbreathing, \t\na fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These \nwould start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.\nWhat should I do?\n\u2022\tIf you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other \nemergency that can\u2019t wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.\n\u2022\tAfterward, the reaction should be reported to the \u201cVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System\u201d (V AERS). \nYour\tdoctor\tmight\tfile\tthis\treport,\tor\tyou\tcan\tdo\t\nit yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967.\nVAERS is only for reporting reactions.

the Immunization Action Coalition\n                              \n CHICKENPOX VACCINE\nW H A T Y O U   N E E D  T O   K N O W\nMany Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis. \n1Why get vaccinated? \nChickenpox (also called varicella) is a common \nchildhood disease. It is usually mild, but it can be serious, especially in young infants and adults. \n\u2022\tIt causes a rash, itching, fever, and tiredness. \n\u2022\tIt can lead to severe skin infection, scars, \npneumonia, brain damage, or death. \n\u2022\tThe chickenpox virus can be spread from person to person through the air, or by contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters. \n\u2022\tA person who has had chickenpox can get a painful rash called shingles years later. \n\u2022\tBefore the vaccine, about 11,000 people were hospitalized for chickenpox each year in the United States. \n\u2022\tBefore the vaccine, about 100 people died each year as a result of chickenpox in the United States. \nChickenpox vaccine can prevent chickenpox. \nMost people who get chickenpox vaccine will not get \nchickenpox. But if someone who has been vaccinated \ndoes get chickenpox, it is usually very mild. They will have fewer blisters, are less likely to have a fever, and will recover faster. \n2Who should get chickenpox\nvaccine and when? \nRoutine \nChildren who have never had chickenpox should get 2 \ndoses of chickenpox vaccine at these ages: \n1st Dose: \t 12-15 months of age \n2nd Dose:\t 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, \nif at least 3 months after the 1st dose) \nPeople 13 years of age and older (who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine) should get two doses at least 28 days apart. \n \t \nCatch-Up \nAnyone who is not fully vaccinated, and never had chickenpox, should receive one or two doses of chickenpox vaccine. The timing of these doses \ndepends on the person\u2019s age.  Ask your provider. \nChickenpox vaccine may be given at the same time \nas other vaccines. \nNote: A \u201ccombination\u201d vaccine called MMRV, \nwhich contains both chickenpox and MMR vac\u00ad\ncines, may be given instead of the two individual \nvaccines to people 12 years of age and younger. \nSome people should not get\nchickenpox vaccine or should wait 3 \n\u2022\tPeople should not get chickenpox vaccine if they \nhave ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of chickenpox vaccine or to \ngelatin or the antibiotic neomycin. \n\u2022\tPeople who are moderately or severely ill at the \ntime the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting chickenpox \nvaccine. \n\u2022\tPregnant women should wait to get chickenpox \nvaccine until after they have given birth. Women should not get pregnant for 1 month after getting \nchickenpox vaccine. \n\u2022\tSome people should check with their doctor about \nwhether they should get chickenpox vaccine, including anyone who: \n-Has HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system \n-Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids, for 2 weeks or longer \n-Has any kind of cancer \n-Is getting cancer treatment with radiation or drugs \n\u2022\tPeople who recently had a transfusion or were given other blood products should ask their doctor when they may get chickenpox vaccine. \nAsk your provider for more information. Chickenpox 3/13/08                4 What are the risks from \nchickenpox vaccine? \nA vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing \nserious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of chickenpox vaccine causing serious harm, \nor death, is extremely small. \nGetting chickenpox vaccine is much safer than \ngetting chickenpox disease. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine do not have any problems with it. Reactions are usually more likely after the first dose \nthan after the second. \nMild Problems \n\u2022\tSoreness or swelling where the shot was given \n(about 1 out of 5 children and up to 1 out of 3 adolescents and adults) \n\u2022\tFever (1 person out of 10, or less) \n\u2022\tMild rash, up to a month after vaccination (1 person out of 25). It is possible for these people to infect other members of their household, but this \nis extremely rare. \nModerate Problems \n\u2022\tSeizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (very \nrare). \nSevere Problems \n\u2022\tPneumonia (very rare) \nOther serious problems, including severe brain reac\u00adtions and low blood count, have been reported after chickenpox vaccination. These happen so rarely \nexperts cannot tell whether they are caused by the \nvaccine or not. If they are, it is extremely rare. \nNote: The first dose of MMRV vaccine \nhas been associated with rash and higher \nrates of fever than MMR and varicella \nvaccines given separately. Rash has been \nreported in about 1 person in 20 and fever in about 1 person in 5. Seizures caused by a fever are also reported more often after MMR V . These usually \noccur 5-12 days after the first dose. \n5What if there is a moderate or\nsevere reaction?\nWhat should I look for? \n\u2022 Any unusual condition, such as a high fever, \nweakness, or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. \nWhat should I do? \n\u2022 Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right \naway. \n\u2022 T ell your doctor what happened, the date and time \nit happened, and when the vaccination was given. \n\u2022 Ask your provider to report the reaction by filing a \nVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. \nOr you can file this report through the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. \nVAERS does not provide medical advice. \nThe National Vaccine Injury\nCompensation Program 6 \nA federal program has been created to help people \nwho may have been harmed by a vaccine. \nFor details about the National Vaccine Injury \nCompensation Program, call 1-800-338-2382 or visit \ntheir website at \nwww.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. \nHow can I learn more?7 \n\u2022 Ask your provider. \tThey can give you the \nvaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information. \n\u2022 Call your local or state health department. \n\u2022 Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): \n-Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO) \n-Visit CDC website at: www.cdc.gov/vaccines \nddeeppaarrttmmeennttooffhheeaalltthhaannddhhuummaannsseerrvviicceess\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention \nVaccine Information Statement (Interim)\nVaricella Vaccine (3/13/08)\n  \n 42 U.S.C. \u00a7300aa-26\n      \u00bfQui\u00e9nes deben vacunarse \ncontra la varicela y cu\u00e1ndo?2\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 vacunarse?1\nRutina\nLos ni\u00f1os que nunca tuvieron varicela deben recibir 2 dosis \nde la vacuna contra la varicela a las siguientes edades:\n1a dosis:    12 a 15 meses de edad\n2a dosis:    4 a 6 a\u00f1os de edad (se puede dar antes, \npero tiene que ser al menos 3 meses \ndespu\u00e9s de la la dosis)\nLas personas de 13 a\u00f1os de edad o mayores (que nunca \ntuvieron varicela ni se vacunaron contra la varicela) deben \nrecibir dos dosis, la segunda al menos 28 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de \nla primera.\nVacuna para ponerse al d\u00eda\nCualquier persona que no est\u00e9 completamente vacunada y \nque nunca tuvo varicela, debe recibir una o dos dosis de la L O  Q U E  U S T E D  N E C E S I TA S A B E RVACun A COnTRA LA VARICELA\nMuchas de las hojas informativas sobre vacunas est\u00e1n disponibles en espa\u00f1ol y en otros idiomas.

Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\nThis VIS tells you about the benefits and risks of \nsix routine childhood vaccines. It also contains information about reporting an adverse reaction and about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and how to get more information about vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases. (Individual VISs are also available for these vaccines.)\nHow vaccines work\nImmunity from disease: When children get sick with an infectious disease, their immune system usually produces protective \u201cantibodies, \u201d which keep them from getting the same disease again. But getting sick is no fun, and it can be dangerous or even fatal.\nImmunity from vaccines: Vaccines are made with \nthe same bacteria or viruses that cause disease, but they have been weakened or killed\u2014or only parts of them are used\u2014to make them safe. A child\u2019s immune system produces antibodies, just as it would after exposure to the actual disease. This means the child will develop immunity in the same way, but without having to get sick first.Vaccine benefits: why get vaccinated?\nDiseases have injured and killed many children over the years in the United States. Polio  paralyzed about \n37,000 and killed about 1,700 every year in the 1950s. Hib disease was once the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children under 5 years of age. About 15,000 people died each year from diphtheria before there was a vaccine. Up to 70,000 children a year were hospitalized because of rotavirus disease. \nHepatitis  B \ncan cause liver damage and cancer in 1 child out of 4 who are infected, and tetanus kills 1 out of every 5 who get it.\nThanks mostly to vaccines, these diseases are not \nnearly as common as they used to be. But they have not disappeared, either. Some are common in other countries, and if we stop vaccinating they will come back here. This has already happened in some parts of the world. When vaccination rates go down, disease rates go up. Childhood vaccines can prevent these 8 Diseases\n1. DIPHTHERIA\nSigns and symptoms include a thick covering in the back of the throat that can make it hard to breathe.\nDiphtheria can lead to breathing problems, and heart failure.\n2. TETANUS (Lockjaw)\nSigns and symptoms include painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body.\nTetanus can lead to stiffness of the jaw so victims can\u2019t open their mouth or swallow.\n3. PERTUSSIS (Whooping Cough)\nSigns and symptoms include violent coughing spells that can make it hard for a baby to eat, drink, or breathe. These \nspells can last for weeks.\nPertussis can lead to pneumonia, seizures, and brain damage.\n4. HIB (Haemophilus influenzae type b)\nSigns and symptoms can include trouble breathing. There may not be any signs or symptoms in mild cases.\nHib can lead to meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord coverings); pneumonia; infections of the blood, \njoints, bones, and covering of the heart; brain damage; and deafness.\n5. HEPATITIS B\nSigns and symptoms can include tiredness, diarrhea and vomiting, jaundice (yellow skin or eyes), and pain in \nmuscles, joints and stomach. But usually there are no signs or symptoms at all.\nHepatitis B can lead to liver damage, and liver cancer.\n6. POLIO\nSigns and symptoms can include flu-like illness, or there may be no signs or symptoms at all.\nPolio can lead to paralysis (can\u2019t move an arm or leg).\n7. PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE\nSigns and symptoms include fever, chills, cough, and chest pain.\nPneumococcal disease can lead to meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord coverings), blood infections, ear \ninfections, pneumonia, deafness, and brain damage.\n8. ROTAVIRUS\nSigns and symptoms include watery diarrhea (sometimes severe), vomiting, fever, and stomach pain.\nRotavirus can lead to dehydration and hospitalization.\nAny of these diseases can lead to death.\nHow do babies catch these diseases?\nUsually from contact with other children or adults who are already infected, sometimes without even knowing they \nare infected. A mother with Hepatitis B infection can also infect her baby at birth. Tetanus enters the body through a cut or wound; it is not spread from person to person.Routine baby vaccines\nVaccine Number of \ndosesRecommended ages Other information\nDTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis)5\n2 months, 4 months, 6\u00a0months, \n15\u201318 months, 4\u20136\u00a0yearsSome children should not get pertussis vaccine. These \nchildren can get a vaccine called DT.\nHepatitis B 3 Birth, 1\u20132 months,  \n6\u201318 monthsChildren may get an additional dose at 4 months with \nsome \u201ccombination\u201d vaccines.\nPolio 4 2 months, 4 months,  \n6\u201318 months, 4\u20136 years\nHib ( Haemophilus \ninfluenzae type b)3 or 4 2 months, 4 months,  (6 months), 12\u201315 months There are 2 types of Hib vaccine. With one type the \n6-month dose is not needed.\nPCV13 \n(pneumococcal)4 2 months, 4 months,  6 months, 12\u201315 months Older children with certain chronic diseases may also \nneed this vaccine.\nRotavirus 2 or 3 2 months, 4 months,  \n(6 months)Not a shot, but drops that are swallowed.  \nThere are 2 types of rotavirus vaccine. With one type the 6-month dose is not needed. \nAnnual flu vaccination is also recommended for children 6 months of age and older.\nPrecautions\nMost babies can safely get all of these vaccines. But some babies should not get certain vaccines. Y our doctor will help you decide.\n\u2022\tA child who has ever had a serious reaction, such as a life-threatening allergic reaction, after a vaccine dose should \nnot get another dose of that vaccine. Tell your doctor if your child has any severe allergies, or has had a severe reaction after a prior vaccination . (Serious reactions to vaccines and severe allergies are rare.)\n\u2022\tA child who is sick on the day vaccinations are scheduled might be asked to come back for them.\nTalk to your doctor\u2026\n\u2022\tbefore getting DTaP vaccine, if your child ever had any of these reactions after a dose of DTaP:\n- A brain or nervous system disease within 7 days,- Non-stop crying for 3 hours or more,- A seizure or collapse,- A fever of over 105\u00b0F.\n\u2022\tbefore getting Polio vaccine , if your child has a life-threatening allergy to the antibiotics neomycin, streptomycin or \npolymyxin B.\n\u2022\tbefore getting Hepatitis B vaccine, if your child has a life-threatening allergy to yeast.\n\u2022\tbefore getting Rotavirus Vaccine, if your child has:\n- SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency),- A weakened immune system for any other reason,- Digestive problems,- Recently gotten a blood transfusion or other blood product,- Ever had intussusception (bowel obstruction that is treated in a hospital).\n\u2022\tbefore getting PCV13 or DTaP vaccine, if your child ever had a severe reaction after any vaccine containing \ndiphtheria toxoid (such as DTaP).Risks\nVaccines can cause side effects, like any medicine. \nMost vaccine reactions are mild: tenderness, redness, \nor swelling where the shot was given; or a mild fever. These happen to about 1 child in 4. They appear soon after the shot is given and go away within a day or two.\nOther reactions: Individual childhood vaccines have \nbeen associated with other mild problems, or with moderate or serious problems:\nDTaP vaccine\nMild problems: Fussiness (up to 1 child in 3); tiredness or poor appetite (up to 1 child in 10); vomiting (up to 1 child in 50); swelling of the entire arm or leg for 1\u20137 days (up to 1 child in 30)\u2014usually after the 4th or 5th dose.\nModerate problems: Seizure (1 child in 14,000); \nnon-stop crying for 3 hours or longer (up to 1 child in 1,000); fever over 105\u00b0F (1 child in 16,000).\nSerious problems: Long term seizures, coma, lowered \nconsciousness, and permanent brain damage have been reported. These problems happen so rarely that it is hard to tell whether they were actually caused by the vaccination or just happened afterward by chance.Polio vaccine / Hepatitis B vaccine / Hib vaccine\nThese vaccines have not been associated with other mild problems, or with moderate or serious problems.\nPneumococcal vaccine\nMild problems: During studies of the vaccine, some children became fussy or drowsy or lost their appetite.\nRotavirus vaccine\nMild problems: Children who get rotavirus vaccine are slightly more likely than other children to be irritable or to have mild, temporary diarrhea or vomiting. This happens within the first week after getting a dose of the vaccine. \nSerious problems: Studies in Australia and Mexico \nhave shown a small increase in cases of intussusception within a week after the first dose of rotavirus vaccine. So far, this increase has not been seen in the United States, but it can\u2019t be ruled out. If the same risk were to exist here, we would expect to see 1 to 3 infants out of 100,000 develop intussusception within a week after the first dose of vaccine.\nWhat if there is a serious reaction?\nWhat should I look for?\n\u2022\tLook for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. \n \nSigns of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.\nWhat should I do?\n\u2022\tIf you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can\u2019t wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.\n\u2022\tAfterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). Y our doctor might file this report, or you can  do it yourself through the V AERS web site at  www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967.\nVAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice.The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program\nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines.\nPersons who believe they may have been injured by a \nvaccine can learn about the program and about filing a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation.\nFor more information\n\u2022\tAsk your doctor.\n\u2022\tCall your local or state health department.\n\u2022\tContact the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC): - Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO) or  \n- Visit CDC\u2019s website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines\n  Vaccine Information Statement (Interim)\n \n  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-2611/16/2012Office Use OnlyEstas vacunas protegen a su beb\u00e9 \nde 8 enfermedades graves: - Difteria.- T\u00e9tanos.- Pertussis (tos ferina).-  Haemophilus influenzae tipo b \n(Hib).\n- Hepatitis B.- Poliomielitis. - Rotavirus.- Enfermedad neumoc\u00f3cica.\nACERCA DE ESTA HOJA DE INFORMACI\u00d3N SOBRE VACUNAS\nLea esta Hoja de informaci\u00f3n sobre vacunas (Vaccine Information Statement, VIS) antes de que su beb\u00e9 reciba \nsus inmunizaciones y despu\u00e9s, ll\u00e9vesela a su casa.

(Para estas vacunas, tambi\u00e9n hay disponibles VIS individuales).\nC\u00d3MO FUNCIONAN LAS VACUNAS\nInmunidad por las enfermedades: Cuando los ni\u00f1os contraen una enfermedad infecciosa, su sistema \ninmunitario, con frecuencia, produce \u201canticuerpos\u201d protectores que impiden que contraigan la misma \nenfermedad nuevamente. Pero enfermarse no es divertido; puede ser peligroso o incluso mortal.\nInmunidad por las vacunas: Las vacunas est\u00e1n hechas con las mismas bacterias o virus que provocan la \nenfermedad en cuesti\u00f3n, pero estos han sido debilitados o destruidos, o solo se han utilizado partes de ellos, \npara hacerlos seguros. El sistema inmunitario de un ni\u00f1o produce anticuerpos, tal como suceder\u00eda despu\u00e9s de la \nexposici\u00f3n a la enfermedad real. Esto significa que el ni\u00f1o desarrollar\u00e1 inmunidad de la misma manera, pero sin tener que enfermarse primero.\nBENEFICIOS DE LAS VACUNAS: \u00bfPOR QU\u00c9 VACUNARSE?\nA lo largo de los a\u00f1os, muchos ni\u00f1os han tenido lesiones o han muerto a causa de enfermedades en los  \nEstados Unidos. En los a\u00f1os cincuenta, la poliomielitis provocaba par\u00e1lisis en alrededor de 37,000 personas  \ny produc\u00eda la muerte de alrededor de 1700 todos los a\u00f1os. La enfermedad Hib era la causa principal de \nmeningitis bacteriana en ni\u00f1os menores de 5 a\u00f1os. Antes de que hubiera una vacuna, alrededor de 15,000 personas mor\u00edan de difteria todos los a\u00f1os. Hasta 70,000 ni\u00f1os por a\u00f1o eran hospitalizados debido a la \nenfermedad por rotavirus. La hepatitis B puede provocar da\u00f1o hep\u00e1tico y c\u00e1ncer en 1 de cada 4 ni\u00f1os que \nest\u00e1n infectados y el t\u00e9tanos mata a 1 de cada 5 ni\u00f1os que lo contraen.\nGracias a las vacunas principalmente, estas enfermedades no son, ni con mucho, lo comunes que sol\u00edan ser. \nPero tampoco han desaparecido. Algunas son comunes en otros pa\u00edses y, si dejamos de aplicar vacunas contra \nestas, regresar\u00e1n aqu\u00ed. Esto ya ha sucedido en algunas partes del mundo. Cuando las tasas de vacunaci\u00f3n bajan, \nlas tasas de enfermedades suben.HOJA DE INFORMACI\u00d3N SOBRE VACUNAS\nLas primeras vacunas de su beb\u00e9\nLo que usted necesita saberMuchas de las Hojas informativas sobre vacunas \nest\u00e1n disponibles en espa\u00f1ol y en otros idiomas. \nVisite www.immunize.org/vis.\nLas Hojas de informaci\u00f3n sobre vacunas est\u00e1n \ndisponibles en espa\u00f1ol y en muchos otros idiomas. \nVisite http://www.immunize.org/vis.\nOffice Use \nOnly\nMulti-vaccine VIS \u2013 Spanish\n(11/16/2012) p. 1 of 4Su beb\u00e9 recibir\u00e1 estas vacunas hoy:\n(Proveedor: marque las casillas que correspondan).\nConsulte a su m\u00e9dico acerca de las \u201cvacunas combinadas\u201d, que \npueden reducir la cantidad de inyecciones que su beb\u00e9 necesita.\nLas vacunas combinadas son igual de seguras y efectivas que las \nvacunas que se aplican por separado.

What should I do?\nCheck your child\u2019s temperature to find out if there is a fever. An easy way \nto do this is by taking a temperature in the armpit using an electronic ther -\nmometer (or by using the method of temperature-taking your healthcare \nprovider recommends). If your child has a temperature that your healthcare  \nprovider has told you to be concerned about or if you have questions, call \nyour healthcare provider.\nHere are some things you can do to help reduce fever:\nn Give your child plenty to drink.\nn Dress your child lightly. Do not cover or wrap your child tightly.\nn  Give your child a fever- or pain-reducing medicine such as acetamino -\nphen (e.g., Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Advil, Motrin). The dose you give \nyour child should be based on your child\u2019s weight and your heathcare \nprovider\u2019s instructions. See the dose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin.  \nRecheck your child\u2019s temperature after 1 hour. Call your healthcare  \nprovider if you have questions.\nMy child has been fussy since getting vaccinated. What should \nI do?\nAfter vaccination, children may be fussy because of pain or fever. To reduce \ndiscomfort, you may want to give your child a medicine such as acetami n-\nophen or ibuprofen. See the dose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin.   \nIf your child is fussy for more than 24 hours, call your healthcare provider.\nMy child\u2019s leg or arm is swollen, hot, and red. What should I do?\nn Apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the sore area for comfort.\nn  For pain, give a medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. See the \ndose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin.\nn  If the redness or tenderness increases after 24 hours, call your healthcare \nprovider. \nMy child seems really sick.

Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist which medicine is best for your child.\n 2.   Give the dose based on your child\u2019s weight. If you don\u2019t know your child\u2019s weight, give the dose based  on your \nchild\u2019s age. Do not give more medicine than is recommended.\n 3.   If you have questions about dosage amounts or any other concerns, call your healthcare provider.\n 4.   Always use a proper measuring device. For example:  \n\u25a0  When giving acetaminophen liquid (e.g., Tylenol), use the device enclosed in the package. If you misplace the \ndevice, consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist for advice. Kitchen spoons are not accurate measures.\n  \u25a0 When giving ibuprofen liquid (e.g., Advil, Motrin), use the device enclosed in the package. Never use  \n     a kitchen spoon!\nTake these two steps to avoid causing a serious medication overdose in your child.\n 1.   Don\u2019t give your child a larger amount of acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Motrin, Advil) than \nis shown in the table below. Too much of any of these medicines can cause an overdose. \n 2.   When you give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen, don\u2019t also give them over-the-counter (OTC) cough \nor cold medicines. This can also cause a medication overdose because cough and cold medicines  often con -\ntain acetaminophen or ibuprofen. In fact, to be safe, don\u2019t give OTC cough and cold medicines to your child \nunless you talk to your child\u2019s healthcare  provider first.Medicines and Dosages to Reduce Pain and Fever\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol or another brand): How much to give? \nGive every 4 to 6 hours, as needed, no more than 5 times in 24 hours (unless directed to do otherwise by your healthcare provider).\nIbuprofen (Advil, Motrin, or another brand): How much to give?\nGive every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, no more than 4 times in 24 hours (unless directed to do otherwise by your healthcare provider).\nImmunization Action Coalition  n www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4015.pdf * healthcare provider:  please fill in the advised dose.after the shots: what to do if your child has discomfort \u2013 page 2\nold formulations infants\u2019 new formulation \nchildren\u2019s\nchewables or\njunior tabletsor in each 1.0 mL\nold formulation\nproduct\ndiscontinued by\nmanufacturersproduct\ndiscontinued by\nmanufacturers\npage 2 of 2 1 / FDA Consumer Health Information / U.S. Food and Drug Administration  DECEMBER 2011\nConsumer Health Information\nwww.fda.gov/consumer\nThe Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) is urging consumers to \ncarefully read the labels of liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants to avoid giving the wrong dose to their children.Know Concentration Before Giving Acetaminophen to Infants\nA less concentrated form of the \npopular medication is arriving on \nstore shelves, and giving the wrong dose of acetaminophen can cause the medication to be ineffective if too little is given or cause serious side effects and, possibly, death if too much is given. \nIn an attempt to reduce the confu -\nsion over different strengths that have been blamed for past overdoses, some manufacturers are voluntarily offer -\ning only the less concentrated version for all children.\nUntil now, liquid acetaminophen \nmarketed for infants has only been available in a stronger concentration that doesn\u2019t require giving the infants as much liquid with each dose.\nBut right now both concentrations \nof liquid acetaminophen are in cir -\nculation. Before giving the medica -\ntion, parents and caregivers need to know whether they have the less con -\ncentrated version or the older, more concentrated medication. FDA is con -\ncerned that infants could be given too much or too little of the medicine if the different concentrations of acet -\naminophen are confused. \n\u201cBe very careful when you\u2019re giving \nyour infant acetaminophen\u201d says Carol Holquist, director of FDA\u2019s Division of Medical Error Prevention and Analysis.\nHere\u2019s what the agency wants par -\nents and caregivers to do:\u2022  Read the Drug Facts label on the \npackage very carefully to identify the concentration of the liquid acetaminophen, the correct dosage, and the directions for use. \n\u2022  Do not depend on a banner \nproclaiming that the product is \u201cnew.\u201d Some medicines with the old concentration also have this headline on their packaging.\n\u2022  Use only the dosing device \nprovided with the purchased product in order to correctly measure the right amount of liquid acetaminophen.  \n\u2022  Consult your pediatrician before \ngiving this medication and make sure you\u2019re both talking about the same concentration.\n \nOverdosing Has Been a Risk\nAn April 2011 report from FDA\u2019s Cen -\nter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) found that confusion caused by the different concentrations of liq -\nuid acetaminophen for infants and children was leading to overdoses that made infants seriously ill, with some dying from liver failure. \nSo to avoid dosing errors, some \nmanufacturers voluntarily changed the liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants from 80 mg per 0.8mL or 80 mg per 1 mL to be the same con -\ncentration as the liquid acetamino -\nphen marketed for children\u2014160 mg per 5mL. This less concentrated liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants now has new dosing directions and \n2 / FDA Consumer Health Information / U.S. Food and Drug Administration  DECEMBER 2 011\nConsumer Health Information\nwww.fda.gov/consumer\nFind this and other Consumer \nUpdates at www.fda.gov/\nForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates\n  Sign up for free e-mail \nsubscriptions at www.fda.gov/\nconsumer/consumerenews.htmlmay have a new dosing device in the \nbox, such as an oral syringe. \nBut this is a voluntary change and \nsome of the older, stronger concen -\ntrations of acetaminophen marketed \nfor infants are still available and may remain available. \n\u201cThere is still some on store shelves; \nthere is still some in homes; and there is still some in distribution,\u201d says Holquist.\nWhy does this pose a danger? \nIf a pediatrician prescribes a 5 mL dose of the less concentrated liq -\nuid acetaminophen, but the parents administer a 5 mL dose of the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen, the child can receive a potentially fatal overdose during the course of therapy, Holquist explains. \nConversely, if a physician pre -\nscribes a dose based on the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen and the less concentrated medication is used, the child might not receive enough medication to fight a fever, she says.\nFDA has issued a Drug Safety \nCommunication ( www.fda.gov/Drugs/  \nDrugSafety/ucm284741.htm ) with more \ninformation for consumers about how to avoid confusion and potential dosing errors with the different con -\ncentrations of liquid acetaminophen. What Should You Do?\nAdding to the confusion is the fact that that the box and the bottle may look much the same for both old and new versions of the medication, Holquist says. \nRead the Drug Facts label to tell \nthe difference between the two liquid acetaminophen products:\n\u2022  Look for the \u201cActive ingredient\u201d \nsection of the Drug Facts label usually printed on the back of an over-the-counter medication package.  \n\u2022  If the package says \u201c160 mg per 5 \nmL\u201d or \u201c160 mg (in each 5 mL)\u201d, then this is the less concentrated liquid acetaminophen.  This medication should come with an oral syringe to help you measure the dose.\n\u2022  If the package says \u201c80 mg per 0.8 \nmL\u201d or \u201c80 mg per 1 mL,\u201d then this is the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen. This product may come with a dropper.\nIf the dosing instructions provided by your healthcare provider differ from what is on the label, check with a healthcare professional before admin -\nistering the medication.  Do not rely on dosing information provided from other sources such as the Internet, old dosing charts, or family members.It is important to understand that \nthere is no dosing amount specified for children younger than 2 years of age.  If you have an infant or child younger than 2 years old, always check with your healthcare provider for dosing instructions.  \nAcetaminophen is marketed for \ninfants under brand names such as Little Fevers Infant Fever/Pain Reliever, Pedia Care Fever Reducer Pain Reliever and Triaminic Infants\u2019 Syrup Fever Reducer Pain Reliever. There are also store brands on the shelves. \u201cBe very careful when you\u2019re giving your infant acetaminophen.\u201d\nDespu\u00e9s de \nlas vacunas...\nEs posible que su hijo necesite mucho amor y \natenci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de que lo vacunen.

Too much of any of these medicines can cause an overdose. \n2.When you give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen, don\u2019t also give them over-the-counter (OTC)\ncough or cold medicines. This can also cause a medication overdose because cough and cold medicinesoften contain acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

As a new parent \n(or parent-to-be), it\u2019s hard not to hear the great debate in parenting \ncircles these days\u2014do vaccines cause autism? If not, what causes \nautism and why is it on the rise?\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning\u2014just what is autism?\nQ: What is autism?\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is really a collection of several \ndisorders that have three abnormal areas in common: social skills, \ncommunication skills, and repetitive or obsessive traits. Specialists \nuse the terms ASD and Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) \ninterchangeably. To add even more confusion, Pervasive Devel -\nopmental Disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and As -\nperger\u2019s Syndrome also are other categories that fall under the ASD \numbrella.\nThere is a very broad range of severity within ASD. A child may \nhave normal intelligence and language, but be socially awkward \nand have panic attacks if his sandwich is cut in triangles instead of \nsquares. Or a child may appear out of touch with reality and spend \nhis entire day rocking and flapping his hands. Both children have \nASD. As you might suspect, children with severe problems as in \nclassic autism are diagnosed much earlier than kids who can com -\nmunicate but have trouble with social skills, as in Asperger\u2019s Syn -\ndrome.\nChildren are usually diagnosed by 18-24 months of age when lan -\nguage delays are obvious. Many children with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome \nmay not be diagnosed until preschool (or sometimes even later).\nHowever, clues to the diagnosis appear long before that time. Some \nearly clues include: not smiling back at people, poor eye contact, not \nimitating, not gesturing (waving bye-bye), not responding to being \ncalled by name, and not trying to communicate/connect/engage with \nother people by 1 year of age.\nThere also are some unusual behaviors. Cuddling may not be sooth -\ning. In fact, an autistic child may get very upset by being touched. \nBright lights and noises often bother them. Because they are bugged \nby the outside world, they may turn inward and find comfort in re -\npetitive behaviors (rocking, head banging, spinning). Autistic chil -dren may have little interest in playing with toys. Or they may play \nin an odd way\u2014 such as using a phone as a comfort object.\nBottom line:  Children with autism have autism long before their \nfirst birthdays, even though their \u201cofficial\u201d diagnosis usually occurs \nin their second year of life.\nQ: I have a friend whose child has autism. She said \nhe was \u201cperfectly normal\u201d until he was about  \n18 months old. Does this happen?\nA small minority of ASD children have completely normal mile -\nstones and then regress, which is known as \u201clate onset autism.\u201d \nThese children most likely have a distinct genetic abnormality that \nturns on or off without any trigger.\nHowever, for most kids with ASD, parents and doctors just miss (or \ndismiss) the early signs in the first year of life and the child\u2019s atypi -\ncal development only becomes apparent at 18 months.\nDoctors rely heavily on parents to point out concerns. And parents \n(especially first-timers) don\u2019t know what is normal and what isn\u2019t.\nThe mother of one of my ASD patients told me that she only real -\nized how unusual her son\u2019s development was after she watched her \nsecond child, without ASD, breeze through her milestones. Even the \nmost vocal ASD mom of all, Jenny McCarthy, agrees. Her son was \n5 months old when he first smiled at her (that\u2019s abnormal), when \nall of her friends\u2019 babies smiled at 2 months of age (that\u2019s normal).\nSome parents report that their ASD child spoke a few words and \nthen \u201clost\u201d the ability to say them. If you delve a bit deeper, the child \nmay have randomly said a few things, but was not consistently using \nwords like \u201cjuice\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to communicate his needs.\nThere is growing research in language development that looks at \nbrain anatomy. Primitive brain parts control early language develop -\nment from birth to 18 months. At 18 to 24 months, the mature brain \nparts turn on and language takes off. With autistic children, mature \nlanguage does not take off. But from a parent\u2019s perspective, it may \nlook like a loss of skills. Clear Answers & Smart Advice \nAbout Your Baby\u2019s Shots\nDr. Brown received her medical degree from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas; she did her \npediatric residency at Harvard Medical School/Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. In private practice since 1995, \nDr. Brown is perhaps best known as the coauthor of the 411 parenting book series \u2014 Expecting 411: Clear \nAnswers and Smart Advice for Your Pregnancy, Baby 411, and Toddler 411 (Windsor Peak Press).\nIn response to the recent media attention given to vaccines, autism, and other controversies concerning \nvaccines, the Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) has reprinted a special excerpt from Baby 411  that \nanswers these questions and more. IAC thanks Dr. Brown for this clearly written information, but mostly, \nwe are grateful for her continued advocacy for safe and effective vaccines .\nImmunization Action Coalition  \u2022  1573 Selby Ave.  \u2022  St. Paul, MN 55104  \u2022  (651) 647-9009  \u2022  www.immunize.org  \u2022  www.vaccineinformation.orgBy Ari Brown, MD, FAAP\nwww.immunize.org/catg.d/p2068.pdf  \u2022  Item #P2068 (9/13)\n\u2022\tEnvironmental triggers:  Is there some environmental exposure \nthat sets off abnormal brain development in a genetically \npredisposed baby? Maybe. And that exposure may happen at \nor shortly after conception, before a mother even knows she is \npregnant. The embryo has a critical period of brain development \nat 20\u201324 days after conception. That is when the developing brain \nis most sensitive to injury. Studies done by the Environmental \nWorking Group have detected over 280 environmental toxins in \numbilical cord blood, so clearly pregnant moms are exposed to a \nvariety of toxins. Could one of these be the autism trigger? We \ndon\u2019t know.\n Viral infections during pregnancy also may be a key environmental \ntrigger that causes abnormal genes in the fetus. Those infections \ninclude rubella, CMV (cytomegalovirus), and influenza (yes, \n\u201cthe flu\u201d).5 \n What about vaccines as an environmental trigger? Researchers \nand scientists have taken a long, hard look at vaccines\u2014and there \nis conclusive evidence that vaccine exposure is NOT the turn-on \nswitch for autism.6\nBottom line: There\u2019s evidence that newborns who are later \ndiagnosed with ASD already have abnormal levels of certain \nproteins in their brains. So, whatever the trigger is (if there is \none), it has been fired before the baby even enters the world.\n\u2022\tPrematurity:  A developing brain is quite vulnerable. Premature, \nvery low birth-weight babies (under three pounds) have a 25 \npercent chance of developing an autism spectrum disorder.7\n\u2022\tOlder parents:  Another possible reason for the increase of \nautism: the trend of parents having babies at a later age. Moms \nwho conceive after the age of 40 have a 30 percent increased risk \nof having a child with autism. Dads who conceive after the age of \n40 have a 50 percent increased risk of having an autistic child.8 \nScientists speculate that an older dad\u2019s sperm may have defective \ngenetic material, possibly altered by environmental toxins.\n\u2022\tClosely spaced pregnancies:  A 2011 study compared children \nwho were conceived at least three years after their sibling \nwas born to closer-spaced pregnancies and found that babies \nconceived less than 12 months after the birth of the first-born \nchild were THREE times more likely to be diagnosed with autism \nspectrum disorder. Babies conceived from 12 to 23 months after \nthe birth of the first-born child had almost two times the risk of \nASD. And, even babies conceived 23 to 35 months after the first-\nborn child had a slightly greater risk of ASD.\nUnfortunately, the researchers have no idea why the odds are \ngreater when the spacing between pregnancies is shorter. Perhaps \nit\u2019s because a woman\u2019s nutritional stores have not had enough \ntime to be replenished. Or maybe women who have put off \nparenthood until later in life have more closely spaced babies\u2014\nand parental age itself is a risk factor for having a child with an \nASD.\nThis study alone should not necessarily influence your decision \non how long to wait between pregnancies. However, the current \nrecommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention is to wait at least 18 to 23 months between pregnancies \nfor a mother\u2019s and baby\u2019s optimal health.9 And again, children with subtle atypical behaviors may be harder \nto diagnose early on. Reviewing home movies of a child once the \ndiagnosis is made often shows that early signs are overlooked.1\nQ: OK, so what causes autism?\nThe million-dollar question. \nIn the 1980s, one in 10,000 kids was diagnosed with autism. Today, \none in 150 American 8-year-olds has some form of autism. Boys \noutnumber girls four to one. The United States is not the only coun -\ntry seeing this trend. It is increasingly diagnosed worldwide.\nFor starters, is it really an epidemic? Or, are more people being diag -\nnosed? Many children who were diagnosed with mental retardation \n30 years ago are children who are diagnosed with classic autism \ntoday. And mildly disabled ASD kids today are children who never \nwould have had a diagnosis 30 years ago. Those verbal, but socially \nawkward, children account for the majority of new ASD cases.\nHere are the hottest areas of autism research today:\n\u2022\tGenetics:  There is no question genetics plays a role. Autism runs \nin families. I have a family in my practice and all four children \nhave a diagnosis on the autism spectrum. \nStudying twins is an obvious way to detect genetic disorders. If \none identical twin has autism, up to 90 percent of the time, so will \nthe other twin. To date, studies suggest there is more than just one \n\u201cautism gene\u201d; there appear to be several.\nASD children have several different abnormalities with their \nDNA. However the X chromosome is one of interest because of \nthe high prevalence of boys with ASDs.2\nFragile X Syndrome, which is a known genetic cause of autism, \nalso points to a defective X chromosome in ASD.\nAnd Rett Syndrome, which is a disorder causing developmental \nregression and autistic behaviors in girls, is caused by a defective \nMECP2 gene located on the X chromosome.3\nWe also know that kids with autism and defects on Chromosome \n11 have dysfunctional \u201cneurexin 1 protein.\u201d Researchers are \nlooking into how this defective protein affects fetal and infant \nbrain growth.\nFinding these specific genetic defects may help in genetic \ncounseling, as well as therapies, in the future. Animal studies \nalready are underway for targeted genetic therapy in both Fragile \nX and Rett Syndrome.\n\u2022\tAbnormal brain growth: ASD children have problems with \nbrain growth. Babies are born with immature brains that grow \nrapidly and make nerve connections called synapses ... like an \ninformation superhighway. In the normally growing brain, some \nbranches of this superhighway get \u201cpruned.\u201d In the autistic brain, \nthis pruning process seems to be defective. This may explain \nwhy babies who are autistic have abnormally rapid head growth \nunder 1 year of age. No one has yet figured out what causes \nthat defective nerve growth. Of note, boys with ASD have \nhigher levels of hormones (insulin-like growth factor) that may \ncontribute to their larger head size, weight, and body mass index.4Clear Answers & Smart Advice About Your Baby\u2019s Shots           page 2 of 6Bottom line:  Researchers don\u2019t know what causes autism, \nalthough the above factors provide clues. The goal is to find a \nway to prevent autism \u2026 but we aren\u2019t there yet.\nVaccines\nQ: Why do you care whether I vaccinate my child  \nor not?\nFor starters, we want your baby to be protected. \nBut we also want you to realize that the decision to vaccinate \nyour child impacts the health of other children in the community. \nChoosing NOT to vaccinate your child is choosing to put your child \nAND your community\u2019s children at risk. As a parent, you want \nto make the right choices to protect your child. I want you to ask \nquestions. I want you to be informed. And I want you to get your \nchild vaccinated. YOUR decision impacts ALL children. Why?\nThere are two critical points for vaccination to work: \n1. You need to be vaccinated.\n2. Your neighbor needs to be vaccinated.\nThis concept is called herd immunity. And yes, you are a member of \na herd. When 90 to 95 percent of \u201cthe herd\u201d is protected, it is nearly \nimpossible for a germ to cause an epidemic. Think of germs as rain. \nVaccination is a raincoat. Even with a raincoat on, you can still get \nwet. You need an umbrella, too. The umbrella is \u201cherd immunity.\u201d \nThose who don\u2019t vaccinate expect someone to share their umbrella \nwhen it rains. But society can only buy umbrellas TOGETHER. And \nraincoats aren\u2019t made for newborns\u2014they need umbrellas!\nSome parenting decisions have little or no impact on the community \nat large. Deciding whether or not your child eats organic baby food, \ngoes to preschool, or sleeps in a family bed is entirely up to you\u2014\nyour decision only affects your child. \nHowever, your decision whether or not to vaccinate your child \naffects all our kids. If you are a parent who is considering delaying \nor skipping vaccinations altogether, please realize the impact of \nyour decision.\nIf more than 10 percent of American parents choose to \u201copt out\u201d \nof vaccines, there\u2019s no question that our entire country will see \nthese horrible diseases of bygone days return. Fortunately, very \nfew parents decide to do this. What is most concerning today is that \nthere are pockets of under-vaccinated children. Birds of a feather \nflock together. Like-minded parents who don\u2019t vaccinate their kids \ntend to live in the same community and send their kids to the same \nschools. With lower immunization rates, there is no herd immunity. \nWe have these \u201cGround Zero\u201d areas to thank for recent measles and \nwhooping cough outbreaks of 2008 and 2011.10\nQ: I\u2019ve heard that the MMR vaccine might cause \nautism. Is this true?\nNo. Parents also hear that vaccinations cause multiple sclerosis, \ndiabetes, asthma, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). None \nof these are caused by vaccination. The government operates a safety \nmonitoring system (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, Food \nand Drug Administration, CDC) watching for any possible adverse \neffects from vaccines. No one wants to increase autism rates.One small case report of only eight patients in 1998 led a research \ngroup to feel that the combination measles, mumps, and rubella \n(MMR) vaccine might cause autism.11 But, don\u2019t try to find the \narticle online because the journal that published it later retracted it \nwhen a former member of the research lab revealed that the data \nreported in the study was fabricated!12 Twelve years later, the lead \nauthor lost his license to practice medicine in England and was \naccused of fraud. The whole thing was a hoax.\nBefore this came to light, several reputable scientists tried to \nduplicate the findings of this now discredited researcher. No one \never could\u2014and now we know why!\nUnfortunately, frightened parents chose to skip the MMR vaccine \nand measles epidemics occurred in the United Kingdom and the \nUnited States as a result of these unfounded claims.\nBottom line:  Don\u2019t base health decisions for your child on one \nresearch study or what the media says! Talk to your child\u2019s doctor \nabout any vaccine safety concerns.\nQ: If the MMR vaccine doesn\u2019t cause autism, why \nis the diagnosis made around the same time as the \nvaccination?\nOne of the criteria used to make a diagnosis of autism is a language \ndelay. Because children do not have significant expressive language \nunder a year of age, doctors have to wait until 15 to 18 months to \nconfirm a language delay and make the diagnosis. That\u2019s about the \nsame time as the MMR vaccination, which leads some parents to \nwonder about autism and vaccination.\nQ: I\u2019ve heard mercury preservative is in vaccines. Is  \nthis true?\nOnly a few remain. Preservatives and stabilizers are used in \nvaccines so the vaccinations remain potent and uncontaminated. A \npopular preservative used to be a chemical called thimerosal, which \ncontained trace amounts of ethylmercury. Thimerosal use began in \nthe 1940s.\nThimerosal was removed from all vaccines given to infants younger \nthan age 6 months by 2001. This deserves repeating: YOUR young \nbaby will not be getting vaccines that contain mercury (thimerosal) \nas a preservative. The one exception is the influenza vaccine that \nis found in multi-dose vials that need a preservative to prevent \ncontamination. Influenza vaccine that is packaged in single dose \nvials does not need a preservative and many clinics choose to use \nthese individual vials with the youngest patients. Remember, it\u2019s \nvery important that children get vaccinated against influenza each \nfall or winter beginning when they are 6 months old.\nDespite the fact that most vaccines are mercury preservative-free \nnow, speculation persists about vaccines previously containing \nmercury and links to autism. This speculation continues even after \nthe Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a conclusive report in \n2004 negating any association between vaccines and autism. (The \nIOM spent four years studying both the mercury question and the \nMMR combo vaccine question and published a series of eight \nreports on the subject.)\nA quick chemistry lesson: Certain compounds have completely \ndifferent properties even though they may be related. For instance, Clear Answers & Smart Advice About Your Baby\u2019s Shots          page 3 of 6the anticipated flu strains. Since millions of doses of flu vaccine are \nneeded every year, the most efficient way to produce the shot is in \nmulti-dose vials, which require a preservative. \nHence, some flu shots (not the flu nasal spray) contain the \npreservative thimerosal. However, there are single-dose preparations \nof flu vaccine that are mercury preservative-free. These can be \ngiven to young children and pregnant women. Ask your doctor for a \nthimerosal-free flu vaccine if you are concerned.\nEven though thimerosal is safe, it would be ideal for all flu vaccines \nto be thimerosal preservative-free\u2014this would put any concerns to \nrest. However, the technology just isn\u2019t there yet.\nThe Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University has a \nchart online that tracks any thimerosal content in vaccines: www.\nvaccinesafety.edu/thi-table.htm .\nFYI:  Many vaccines such as the combination measles, mumps, and \nrubella vaccine never used thimerosal in the production process or \nas a preservative.\nReality Check: Worried about the mercury preservative \n(thimerosal) in your child\u2019s flu vaccine? Consider this: A tuna \nfish sandwich has five times more mercury than a thimerosal-preserved flu vaccine.\n15 And the type of mercury (methylmercury) \nfound in tuna is the one that has health concerns. Also, a baby who is exclusively breastfed for six months of life consumes about 0.36 mg of methylmercury from breast milk. That\u2019s 15 times the quantity of ethylmercury in one flu vaccine!\nBottom line:  As a doc, I am much more concerned about your \nbaby\u2019s mercury exposure from the environment than what\u2019s in a flu \nshot. Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\nProduct Amount of Mercury Type of Mercury\nTuna, 5.6 oz can 0.115 mg Methyl\nBreast milk, 1 liter  0.015 mg Methyl\nFlu vaccine with thimerosal  0.025 mg  Ethyl\nQ: Does thimerosal cause autism?\nNo. The Institute of Medicine reached this conclusion in 2004. What \nproof do we have?\nThimerosal has been removed from most vaccines since 2001, but \nthe rates of autism are still skyrocketing. A 2008 survey of autism \nrates in California confirms that mercury is essentially out and \nautism rates are still going up. If thimerosal was the cause and it \nwas removed from vaccines seven years ago, autism rates would \nbe going down by now. Why? Because autism spectrum disorders \nare usually diagnosed by 3 years of age. By now, any reduction in \nautism should have been obvious if thimerosal caused the disorder.16\n\u2022\tMercury preservatives were removed from vaccines in Denmark \nin 1992. Canada and the European Union followed suit shortly \nthereafter. However, their autism rates are going up too.\n\u2022\tMad Hatter\u2019s Disease (mercury poisoning) and autism are very \ndifferent disorders (see chart in next column).\n\u2022\tA study of 100,000 kids in England compared those receiving \nthimerosal-containing vaccines to those who did not. The ones \nwho had the t-free shots had HIGHER rates of autism.17take the alcohol family. Methanol is anti-freeze; ethanol is a \nBud Light. Keep this in mind when we discuss mercury. We are \nall exposed to small amounts of mercury. The type of mercury \nthat has raised health concerns is called methylmercury. High \nconcentrations of methylmercury can be found in tuna, swordfish \nand shark from contaminated waters. The information known \nabout mercury poisoning comes from unfortunate communities \nthat have experienced it. Example: There is a large amount of data \nfrom the Faroe Islands, near Iceland. The people there would eat \nwhale blubber contaminated with toxic levels of methylmercury \nand polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Children, especially those \nexposed as fetuses during their mother\u2019s pregnancy, seemed to have \nlower scores on memory, attention, and language tests than their \nunexposed peers. (They were not diagnosed with autism or Attention \nDeficit Disorder, however.)13\nChronic exposure to liquid methylmercury causes Mad Hatter\u2019s \nDisease, named for hat makers who used liquid mercury in the \nhat-making process. The disease consists of psychiatric problems, \ninsomnia, poor memory, sweating, tremors, and red palms. Chronic \nmercury poisoning also impairs kidney function.\nMethylmercury is a small molecule that can get into the brain\u2014it \ntakes almost two months to break down in the body. Ethylmercury \n(the type of mercury that was previously used as a vaccine \npreservative) is a large molecule that cannot enter the brain and is \nrapidly eliminated from the body within a week.\nBecause of the increased number of vaccinations that children get, \nthe potential cumulative exposure to mercury became a concern in \n1999.\nThere are three federal groups that set standards for acceptable daily \nmercury exposure (the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], \nthe Food and Drug Administration [FDA], and the Agency for \nToxic Substances and Disease Registry). When the exposure was \ncalculated, the cumulative dose was higher than acceptable levels \nset by the EPA only (the other groups\u2019 standards were higher). As a \nresult of these findings, the Public Health Service (which includes \nthe FDA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a joint \nstatement as a precautionary measure, urging vaccine manufacturers \nto reduce or eliminate thimerosal in vaccines as soon as possible.14 \nThis was issued in 1999 before scientists had an opportunity to \nstudy the potential health effects of thimerosal-containing vaccines. \nNumerous studies have since shown that there is no relationship \nbetween vaccines, either with or without thimerosal, and the \ndevelopment of autism or other neurologic problems in children.\nQ: I heard that I should still ask my doctor if the \nvaccines for my baby are thimerosal-free. What do \nyou suggest?\nWe think you should ask as many questions as you need to feel \ncomfortable. Remember that since 2001, most childhood vaccines \ngiven to infants and children went thimerosal (mercury) preservative-\nfree. If your doctor has a 2001 vintage vaccine vial sitting on the \nshelf (which would be expired by now), he needs to re-stock. To \ngive you some perspective, my practice buys its vaccine supply on \na monthly basis.\nWhy does flu vaccine need thimerosal or any other preservative? \nFirst, understand the flu vaccine is reformulated every year to reflect Clear Answers & Smart Advice About Your Baby\u2019s Shots             page 4 of 6Why is aluminum used in vaccines? Aluminum enhances the \nimmune system\u2019s response to the vaccine. It\u2019s been used safely \nfor several decades. By using aluminum salts, some inactivated \nvaccines require fewer booster shots for the body to mount an \nadequate immune response.\nAre there any health concerns with aluminum in vaccines? No. \nThere is significantly less aluminum in vaccines than what babies are \nexposed to in the environment. Both the National Vaccine Program \nOffice and the World Health Organization have determined that the \naluminum content in the childhood vaccination series is safe.\nDoes aluminum poisoning cause autism? No. People with aluminum \npoisoning have bone problems (osteomalacia) and anemia, as well as \nneurologic issues. These include memory loss, fatigue, depression, \nbehavioral changes, and learning impairment. Aluminum also \nhas been proposed as the cause of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. To date, \nhowever, there is little evidence that aluminum causes that disorder.21\nHow much aluminum is in vaccines? Very little. If your baby \nfollows the standard immunization schedule, he is exposed to about \nfour to six milligrams (mg) of aluminum at six months of life. \nBy comparison, he\u2019s also exposed to 10 mg of aluminum if he is \nbreastfed, 40 mg if he is fed cow\u2019s milk-based formula, or 120 mg \nif he is fed soy formula. None of these are very large amounts, by \nthe way. To put things in perspective, there are about 200 mg of \naluminum in a standard antacid tablet. In fact, the average adult \ningests seven to nine milligrams of aluminum every day. Here\u2019s a \nlook at how much aluminum is in breast milk/formula, compared \nwith vaccines:\nAmount of aluminum exposure (milligrams per liter)22\nProduct     Amount of aluminum\nBreast milk    0.01\u20130.05 mg/L\nCow\u2019s milk-based infant formula  0.06\u20130.15 mg/L\nSoy-based infant formula   0.46\u20130.93 mg/L\nPrevnar vaccine    0.125 mg/dose\nDTaP vaccine    0.17\u20130.625 mg/dose\nHIB vaccine    0.225 mg/dose\nHep A vaccine    0.225\u20130.25 mg/dose\nHep B vaccine    0.25\u20130.5 mg/dose\nDTaP/IPV/HIB vaccine   1.5 mg/dose\nIs it a good idea to space out vaccinations that contain aluminum \nsalts? No. Since aluminum-containing vaccines do not cause any \nhealth risk, separating or spacing out these vaccines has no benefit. \nIn fact, there is a risk to spacing out the vaccines\u2014your baby will go \nunprotected against real vaccine-preventable disease.\u2022\tA 2007 study showed that children between 7 and 10 years of age \nwho got those mercury-containing vaccines (before 2001) have \nno significant differences in tests of attention and processing \ninformation. Although the study did not look specifically at \nautism, it showed that mercury preservatives did not make much \nof an impact on brain functions in general. A follow-up study that \nspecifically addresses autism is underway.18\nDid thimerosal cause autism? Notice the differences between autism \nand mercury poisoning:\n Autism Mercury Poisoning19\nMotor Repetitive movements Wobbly, shaky gait\nVision Normal Impaired\nSpeech Delay, repetitive sounds Articulation problem\nSensory Hyper-responsive Loss of sensation\nPsychiatric Aloof, likes sameness Psychosis, depression\nHead size Large Small\nQ: Are there other additives in the vaccines?\nYes. And you should know about them.\nVaccines contain the active ingredients that provide immunity. But \nthere are inactive ingredients that improve potency and prevent \ncontamination. Below is a list of additives and why they are there. \nThese products are present in trace amounts and none have been \nproven harmful in animals or humans.20\n\u2022\tPreservatives:  Prevent vaccine contamination with germs \n(bacteria, fungus). Examples: 2-phenoxyethanol, phenol, and \nthimerosal (prior to 2001).\n\u2022\tAdjuvants : Improve potency/immune response. Example: \naluminum salts.\n\u2022\tAdditives:  Prevent vaccine deterioration and sticking to the side \nof the vial. Examples: gelatin, albumin, sucrose, lactose, MSG, \nglycine.\n\u2022\tResiduals:  Remains of vaccine production process. Examples: \nformaldehyde, antibiotics (Neomycin), egg protein, yeast protein.\nSee our website (www.Baby411.com, click on \u201cBonus Material\u201d) \nfor a list of ingredients for the routine childhood vaccination series.\nQ: Why is aluminum in vaccines?\nNow that the mercury (thimerosal) saga is coming to an end, anti-\nvaccine crusaders have come up with a  new bad guy: aluminum. \nYes, trace amounts of aluminum salts are used in some childhood \nvaccines. Here\u2019s all you need to know (and more) about aluminum.\nBottom line: We are not worried about it.\nAluminum is everywhere. It\u2019s the most common metal in our earth\u2019s \ncrust. So it is naturally present in our water, soil, and even in the \nair. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, flour, cereal, dairy products, and yes, \neven baby formula and breast milk \u2026 all contain some aluminum. \nDo you wear antiperspirant? It\u2019s in there, too. To avoid aluminum \nexposure, you\u2019d have to quit wearing antiperspirant \u2026 and basically \nleave the planet. Clear Answers & Smart Advice About Your Baby\u2019s Shots             page 5 of 6\nReality Check: If vaccines contain ingredients like aluminum \nor formaldehyde, wouldn\u2019t it be better if vaccine makers got rid of \nthese additives? Shouldn\u2019t vaccines be \u201cgreener\u201d? \nThis is a red herring argument against vaccines\u2014current vac-\ncines are safe, even with tiny/trace amounts of preservatives or \nadditives like aluminum. And your baby is exposed to many of \nthese ingredients every day \u2026 simply by eating or breathing. Q: Why is formaldehyde in vaccines?\nSmall amounts of formaldehyde are used to sterilize the vaccine fluid \nso your child doesn\u2019t get something like flesh-eating Strep bacteria \nwhen he gets his shots. We know when you think of formaldehyde, \nyou think of that ever-present smell wafting from the anatomy lab in \nhigh school. But what you probably don\u2019t know is that formaldehyde \nis also a naturally occurring substance in your body. And if you use \nbaby shampoo, paper towels or mascara, or have carpeting in your \nhome, you\u2019ve been exposed to formaldehyde. The small amount \nused in vaccines is not a health concern.23\nQ: Is it true that anti-freeze is used in vaccines?\nNo. Antifreeze has never been a component of vaccines. Antifreeze \nproducts commonly contain either ethylene glycol or propylene \nglycol. A product with a similar name, polyethylene glycol (PEG), \nis used in the production process to purify vaccines. PEG is not \nantifreeze! PEG is also found in medications, toothpastes, laxatives, \nlubricant eye drops, and various skin care creams.\nQ: Is it safer to delay vaccines or use an alternative \nvaccination schedule?\nEasy answer: No. The CDC publishes a recommended vaccine \nschedule for American children. Many, many doctors, scientists, and \nresearchers work together with the CDC to decide what is the best \ntiming to give shots. The goal: Protect babies as soon as it is safe \nand effective to do so. This schedule was not created out of thin air.\nBetween anti-vaccine activists shouting \u201ctoo many shots, too soon\u201d \nand Dr. Bob Sears hawking his book, new parents wonder if it would \nsomehow be safer to wait on shots altogether or stagger them out on \n\u201cDr. Bob\u2019s schedule.\u201d \nHere\u2019s a nasty little truth about alternative vaccination schedules: \nThey are all fantasy. There is absolutely no research that says \ndelaying certain shots is safer. Dr. Bob is making up \u201cDr. Bob\u2019s \nSchedule\u201d all by himself. He even admits that. In an interview with \niVillage, he commented, \u201cMy schedule doesn\u2019t have any research \nbehind it. No one has ever studied a big group of kids using my \nschedule to determine if it\u2019s safe or if it has any benefits.\u201d\nA 2010 study actually did evaluate children whose vaccinations were \ndelayed and found absolutely no difference in their development \ncompared with children who had received their shots on time. I\u2019d \nmuch rather follow a schedule that has been extensively researched \nfor both safety and effectiveness by experts in the field of infectious \ndiseases.\nWhat we do know about alternative vaccination schedules is that \ndelaying shots is playing Russian roulette with your child. The \nsimple truth is that you are leaving your child unprotected, at a time \nwhen she is the most vulnerable.\nWe realize that parents who choose to delay or opt out on vaccines \nare not bad parents. They are scared parents. What we are trying to \nhelp you realize is that the fear you should have is for the diseases \nthat vaccines prevent. If you are on the fence about vaccinations, \nplease take the time to research the disease\u2014and talk to your child\u2019s \ndoctor.Q: If I want to do a staggered vaccination schedule, \nhow should I do it?\nI suggest setting up a consultation with your own pediatrician to \ndiscuss what both of you feel comfortable with doing. Remember, \nthe ultimate goal is to have your child vaccinated in a timely manner.\nQ: Didn\u2019t the government concede that vaccines \ncaused a child\u2019s autism?\nDuring the equivalent of a class action lawsuit against the \ngovernment (called the \u201cOmnibus Autism Proceedings\u201d), one child, \nHannah Poling, received a monetary settlement. The court did not \nhear her case. Hannah\u2019s case was being reviewed to serve as one \nof the test cases for a suit to represent 5,000 families who believe \nvaccines caused their child\u2019s autism.\nDuring the review process, it was determined that Poling did not \nrepresent a test case because she had a rare, underlying genetic \nmitochondrial disorder that caused her deterioration and autism. For \nrare kids like her, any stress could have caused her to deteriorate. \nThis is the equivalent of being born with an aneurysm, a ticking \ntime bomb that could go off at any moment. Although she was not \ndiagnosed prior to being vaccinated, experts recommend that even \nchildren with known mitochondrial disorders still be vaccinated.\nBottom line:  The government did NOT concede that vaccines \ncause autism in the Poling case.\nCitations\n1.

Most vaccinations \nare given as injections. \nWhat diseases do vaccines protect against?\nVaccines protect against diseases like \nmeasles, mumps, rubella, influenza,  \nhepatitis B, hepatitis A,  \npolio, tetanus,  \nwhooping cough,  \nchickenpox, rotavirus, \nand more. Vaccines \ncan\u2019t protect children \nfrom minor illnesses like colds, but they  \ncan keep children safe from many serious \ndiseases.\nIsn\u2019t all this talk about diseases just a  \nway to scare parents so they\u2019ll bring  \ntheir babies in for shots? \nNo. These diseases can injure and kill \nchildren in the United States. For example, \npertussis is a dangerous disease for infants. \nDuring 1997\u20132000, nearly 30,000 pertussis \ncases were reported; 62 resulted in death.  \nIn 2003 alone, 11,647 cases and 18 deaths \nfrom pertussis were reported. Influenza \nalso takes a toll on children. During the \n2003\u201304 influenza season, 40 states \nreported 152 influenza-related deaths  \namong children younger than 18 years \nof age. I don\u2019t know anybody who has had  \nmeasles or rubella. Why does my baby \nneed these shots?\nY ou might not think that measles and rubella \nare a threat today because you don\u2019t see \nor hear much about them, but they are still \naround. These diseases are common in other \nparts of the world and are just a plane ride \naway. If we stop vaccinating against these \ndiseases, many more people will become \ninfected. Vaccinating your child will keep him \nor her safe.\nIsn\u2019t there some way besides vaccination \nto protect my baby against these diseases?\nNo. Breastfeeding offers temporary immunity \nagainst some minor infections like colds, but it \nis not an effective means of protecting a child \nfrom the specific diseases preventable by  \nvaccines. Likewise, vitamins don\u2019t protect \nagainst the specific bacteria and viruses that \ncause these serious diseases.\nOf course, infection usually results in \nimmunity, and some parents think that \ngetting the \u201cnatural\u201d disease is preferable to \n\u201cartificial\u201d vaccination. Some even arrange \nchickenpox \u201cparties\u201d to ensure their child is \ninfected. However, the price paid for natural \ndisease can include paralysis, retardation, liver \ncancer, deafness, blindness, or even death. \nVaccination is definitely a better choice!\nAre vaccinations safe?\nVaccines are safe, and scientists continually \nwork to make sure they become even safer. \nEvery vaccine undergoes many tests before being licensed, and its safety continues to be \nmonitored as long as the vaccine is in use.\nMost side effects from vaccination are minor, \nsuch as soreness where the injection was  \ngiven or a low-grade fever. These side \neffects do not last long and are treatable.  \nSerious reactions are very rare. The tiny \nrisk of a serious vaccine reaction has to be \nweighed against the very real risk of getting \na dangerous vaccine-preventable disease.  \nIf you have concerns or questions, talk to  \nyour child\u2019s healthcare provider.                      \nWhat if my baby has a cold or fever,  \nor is taking antibiotics? Can he or  \nshe still get vaccinated?\nY es. Y our child can still be vaccinated if he or \nshe has a mild illness, a low-grade fever, or is \ntaking antibiotics. Ask your child\u2019s healthcare \nprovider if you have questions.\nHow many times do I need to bring my \nbaby in for vaccinations?\nAt least five visits are needed before age two, \nbut the visits can be timed to coincide with \nwell-child check-ups. Y our baby should get the \nfirst vaccine (hepatitis B) shortly after  \nbirth, while still in the hospital. Multiple visits \nduring the first two years are necessary  \nbecause there are 14 diseases your baby can \nbe protected against, and most require several \ndoses of vaccine for the best protection.\nHow do I know when to take my baby  \nin for shots?\nY our healthcare provider should give you a \nreminder when the next doses are due.

Si usted no \nest\u00e1 seguro llame a la cl\u00ednica o al consultorio \nde su profesional de la salud para averiguar \ncu\u00e1ndo debe llevar de vuelta a su hijo. Las dosis \nno se deben dar demasiado cerca la una de \nla otra porque no da tiempo a que se forme \nla inmunidad. Por otro lado, tampoco hay \nque demorar ni atrasarse porque durante ese \ntiempo su hijo no est\u00e1 protegido contra estas \nenfermedades.\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa si falto a una cita? \u00bfTiene que \nempezar mi beb\u00e9 todas las vacunas de \nnuevo?\nNo. Si pasa por alto algunas dosis no es \nnecesario empezar de nuevo.

La mayor\u00eda de \nlas vacunas se dan como inyecciones.\n\u00bfContra cu\u00e1les enfermedades protegen las \nvacunas?\nLas vacunas protegen contra \nenfermedades como sarampi\u00f3n, \npaperas, rub\u00e9ola, gripe (o \ninfluenza), hepatitis B, \nhepatitis A, poliomielitis, \nt\u00e9tanos, tos ferina, \nvaricela, rotavirus y \nm\u00e1s. Las vacunas no \npueden proteger a los ni\u00f1os contra \nenfermedades menores, como resfriados, \npero s\u00ed pueden evitar que tengan muchas \nenfermedades serias.\n\u00bfAcaso no se dicen todas estas cosas sobre \nlas enfermedades s\u00f3lo para asustar a los \npadres y hacer que vacunen a sus beb\u00e9s?\nNo. Estas enfermedades s\u00ed pueden hacer da\u00f1o \ny causar la muerte de ni\u00f1os en Estados Unidos. \nPor ejemplo, la tos ferina es una enfermedad \npeligrosa para los beb\u00e9s. Entre 1997 y 2000 \nse informaron cerca de 30,000 casos de tos \nferina y 62 de ellos resultaron en muertes. En \ns\u00f3lo el 2003 se informaron 11,647 casos y 18 \nmuertes de tos ferina. La gripe tambi\u00e9n afecta \ngravemente a los ni\u00f1os. Durante la temporada \nde gripe de 2003 a 2004, 40 estados informaron \n152 muertes relacionadas a la gripe de ni\u00f1os y \nadolescentes menores de 18 a\u00f1os de edad.No conozco a nadie que haya tenido \nsarampi\u00f3n o rub\u00e9ola. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 necesita \nmi beb\u00e9 estas vacunas? \nT al vez crea que el sarampi\u00f3n y la rub\u00e9ola no \nson una amenaza hoy en d\u00eda porque no ve ni \noye mucho acerca de ellas, pero todav\u00eda existen. \nEstas enfermedades son comunes en otras partes \ndel mundo y est\u00e1n a s\u00f3lo un viaje en avi\u00f3n de \ndistancia. Si dejamos de vacunar contra estas \nenfermedades muchas m\u00e1s personas ser\u00e1n \ninfectadas. Vacunar a su hijo lo mantendr\u00e1 seguro.\n\u00bfNo hay alguna otra manera de proteger \na mi beb\u00e9 contra estas enfermedades, \naparte de las vacunas?\nNo. Dar pecho ofrece inmunidad temporal \ncontra algunas infecciones menores, como \nresfriados, pero no es un medio eficaz para \nproteger a los ni\u00f1os contra las enfermedades \nespec\u00edficas que se pueden prevenir con las \nvacunas. Asimismo, las vitaminas no protegen \ncontra las bacterias y los virus espec\u00edficos que \ncausan estas enfermedades serias.\nPor supuesto, despu\u00e9s de tener la enfermedad \nuno, por lo general, tiene inmunidad contra ella. \nAlgunos padres piensan que tener la enfermedad \n\u201cnatural\u201d es mejor que una vacuna \u201cartificial\u201d. \nAlgunos hasta hacen \u201cfiestas\u201d de varicela para que \nsus hijos se la contagien. Sin embargo, el precio \nque se paga por la enfermedad natural puede \nincluir par\u00e1lisis, retraso mental, c\u00e1ncer del h\u00edgado, \nsordera, ceguera y hasta la muerte. \u00a1No cabe \nduda de que la vacuna es una mejor opci\u00f3n!\n\u00bfSon seguras las vacunas?\nLas vacunas son seguras y los cient\u00edficos se \nesfuerzan constantemente en que sean todav\u00eda \nm\u00e1s seguras. T odas las vacunas pasan por \nmuchas pruebas antes de ser autorizadas y su \nseguridad se sigue controlando todo el tiempo \nen que la vacuna est\u00e1 en uso. La mayor\u00eda de los efectos secundarios de las \nvacunas son menores, como dolor en el lugar \ndonde se aplic\u00f3 la vacuna o un poco de fiebre. \nEstos efectos secundarios no duran mucho \ntiempo y se pueden tratar. Las reacciones serias \nocurren muy rara vez. El peque\u00f1\u00edsimo riesgo \nde que haya una reacci\u00f3n seria a una vacuna se \ntiene que comparar con el riesgo muy real de \ncontagiarse una enfermedad peligrosa que se \npuede prevenir con una vacuna. Hable con el \nprofesional de la salud de su hijo si tiene alguna \npregunta o inquietud.\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa si mi beb\u00e9 est\u00e1 resfriado o \ntiene fiebre, o est\u00e1 tomando antibi\u00f3ticos?  \n\u00bfDe todas maneras lo pueden vacunar?\nS\u00ed. Si su hijo tiene una enfermedad leve, un \npoco de fiebre o est\u00e1 tomando antibi\u00f3ticos de \ntodas maneras lo pueden vacunar. Hable con el \nprofesional de la salud de su hijo si tiene alguna \npregunta.\n\u00bfCu\u00e1ntas veces tengo que llevar a mi beb\u00e9 \npara que lo vacunen?\nSe requieren al menos cinco visitas antes de los \ndos a\u00f1os de edad, pero las visitas se pueden \nhacer coincidir con los ex\u00e1menes del beb\u00e9 \nsano. Se debe aplicar la primera vacuna a su \nbeb\u00e9 (la de la hepatitis B) al poco tiempo de \nnacer, mientras que todav\u00eda est\u00e1 en el hospital. \nDurante los primeros dos a\u00f1os hay que llevarlo \nvarias veces para vacunarlo porque hay 14 \nenfermedades contra las que se puede proteger \na su beb\u00e9 y la mayor\u00eda de ellas requieren varias \ndosis de la vacuna para tener mejor protecci\u00f3n.\n?you  \ndon\u2019t  \nimmunize  \nyour  \nchildWe strongly encourage you to immunize your \nchild.

Tragically, every \nyear in the United States children die from \ninfluenza.\n\u2022\tPertussis or \u201cwhooping cough\u201d is an extremely \ndangerous disease for infants. It is not easily \ntreated and can result in permanent brain \ndamage or death. Since the 1980s, the number \nof cases of pertussis has increased, especially \namong babies younger than 6 months and \nteenagers. In 2010, several states reported an \nincrease in cases and outbreaks of pertussis, \nincluding a state-wide epidemic in California. \nMany infants died from whooping cough \nduring this epidemic .\n\u2022\tMeasles is dangerous and very contagious. It \nis still common in many countries and is easily \nbrought into the United States by returning \nvacationers and foreign visitors. The number \nof reported measles cases began to decline \nrapidly during the 1990s. Recently, vaccine \nhesitancy among parents in the United States \nand abroad has led to a growing number of \nchildren and teens who are under-vaccinated \nand thus, unprotected from measles. Unfor-tunately, measles cases are on the rise across \nthis country and worldwide.\n\u2022\tChickenpox is very contagious. Before the \ndevelopment of a vaccine, about 100 people \ndied every year in the United States from \nchickenpox. Most were previously healthy. \nChildren with chickenpox need to be kept out \nof day care or school for a week or more so \nthey don\u2019t spread the disease to others. \nChildren who are not immunized can readily \ntransmit vaccine-preventable diseases throughout \nthe community.\n\u2022\tUnvaccinated children can pass diseases \non to babies who are too young to be fully \nimmunized.\n\u2022\tUnvaccinated children pose a threat to children \nand adults who can\u2019t be immunized for \nmedical reasons. This includes people with \nleukemia and other cancers, immune system \nproblems, and people receiving treatment \nor medications that suppress their immune \nsystem.\n\u2022\tUnvaccinated children can infect the small  \npercentage of children who do not mount an \nimmune response to vaccination.\nDuring disease outbreaks, unimmunized children \nmay be excluded from school or child care \nuntil the outbreak is over. This is for their own \nprotection and the protection of others. It can \ncause hardship for the child and parent.   Without immunizations your  \n  child can infect others.      .\nWithout immunizations your  \n   child may have to be excluded  \n   from school or child care.      .\n      .VACCINE ADMINISTRATION\nRECORD & HISTORYPRACTICE NAME/ADDRESS\nPATIENT NAME (Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial)\nBIRTHDATE (mm/dd/yy) MALE\nFEMALECHART NUMBER KNOWN REACTIONS TO VACCINES/ALLERGIES\n\u2020 \u2020\n(e.g., DTaP, DT,\nDTaP-HepB-IPV,\nTd, Tdap, DTaP-\nIPV-HIB, DTaP-\nIPV)(e.g., Hib,\nHib-HepB,\nDTaP-IPV-HIB)\n(Hep B, DTaP-\nHepB-IPV )\n(e.g., IPV, DTaP-\nHepB-IPV,\nDTaP-IPV-HIB,\nDTaP-IPV)(e.g., VAR,\nMMRV)\nCheck here if patient had chickenpox and does not need vaccine.\n(e.g.,MMR, MMRV)\n( (Hep A)\nGive TIV = IM\nGive LAIV = IN\n* is the date you gave the patient the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) and you administered the vaccine.\n** : LD=Left Deltoid; LT=Left Thigh; RD=Right Deltoid; RT=Right Thigh.
