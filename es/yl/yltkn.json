Homeopathy is deemed a complementary or alternative therapy\nbecause its efficacy has not been scientifically proven [Gibson,\n[\n2018\n](#X0-Gibson2018)\n; Vithoulkas,\n[\n2017\n](#X0-Vithoulkas2017)\n; Fisher,\n[\n2017\n](#X0-Fisher2017)\n; Ministerio de Sanidad, Pol\u00edtica Social e Igualdad,\n[\n2011\n](#X0-MinisteriodeSanidadPoliticaSocialeIgualdad2011urldate)\n],\nand when it has been proved, its effectiveness is no greater than the placebo\neffect [Cucherat et al.,\n[\n2000\n](#X0-CucheratHaughGoochetal2000)\n; Howe, Goyer and Crum,\n[\n2017\n](#X0-HoweGoyerCrum2017)\n; Mathie et al.,\n[\n2017\n](#X0-MathieRamparsadLeggetal2017)\n;\nLoeb et al.,\n[\n2018\n](#X0-LoebRussellNeupaneetal2018)\n; Zion and Crum,\n[\n2018\n](#X0-ZionCrum2018)\n]. Hence, homeopathy is considered to\nbe a practice based on theoretical principles which are not backed by science,\nwhich is why it is also called a \u201cpseudoscience\u201d or \u201cfacsimile science\u201d [Oreskes,\n[\n2017\n](#X0-Oreskes2017)\n].\nIn Spain, this treatment is legal if prescribed by a health professional, although, as with\nother alternative therapies, there is no specific regulation on the required training of\ntherapists. The regulated sale of homeopathic products is a special case; this has always\nbeen restricted to pharmacies, where homeopathy has gradually carved out a niche for\nitself [Pray,\n[\n2006\n](#X0-Pray2006)\n]. In Spain, homeopathic products are not sold in supermarkets or\nhypermarkets, as opposed to food supplements based on vitamins, minerals or herbal\nmixtures, which are. For many years, homeopathic products were marketed in\npharmacies as medicines. At the end of 2017, however, the Spanish Agency of\nMedicines and Medical Devices turned down the license applications of the latest\nhomeopathic products registered as such in Spain. Nevertheless, their sale was not\nrestricted. At the time, there was no national legislation allowing homeopathic\nproducts to be registered as medicines. Although the skeptics celebrated the\nmeasure as a victory, it was to be short-lived; in April 2018, the Spanish government\nfinally regulated homeopathic products as medicines. The explanation it gave was\nthe need to harmonize national legislation with the European Directive in this\nregard.\n[\n1\n](#fn1x0)\n[\n2018\n](#X0-Salas2018urldate)\n].\nSpanish politicians have come out against these unconventional therapies. Indeed, a\nSpanish Euro-parliamentarian requested the European Commission (hereafter, EC) to\nrevise the directive and to stop calling homeopathy \u201cmedicine\u201d [Cabez\u00f3n,\n[\n2018\n](#X0-Cabezon2018urldate)\n]. The\nEC\u2019s response was as follows:\nEU legislation on homeopathic medicines was introduced in 1992 with the\naim of ensuring their quality and safety whilst at the same time providing a\nclear indication of their homeopathic nature. At the time of adoption of the\nlegislation, it was considered that despite the differences in recognition between\nMember States, consumers across the EU should be adequately protected if they\nchoose to use homeopathic medicines [Andriukaitis,\n[\n2018\n](#X0-Andriukaitis2018urldate)\n].\nThus, whereas the EC\u2019s standpoint is to offer guarantees for the safety of homeopathic\nproducts, in Spain there is a latent debate on the regulation of homeopathy that, whenever\nthe issue is aired by politicians, leads to social debate and breaking news. It is\ninteresting to note that, since 2017, thanks to a nonbinding legislative proposal on\npseudoscience, the country\u2019s four main political parties have shared the same\nstance: there is no scientific evidence to support complementary and alternative\nmedicine (CAM) and, therefore, it cannot receive public funding or be included in\nthe public health system. They have even come out against pseudoscience and\nin support of the need to monitor these practices. Therefore, in Spain there is,\npolitically speaking, no artificial controversy [Ceccarelli,\n[\n2011\n](#X0-Ceccarelli2011)\n; Ceccarelli,\n[\n2013\n](#X0-Ceccarelli2013)\n]. In\nother words, politicians have admitted that the effectiveness of homeopathy is\nnot a \u201cscientific\u201d debate because there is a clear consensus within the scientific\ncommunity on the absence of reliable evidence supporting the effectiveness of\nhomeopathic remedies; however, this is a relevant political issue that concerns\ngovernance.\nAlthough the use of homeopathy in Spain is limited compared with other\nalternative therapies \u2014 only 5% of the population are homeopathy users [Cano-Or\u00f3n,\nMendoza-Poudereux and Moreno-Castro,\n[\n2018, in press\n](#X0-Cano-OronMendoza-PoudereuxMoreno-Castro2018)\n; Centro de Investigaciones\nSociol\u00f3gicas,\n[\n2018\n](#X0-CIS2018)\n] \u2014 the skeptical movement\u2019s campaign against homeopathy has\ngained momentum in recent years [Cano-Or\u00f3n,\n[\n2018, submitted for publication\n](#X0-Cano-Oron2018)\n]. This\ntype of activism, which is also present in countries such as the U.K. and Australia\n[Caldwell,\n[\n2017\n](#X0-Caldwell2017)\n; Brosnan,\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Brosnan2015)\n; Flatt,\n[\n2013\n](#X0-Flatt2013)\n; Chatfield, Partington and Duckworth,\n[\n2012\n](#X0-ChatfieldPartingtonDuckworth2012)\n], has been promoted by civil society itself to discredit these therapies. The\nskeptical movement\u2019s discourse and activism have had social (the closure of\nvarious postgraduate courses taught at Spanish universities, as well as lobbying\npublic institutions to ban lectures on pseudotherapies in their facilities), political\n(political parties unanimously agreeing to reject pseudotherapies), media (social\nmedia users bringing pressure to bear on journalists to get them to support the\nscientific perspective) and economic consequences (the fall in sales of homeopathic\nproducts).\nRegarding the use of homeopathy in Spain, several facts are particularly striking in\nterms of the user profiles and information channels used to access information\nabout treatments [Cano-Or\u00f3n, Mendoza-Poudereux and Moreno-Castro,\n[\n2018, in\npress\n](#X0-Cano-OronMendoza-PoudereuxMoreno-Castro2018)\n]. Friends and acquaintances, who may also be described as the patient\u2019s \u201clay\nreferral network\u201d [Evans et al.,\n[\n2007\n](#X0-EvansShawThompsonetal2007)\n], were the most consulted source, followed\nby the Internet (28.2%). Nevertheless, this second information source can be\ninaccurate [Cole, Watkins and Kleine,\n[\n2016\n](#X0-ColeWatkinsKleine2016)\n], the choice of reliable sources depending\nentirely on the user\u2019s level of scientific and digital literacy [Armstrong-Heimsoth\net al.,\n[\n2017\n](#X0-Armstrong-HeimsothJohnsonMcCulleyetal2017)\n]. Analyzing this source in an isolated manner could, therefore, lead\nto misinterpretations. In all likelihood, the personal experiences of family and\nfriends have a greater influence on homeopathy users, who may then perform\nan active search on the Internet to find specific information on the treatment in\nquestion.\nAccording to the latest Spanish Foundation of Science and Technology report\n[Fundaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola para la Ciencia y la Tecnolog\u00eda,\n[\n2017\n](#X0-FECYT2017urldate)\n], 57.8% of Spaniards obtain\ninformation about science and technology on the Internet, specifically social networks\n(43%) and general digital media (34%). Due to the general disregard for homeopathy in\nSpain, and taking into account that homeopathy consumers have found in the Internet an\nimportant information source, this study has the following objectives: (a) to quantify\nheadlines of homeopathy-related stories published during the three-year study\nperiod; (b) to classify the story coverage tone (equidistant, skeptical or neutral) of\nthe phenomenon; and (c) to identify the predominant news genre used in its\ncoverage.\nThe study of the coverage of homeopathy by means of analyzing the headlines of digital dailies during a three-year period will allow us to obtain some indicators on their stance on the issue. Outcomes could help in identifying if these stances could be an obvious influence on public and political debates, i.e., whether there is any synchronicity in the analyzed period among the informative tone of digital dailies, the campaigns of the social movements\u2019 anti-homeopathy and the political decisions taken by the government.\n2\n[\n]\nHealth journalism and pseudoscience\nScience journalism, especially the kind specializing in health-related topics, has a great\nresponsibility toward citizens, because \u201cit does not merely transmit information, but\nparticipates in establishing the frames and narratives through which knowledge about\nhealth medicine is understood and circulated\u201d [Hallin and Briggs,\n[\n2015\n](#X0-HallinBriggs2015)\n, p. 95]. When\ndealing with news stories about pseudoscientific therapies, such as homeopathy, reiki and\nacupuncture, it is essential to identify how information is presented [Nissen et al.,\n[\n2013\n](#X0-NissenJohannessenSchunder-Tatzberetal2013urldate)\n].\nIn a meta-analysis of the media coverage of CAM, Weeks and Strudsholm\n[\n[\n2008\n](#X0-WeeksStrudsholm2008)\n] found that, by and large, its tone was clearly positive depending on the\ncountry. More recent studies of the media treatment of CAM in other countries\nobtained similar results [Lavorgna and Di Ronco,\n[\n2017\n](#X0-LavorgnaDiRonco2017)\n; Dong and Chan,\n[\n2016\n](#X0-DongChan2016)\n;\nLauricella,\n[\n2016\n](#X0-Lauricella2016)\n; Yel,\n[\n2014\n](#X0-Yel2014)\n; Dunne and Phillips,\n[\n2010\n](#X0-DunnePhillips2010)\n], although skeptical discourse is\napparently gaining ground [Rowlands,\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Rowlands2015urldate)\n; Flatt,\n[\n2013\n](#X0-Flatt2013)\n; Lewis, Orrock and Myers,\n[\n2010\n](#X0-LewisOrrockMyers2010)\n].\n2.1\n[\n]\nMedia coverage of homeopathy\nIn the specific case of homeopathy, Steuter [\n[\n2001\n](#X0-Steuter2001)\n] discovered that the coverage of homeopathy\nin newspapers and magazines in the U.S.A., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and the U.K.\nwas mostly neutral and without \u201cbias and distortion\u201d [Steuter,\n[\n2001\n](#X0-Steuter2001)\n, p. 4]. In light of this finding,\nit was understood that their point of view or tone was favorable with respect to the effectiveness\nof homeopathy. Only 15% of the news stories analyzed in this study presented homeopathy as\n\u201cjunk science.\u201d In contrast, more recent studies reveal a more critical media coverage of the topic:\n-\nAccording to a study conducted by Steuter [\n[2010](#X0-Steuter2010)], the homeopathy-related news stories published in English-language dailies in Canada, the U.S.A., the U.K., Australia, New Zealand and India, over a 10-year period (1998\u20132008), were mainly neutral (39%) and positive (38%), while more skeptical coverage, characterized by a negative point of view or tone (15%) or \u201coppositional balance\u201d (8%), was not as commonplace. On the whole, the study confirmed that the media coverage of homeopathy was similar in all these countries, with the only exceptions being the U.K., for exceeding the positive mean threshold, and the U.S.A., where a greater number of skeptical stories were published.\n-\nIn the U.K., two studies quantitatively analyzed the state of the question.\nThe first, conducted by Escrib\u00e0-Sales, Corti\u00f1as-Rovira and Alonso-Marcos\n[\n[2015](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015)], compared the situation in the U.K. with that in Spain by analyzing The Guardian , The Times and The Daily Telegraph from 2009 to 2014, during which it was claimed that the homeopathy-related coverage of these U.K. media outlets was mostly negative (71.1%, versus 17.1% in favor and 11.8% ambivalent). The second study, carried out by Caldwell [ [2017](#X0-Caldwell2017)], established 2007 as a critical juncture. Specifically, it pointed to the article that David Colquhoun \u2014 a university professor and leader of the skeptical campaign against homeopathy in the U.K. \u2014 published in Nature against the master\u2019s degree in Homeopathy as a turning point in the media coverage of homeopathy. Articles about university courses in homeopathy had been hitherto neutral or positive, but as of 2007 most coverage was negative.\n-\nIn Spain, Escrib\u00e0-Sales, Corti\u00f1as-Rovira and Alonso-Marcos [\n[2015](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015)] analyzed five dailies ( El Pa\u00eds , El Mundo , ABC , La Vanguardia and El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya ) between 2009 and 2014, concluding that, in general, the effectiveness of homeopathy was clearly challenged in 50% of the cases (25.7% in favor and 24.3% ambivalent). The authors highlighted the coverage of El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya and La Vanguardia , stating that while the former tended to adopt a position in favor of this therapy, the latter was ambivalent in most cases. In terms of the most prevalent genre, news stories were the most numerous, although El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya was again singled out for having published more opinion pieces than news stories.\nWe could be forgiven for thinking that the type of approach employed by these dailies is linked\nto the conclusions of scientific studies published in peer-reviewed journals. However, the\ndata suggest otherwise. Caulfield and DeBow [\n[\n2005\n](#X0-CaulfieldDeBow2005)\n] analyzed the results and the tone of\nhomeopathy-related papers in PubMed, detecting that the majority employed neutral or positive\nlanguage when discussing the results, which were mostly negative in conventional journals and\npositive in their counterparts specializing in CAM; this was attributed to publication-related bias.\nTherefore, in addition to the literature produced by academia, when writing news\nstories, journalists play a central role in constructing frames [Hallin and Briggs,\n[\n2015\n](#X0-HallinBriggs2015)\n;\nStocking and Holstein,\n[\n2009\n](#X0-StockingHolstein2009)\n] and \u201ccan contribute to the public\u2019s mental picture of health,\nincluding issues related to controversial CAM such as homeopathy\u201d [Arendt,\n[\n2016\n](#X0-Arendt2016)\n, p. 18].\nIn Germany, journalists\u2019 attitudes toward homeopathy have become polarized\nbetween two extremes: positive and negative. Those showing more favorable\nattitudes toward homeopathy are \u201cwomen journalists, journalists working in senior\npositions and journalists working on health-related content\u201d [Arendt,\n[\n2016\n](#X0-Arendt2016)\n, p. 20]. In\nSpain, a study was also performed on this issue, in this case focusing on science\njournalists. Here, polarization comprised two factions: one that felt that news about\npseudoscience should have no place in the press, and the other holding that it\nshould be covered, but only to inform and warn society [Corti\u00f1as-Rovira et al.,\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Cortinas-RoviraAlonso-MarcosPont-Sorribesetal2015)\n].\n2.2\n[\n]\nMedia effects of digital news\nFrom a communication theory perspective, recent studies indicate that in the current\ndigital media ecosystem media impact is minimal [Bennett and Iyengar,\n[\n2008\n](#X0-BennettIyengar2008)\n; Bennett and\nIyengar,\n[\n2010\n](#X0-BennettIyengar2010)\n; Shehata and Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck,\n[\n2013\n](#X0-ShehataStromback2013)\n], compared to that of agenda-setting or\nframing [Lazarsfeld, Berelson and Gaudet,\n[\n1944\n](#X0-LazarsfeldBerelsonGaudet1944)\n; Scheufele,\n[\n2000\n](#X0-Scheufele2000)\n; Scheufele and\nTewksbury,\n[\n2006\n](#X0-ScheufeleTewksbury2006)\n], since persuasion and the transmission of certain frames have the sole\neffect of strengthening what audiences are already willing to perceive [Sunstein,\n[\n2002\n](#X0-Sunstein2002)\n;\nPariser,\n[\n2011\n](#X0-Pariser2011)\n], namely, the so-called \u201cselective exposure\u201d or \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\n[D\u2019Angelo,\n[\n2018\n](#X0-DAngelo2018)\n].\nHowever, the testing of these theories in the science communication field has yielded\ndifferent results, demonstrating that \u201conline users interact differently with science\ninformation than with political information\u201d [Jang,\n[\n2014\n](#X0-Jang2014)\n, p. 161]. For example, Brewer\n[\n[\n2013\n](#X0-Brewer2013)\n] addressed the construction of scientific authority, claiming that specific media\nmessages can influence citizens\u2019 beliefs, in this case about paranormal investigations. Jang\n[\n[\n2014\n](#X0-Jang2014)\n], when analyzing the phenomenon of \u201cselective exposure\u201d to controversial scientific\nissues in the digital realm, discovered that, in these cases, the respondents did not follow\nthe \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d pattern, but paid more attention to news that diverged from their\nexisting knowledge.\nSimilarly, Chang [\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Chang2015)\n] underscored the respondents\u2019 greater level of skepticism,\nbecause information that contradicted or clashed with their existing knowledge was\nviewed with suspicion and led to confusion. Knobloch-Westerwick et al. [\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Knobloch-WesterwickJohnsonSilveretal2015)\n], after\nanalyzing how exposure to online science information affects citizens\u2019 attitudes, obtained\nresults that differed slightly from previous findings. The authors did indeed demonstrate\nthe respondents\u2019 \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d in regards to several scientific issues, although they\nqualified such evidence; unlike theories that suggest that citizens isolate themselves from\ndivergent opinions by entering echo chambers [Sunstein,\n[\n2002\n](#X0-Sunstein2002)\n] or filter bubbles [Pariser,\n[\n2011\n](#X0-Pariser2011)\n], the respondents consumed information that contradicted their beliefs, albeit in a\nvery modest fashion.\nAs for the media impact on the public perception of CAM, Caldwell [\n[\n2017\n](#X0-Caldwell2017)\n] reveals\nhow, since the launching of the skeptical media campaign against homeopathy, the media\nhave tended to criticize its teaching at U.K. universities. For its part, the U.K. government\nhas gone from supporting this alternative therapy to demanding evidence of its\neffectiveness. This specific case would confirm the influence, although not at a\npersonal/citizen level (the taking or not of homeopathic pills), but at an institutional and\nsocial one.\n3\n[\n]\nObjectives and hypothesis\nThe objectives of this study are the following. On the one hand, to quantify how often homeopathy is present in digital dailies and to check if the peaks in publication frequency concur with related political events, and on the other hand, to identify the dominant slant or tone of the headlines of homeopathy-related stories and observe their evolution during the analyzed period (qualitative study).\nThese objectives will be carried out via the main hypotheses of our study: the pattern and flow of publication peaks in the digital dailies analyzed could be connected to establishment politics and skeptical movement agenda issues.\nWhat is understood here as a political issue is a public debate or a political statement regarding the regulation or governance of the health system, or policies implemented in this respect, whereas social development refers to activities relating to activism, education, consumption, reports, surveys, etc.\n4\n[\n]\nMethods\nThe corpus comprises all the headlines of news items containing the word \u201chomeopathy,\u201d published in the 391 nationwide digital media outlets figuring in the MyNews database, during a three-year period (2015\u20132017). Although 2,545 news items were collected, after manual cleaning to remove those that either did not actually contain the term \u201chomeopathy\u201d or, when they did, homeopathy was neither the main nor a peripheral issue, this number was reduced to 1,673 news stories distributed as follows: 320 items in 2015; 532 items in 2016; and 825 items in 2017.\nThe headlines were then analyzed following Westall [\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Westall2015)\n] because, according to\nLozano Ascencio, Pi\u00f1uel Raigada and Gait\u00e1n Moya [\n[\n2010\n](#X0-LozanoAscencioPinuelRaigadaGaitanMoya2010)\n], they are the most critical\ninformation link between media outlets and their audiences. Moreover, a headline tends to\nsummarize the body copy and offers journalists the chance to indicate from which\nperspective the story has been narrated. Taking into account the current digital ecosystem,\nin which people have access to a great deal of information but no time to read it all, they\nare now more likely to read headlines than body copy, if they read those at all.\nAccording to Lozano Ascencio, Pi\u00f1uel Raigada and Gait\u00e1n Moya [\n[\n2010\n](#X0-LozanoAscencioPinuelRaigadaGaitanMoya2010)\n], visual\nzapping on dailies, which includes reading most of the headlines, is now the most\nprevalent reading method. For many, reading headlines is a good way of keeping\nabreast of the news and being well-informed. Thus, their analysis reveals the\ndiscursive sphere that is most accessible to audiences and whose narrative is the most\ninfluential.\nIn this study, the headline of each story was analyzed, including the platform on which it had been posted, the date of publication, the headline\u2019s slant or tone (favorable, equidistant, skeptical or neutral), and the news genre (information, opinion, interview or others). To identify the tendency of the homeopathy-related news stories contained in the corpus, a manual analysis was performed on their headlines\u2019 tone, which was classified as follows:\nThese four categories have been adapted from those used by Escrib\u00e0-Sales,\nCorti\u00f1as-Rovira and Alonso-Marcos [\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015)\n], albeit renaming their \u201cambivalent\u201d category\n\u201cequidistant\u201d and adding the \u201cneutral\u201d category. The authors had discarded the\npossibility of using the latter because it had no bearing on their research topic.\nNevertheless, we believe that it is interesting to measure the number of news stories\nmentioning homeopathy (in some part of the body copy) but without focusing on the\ntopic, insofar as this offers a broader idea of the therapy\u2019s visibility in the Spanish\nmedia.\nTo validate the data coding method, two researchers held several meetings to agree on the characteristics of each category. Subsequently, Cronbach\u2019s alpha was used to assess the internal consistency coefficient (0.904) of a random sample of 20.6% (n = 344).\nThe headlines of the main Spanish digital dailies \u2014 specifically, those with the largest\nreadership [Negredo, Vara and Amoedo,\n[\n2017\n](#X0-NegredoVaraAmoedo2017urldate)\n] that had published over 30 news stories\non homeopathy during the three-year study period \u2014 were analyzed in depth\n(Table\n[\n1\n](#x1-130011)\n). Since the Digital News Report [Negredo, Vara and Amoedo,\n[\n2017\n](#X0-NegredoVaraAmoedo2017urldate)\n] ranks\n\u201cRegional or local newspaper websites in general\u201d as the third most consulted\nsource,\nEl Periodico de Catalunya\nwas also included to this category due to the\nnumber of news stories it had published (50 during the three-year period) and\nbecause it has been studied previously [Escrib\u00e0-Sales, Corti\u00f1as-Rovira and\nAlonso-Marcos,\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015)\n]. In addition to the viewpoint used, this analysis included the\ntype of story (data retrieved from the database and verified), i.e., information,\nopinion, interview or others, and the publication frequency during the study\nperiod.\nPearson\u2019s 2 test was used to check the correlations between the information trends and the most read digital dailies, the genre (information, opinion, interview or others), and the date of publication.\n5\n[\n]\nResults\nThroughout the three-year study period, the headlines of these eight digital dailies dealing\nwith homeopathy were, on the whole, skeptical (40%) or neutral (33%), while\nfavorable (15%) or equidistant (12%) approaches were less frequent. However,\nthe results by year (Figure\n[\n1\n](#x1-140011)\n) reveal an evolution in both the news treatment of\nhomeopathy and the number of news stories published on the subject. While in 2015,\n320 homeopathy-related news stories were published and the most prevalent\nslant on headlines was neutral (44%), in 2016 their number increased to 532, with\nthe skeptical approach now being more frequent (41%) in headlines. Lastly, in\n2017, the number of stories almost tripled (821), with the skeptical approach\ngaining further ground (44%) in headlines. In light of the results of Pearson\u2019s\n2 test, there was a\nsignificant correlation (\n2\n= 33.384; p = 0.000; n = 1,673) between the year of publication and how homeopathy-related\nheadlines were addressed.\nThe temporal distribution of the stories (Figure\n[\n2\n](#x1-140022)\n) reveals a similar pattern over the\nthree years, with August being the month when these were fewer and March and June\nthose when the largest number was published. Figure\n[\n2\n](#x1-140022)\nshows the developments that the\nmedia deemed the most newsworthy:\n-\nIn 2015, the largest number of stories on homeopathy was published in April\nand coverage of headlines was mostly neutral. Specifically, the peak in media\ncoverage coincided with the announcement of the construction of a private\nhospital in Madrid that would offer homeopathy services (Figure\n[2](#x1-140022), A).\n-\nIn 2016, the largest number of stories was published in March and coverage\nof headlines was mainly skeptical. The increase in news during this month\ncoincided with the closure of the master\u2019s degree program in Homeopathy\noffered by the University of Barcelona (Figure\n[2](#x1-140022), B).\n-\nIn 2017, there was a peak in coverage between April and July, due to the following\ndevelopments:\n-\nWorld Homeopathy Day took place on April 10. Skeptical groups took\nadvantage of this to launch social media awareness campaigns (Figure\n[2](#x1-140022), C). Furthermore, the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology report, [Fundaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola para la Ciencia y la Tecnolog\u00eda, [2017](#X0-FECYT2017urldate)], revealing that half of the respondents believed in homeopathy, was also published that month (Figure [2](#x1-140022), D).\n-\nIn May, the Colleges of Physicians of Las Palmas and Madrid closed\ntheir homeopathy sections. Additionally, the death in Italy of a child with\notitis, who had been treated exclusively using homeopathy (Figure\n[2](#x1-140022), a), received a great deal of media coverage.\n-\nIn June, the College of Physicians of Barcelona began proceedings\nagainst five doctors for publicly stating that they had cured cancer\nwith alternative therapies (Figure\n[2](#x1-140022), b). Similarly, the Royal Academy of Pharmacy released a statement warning that homeopathy posed a health risk to citizens (Figure [2](#x1-140022), c).\n-\nIn July, the month with the largest number of stories, the regional health\nminister for the Valencian Community issued a statement in which\nshe said that homeopathy was not medicine and urged the central\ngovernment not to recognize it legally as such (Figure\n[2](#x1-140022), d).\n- World Homeopathy Day took place on April 10. Skeptical groups took advantage of this to launch social media awareness campaigns (Figure\nNevertheless, during this three-year period there were a number of policy developments that, despite having a great impact on Spanish law, did not receive as much coverage as the ones described above. For instance, in February 2017 the political party Ciudadanos (liberals) put forward a nonbinding legislative proposal with the aim of obliging medical practitioners to report colleagues who resorted to alternative therapies. In addition, in September 2017, the parliamentary Health Committee rejected the proposal and the Cabinet decided to delegate responsibilities and powers of decision in this regard to the country\u2019s regional governments.\nAn analysis of the eight most-read digital dailies publishing the largest number of\nhomeopathy-related news stories reveals that the genre most used was information\n(Figure\n[\n3\n](#x1-140033)\n). However,\nEl Pa\u00eds\nand\nEl Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya\nstand out because they\npublished the greatest number of opinion pieces on the subject, the latter, above all, for\npublishing more opinion pieces than news stories. In this connection, it should also be\nnoted that\nABC\nonly published news stories. As for interviews, they were generally few\nand far between.\nExcept for El Confidencial and La Vanguardia , publication frequency increased over the three-year study period, exponentially in some cases (from 2015 to 2016 in the case of ABC and El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya , for example), with the exception of 20Minutos and Eldiario.es , which in 2016 published fewer stories than in 2015 and 2017.\nSecond, regarding the classification of the headlines\u2019 treatment of tone (Figure\n[\n4\n](#x1-140044)\n),\nEl\nPa\u00eds\nand\nEl Confidencial\nexpressed theirs in skeptical terms. During the three-year period,\nas a matter of fact, skeptical headlines became more commonplace, to the detriment of\nfavorable ones, with the exception of\n20Minutos\n, which published a higher number\nof favorable headlines in 2017. The case of\nEl Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya\ndeserves\nspecial mention in this regard, as it changed its stance from not publishing any\nequidistant or skeptical headlines in 2015, to publishing mainly skeptical ones in\n2017.\nAccording to the results of Pearson\u2019s 2 test, there was a significant correlation between the eight digital dailies and how they addressed headlines on homeopathy-related stories ( 2 = 40.886; p = 0.006; n = 475) and the news genre ( 2 = 91.042; p = 0.000; n = 475). However, there was no significant correlation among the dailies, the news genre and the viewpoint ( 2 = 6.358 p = 0.704; n = 475).\nThe correlation between the news genre and how headlines were addressed was also analyzed in the study database, but no statistically significant correlations were found ( 2 = 8.922; p = 0.444). It was decided not to perform a comparative analysis of all the digital dailies and their individual viewpoint because some had published few stories, which would have invalidated the statistical conclusions.\n6\n[\n]\nDiscussion\nIt is interesting to note the increase in the number of homeopathy-related stories during the study period. For example, nearly as many stories were published in 2017 as in 2015 and 2016 together. The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that in 2015 homeopathy was still a marginal topic for the media, whereas by 2017 it had become newsworthy. The fact that homeopathy has found its way onto the political agenda has increased public awareness of the issue. There is growing concern among the Spanish government and political establishment about the legal status of CAM, and a general consensus on the need to crack down on its practice in the public health system.\nThe viewpoint of headlines of homeopathy-related stories published in eight Spanish\ndigital dailies from 2015 to 2017 tended to be skeptical (40%), a tendency that increased\nover the period. For instance, this can be illustrated by comparing the treatment of\nheadlines in April 2015 with that in April 2017, the month during which World\nHomeopathy Day takes place. While it received no media coverage in April 2015, it\ndid indeed in April 2017, most headlines being skeptical. However, in terms\nof opinions or facts, information was still the most popular genre, coinciding\nwith Escrib\u00e0-Sales, Corti\u00f1as-Rovira and Alonso-Marcos [\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015)\n], except in the\ncase of\nEl Peri\u00f3dico Catalunya\n, which published the greatest number of opinion\npieces.\nIf the analysis of the slant or tone of headlines of homeopathy-related stories were\nrestricted to those appearing in the five digital dailies (\nEl Pa\u00eds\n,\nEl Mundo\n,\nABC\n,\nLa\nVanguardia\n, and\nEl Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya\n) selected in a previous study [Escrib\u00e0-Sales,\nCorti\u00f1as-Rovira and Alonso-Marcos,\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015)\n], the results for the period 2015\u20132017 would be\n15% equidistant (i.e., ambivalent), 66% skeptical and 19% favorable, out of a\ntotal of 316 stories. To obtain these results, the data corresponding to the neutral\ncategory not included in the study performed by Escrib\u00e0-Sales, Corti\u00f1as-Rovira\nand Alonso-Marcos [\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015)\n] were eliminated from the sample. Thus, it may be\nclaimed that the media coverage of headlines of homeopathy-related stories\nwas generally more skeptical (from 50% to 66%) than favorable (from 25% to\n19%).\nIn their study, Escrib\u00e0-Sales, Corti\u00f1as-Rovira and Alonso-Marcos [\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015)\n] singled out\nLa Vanguardia\nfor its mainly ambivalent coverage from 2009 to 2014. In the period\n2015\u20132017, 14% of headlines of homeopathy-related stories appearing in this digital daily\nwere equidistant, while most were skeptical (42%). These data confirm the skeptical drift\nof the digital press. From 2009 to 2014\nEl Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya\n, for its part, stood out for\nits position in favor of this alternative therapy [Escrib\u00e0-Sales, Corti\u00f1as-Rovira and\nAlonso-Marcos,\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015)\n], but during the period 2015\u20132017 its stance changed abruptly, with\n57% (15/26) of the headlines of homeopathy-related stories that it published in 2017 taking\na skeptical line.\nThere is no scientific evidence that homeopathy is more effective than placebos. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have been performed to discover whether its therapeutic effect on any number of pathologies is greater than in placebo control groups. Strictly speaking, nor can it be regarded as harmless when used as a substitute for conventional treatments. Quite the contrary, it can endanger the health of patients who stop taking scientifically endorsed drugs in favor of homeopathic pills with no proven therapeutic effects.\nOn the other hand, the regulations governing the marketing of homeopathic products and the professional training of therapists differ from country to country. For example, EU Member States such as France and Germany have included homeopathy in their health systems, as well as introducing specific official training courses for therapists. Lastly, from a business perspective, this alternative therapy could be considered a health fraud scam, since pills containing no active ingredient are being sold at high prices, solely on the strength of the supposed \u201cwater memory\u201d effect.\nTherefore, the study of the news coverage of homeopathy in digital dailies, which\nleaves its mark on social networks and other similar spaces, is an effective way of\nidentifying its positive or negative bias at any given time. In relation to previous studies\nof the effects of media coverage on scientific issues [Brewer,\n[\n2013\n](#X0-Brewer2013)\n; Jang,\n[\n2014\n](#X0-Jang2014)\n;\nChang,\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Chang2015)\n; Knobloch-Westerwick et al.,\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Knobloch-WesterwickJohnsonSilveretal2015)\n], it may be stated that the media\nlegitimize scientific discourses and conceal or discredit those sources that defend\nhomeopathy, which coincides with the situation described by Caldwell [\n[\n2017\n](#X0-Caldwell2017)\n] in the\nU.K. On the other hand, according to the studies performed by Chang [\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Chang2015)\n],\nJang [\n[\n2014\n](#X0-Jang2014)\n] and Knobloch-Westerwick et al. [\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Knobloch-WesterwickJohnsonSilveretal2015)\n], individuals are interested in\nscience news that contradicts, in some way, their existing knowledge. The fact\nthat homeopathy sales have dropped, in the midst of this media vortex, and the\nindignation of the skeptical media coverage, points to a possible relationship\nbetween these two facts. Further studies should be conducted to explore this\nphenomenon.\n7\n[\n]\nConclusions\nPrevious studies [Escrib\u00e0-Sales, Corti\u00f1as-Rovira and Alonso-Marcos,\n[\n2015\n](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015)\n] showed that\n50% of the homeopathy-related stories published in five flagship Spanish digital dailies (\nEl\nPa\u00eds\n,\nEl Mundo\n,\nABC\n,\nLa Vanguardia\n, and\nEl Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya\n) were skeptical. A\nsimilar trend has been revealed in 391 headlines of homeopathy-related stories published\nin eight Spanish digital dailies during three years (2015\u20132017). Thus, it could be confirmed\nthat the country\u2019s digital press is contributing to debunking homeopathy and building a\npublic image against the practice. At the same time, the media\u2019s skeptical stance on\nhomeopathy mirrored the central position in the agenda issues, which the political\nestablishment defended during at least the last two years of this study. Hence, the\npro-science stance of the eight digital dailies that questioned the effectiveness of\nhomeopathy was intensified in Spain during the period analyzed, increasing the\nskeptical approach by 16%, to reach 66% of the total number of the headlines\npublished.\nThis skeptical perspective of the headlines coincided with (a) the agreement reached by\nthe main Spanish political parties not to allocate public funding to CAM initiatives and to\nissue public statements underscoring the lack of scientific evidence supporting\nhomeopathy; (b) a social debate on homeopathy, mainly promoted by the skeptical\nmovement, as already noted, with the issue gradually attracting more media coverage;\nand (c) a drop in sales of homeopathic products due to lower demand [Vigario,\n[\n2017\n](#X0-Vigario2017urldate)\n].\nThe eight Spanish digital dailies analyzed here shared a skeptical viewpoint in most of its headlines of homeopathy-related stories, contributing to spreading the idea that the sale of homeopathic products was a scam and tantamount to throwing one\u2019s money down the drain, due to the lack of scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness. In this sense, that dailies have been demanding that policymakers regulate these homeopathic products was appropriate to protecting and promoting public health. Therefore, not only did the media unite in a common cause with colleges of chemists, pharmacists and biologists, but scientists from other fields also entered the fray, lobbying the public administration to ban the sale of homeopathic products in pharmacies and to disavow medical practitioners who prescribed them. In light of the above conclusion, it is evident that dailies have been disseminating signals to public opinion about the end of the lack of the regulatory control of homeopathic treatments, at the same time as policymakers began to take measures to improve the governance of practitioners and consumers. Limitations of this work lie in its analytic assertions. Since the aim here was to analyze manually the homeopathy-related news stories published in 391 digital media outlets over a three-year period, it was only possible to focus on the headlines and not on the body copy. In addition, the possibility of performing a more meticulous content analysis on the remainder of the stories\u2019 elements was rejected in the end.\nIn future research, it would be interesting to discover what the public and physicians think about homeopathic treatment and whether it is connected with media discourse, while also comparing these results with those obtained during the period coinciding with the social campaign against homeopathy launched in the U.K. and Australia. This would enable us to gauge whether the level of public rejection or lack of political and social legitimacy of homeopathy was a consequence of the media\u2019s endorsement of the views of the scientific community in this respect.\n[\n]\nAcknowledgments\n[\n]\nThis paper is exploratory research of the project \u201cStudy, taxonomic and coverage of complementary, alternative, natural therapies on media and social networking.
