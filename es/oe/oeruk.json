Enhanced services include \nnutrition, health education, and psychosocial services \nin addition to routine obstetric care. These enhanced \nservices have been shown to reduce the incidence of low birth weight and reduce overall costs when \ncompared to routine obstetric care. \nThe CPSP client receives ongoing orientation, \nassessment, care plan development, and case \ncoordination, in addition to appropriate nutrition, \nhealth education, and psychosocial interventions and referrals from a multidisciplinary team. \nThe CPSP provider must personally supervise all  \nCPSP services. Personal supervision may occur in person or via electronic means. The provider must \ndirectly supervise comprehensive perinatal health \nworkers and document this supervision in the patient\u2019s record. Direct supervision must take place \nin person and on-site. The provider\u2019s protocols must \ndefine how each type of supervision takes place  and is documented. \nCPSP enhanced services are provided with the client\u2019s \ninput so that each client receives the information, services, and support she needs. It is important to \npersonalize the information and services offered \nto each client, and to respect her social, cultural, religious, and economic concerns. Purpose of Steps to Take \nGuidelines\nThe purpose of these guidelines is to provide \nCPSP staff members, who are neither registered \ndietitians nor masters-prepared social workers or \nhealth educators, with the information they need to effectively assess situations, provide interventions, \nand refer appropriately. These are guidelines for \nmany topics common to pregnancy, however, they do not address all pregnancy-related topics or high-\nrisk issues. High-risk clients should be referred to \nappropriate professional staff.\nDue to the wide variety of CPSP programs and  \nstaff, it is highly recommended that you modify  \nand adapt these guidelines according to your staff and client needs. These guidelines should \nsupplement and enhance your existing CPSP \nprotocols and high-risk situations should be addressed in your on-site CPSP protocols. The Comprehensive Perinatal Services Program  \n(CPSP) Provider Handbook offers extensive \ninformation on the requirements of CPSP and \nincludes useful tools for developing  and maintaining your CPSP practice. For more information on the CPSP Provider Handbook,  \ncontact the local Perinatal Services Coordinator  \n(PSC) in your county.\nPage updated 2019 FS  |  4\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSThere are five main sections: First Steps, Health \nEducation, Nutrition, Psychosocial, and Gestational \nDiabetes. There is also a Postpartum Index and \nChecklist to use when providing postpartum care.\nIt is helpful for staff new to CPSP to read First Steps.How to Use Steps to T ake Guidelines\nFirst Steps\nThere are no client handouts in the First Steps \nsection. This section is not written for clients, but \nfor those who deliver CPSP services. This section \nprovides guidance on program elements such as the orientation and care plan, and includes guidelines \non how to deliver CPSP services to meet the diverse \nneeds of the client.\nHealth Education, Nutrition, \nPsychosocial, and Gestational \nDiabetes \nIf you do not have health education, psychosocial, \nnutrition, or gestational diabetes expertise, the Steps \nto Take guidelines will help you screen and provide \ninterventions for situations related to these elements of prenatal care. In general, each guideline includes: \nn Goals \nn Back ground information \nn St eps to take \nn F ollow up \nn Referrals\nClient handoutsThere are client education handouts for many of \nthe Health Education, Nutrition, Psychosocial, and \nGestational Diabetes topics. The guidelines will refer to related client handouts in Steps to Take. When \nreferenced, handouts appear in italics. For example, \nNausea: Tips that Help is a handout in the Nutrition section. Handouts are available in English and \nSpanish.\nUse these handouts when you discuss a topic with \nthe client. The best way to use them is to read and \ndiscuss them with the client. If you send materials \nhome with a client, be sure she can read and understand them, or has someone who can read \nthem for her. Feel free to use other written materials to supplement \nthe handouts. See the Low Literacy Skills guideline in \nFirst Steps to learn how to choose effective handouts. \nYou may need to translate handouts into the languages most used by clients.\nPage updated 2019 FS  |  5\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSUse these Steps to Take guidelines with your office \nprotocols, which are your facility\u2019s procedures \nfor delivering CPSP health education, nutrition, \nand psychosocial services, as well as related case coordination.T able of Contents\nIntroduction  ....................................... 3\nHow to Use Steps To Take Guidelines  ............... 4\nEssential Elements of Every Client Interaction  ...... 7\nOrientation to Your Services  ....................... 9\nAssessment  ....................................... 13\nIndividual Care Plan  ............................... 15\nEducating Effectively  ............................. 17\nMaking Successful Referrals  ....................... 19\nDeveloping a Community Resource List  .......... 21 \nWomen, Infants, and Children (WIC)  \nSupplemental Nutrition Program  .............. 23\nDocumentation Guidelines  ....................... 25\nApproaching Clients of Different Ages  ............ 27\nHelping a Client Make Decisions  .................. 29 \nHelping a Client with Behavior Change  ........... 31\nCultural Considerations  ........................... 33\nCross-Cultural Communication  ................... 35\nDealing with Language Barriers  ................... 37\nGuidelines for Using Interpreters  .................. 45\nLow Literacy Skills  ................................ 47\nClients with Alternative Health Care  \nExperiences  ................................... 49This page intentionally left blank FS  |  7\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSEssential Elements of  Every Client Interaction\nCPSP is a client-centered program. Each client has  \nher own unique concerns, way of learning, \nexperience, knowledge, strengths, and risks.here are essential elements to remember \nevery time a CPSP staff person works with \na client. These are:\nn B elieve that each client can help herself\nn F ocus on the client\nn L ook for the client\u2019s strengths and build on them\nn K eep an open mind\nn Suppor t the client\u2019s right to choose\nSteps to Take\nn Believe that each client can help herself\n I t is commonly accepted that the health care \npractitioner can help the client. However, the \nmost effective interventions occur when both the \nhealth care practitioner and the client believe in \nthe client\u2019s ability to help herself. \n Once the client lea ves your office, she only has \nherself to rely upon. When staff show confidence in the client and the client\u2019s abilities, the client is \nmore likely to trust the staff and participate in the \nplan. For example:\nu T ake time to ask the client how she is feeling. \nReally listen to her as an individual. \nu L ook at the client, rather than looking \nthrough the chart, typing on the computer, or arranging pamphlets.\n B elieving that the client can truly help herself \nleads to the next step: focus on the client. \nn Focus on the client \n B y believing the client can help herself, the focus \nnaturally shifts away from the CPSP staff and toward the client; first by understanding and \nidentifying her goals and then by helping her to \nachieve them. \n No matt er what the issue is, begin by finding out \nwhat the client knows, what questions she has, her level of experience, and how she prefers to learn. Then, help her decide what more she needs to learn and provide her with the knowledge and \nskills she needs to help herself. For example:\nu Encourage the client t o bring up her concerns \nor questions in the beginning.\nu Encourage her t o write a list of questions to \nask the health care practitioner, so she can \nbetter remember them.\nu P rovide support and encouragement to a \nclient who, for example, is very nervous at 15 weeks of pregnancy because her last \npregnancy ended in a miscarriage at 16 \nweeks. It may be more appropriate not to spend time on other areas of her health \neducation plan at this time.\nu D esign a different health education plan for a \nclient who has never had a baby and prefers \nto read, as opposed to a woman who has had \ntwo babies and finds reading difficult.\nn Look for her strengths and build on them \n E very client has strengths. However, health  \ncare practitioners are trained to look for problems and solve them, so it takes a conscious effort to \nshift away from looking for risks to also looking  for strengths. \n When an int eraction \u201cfocuses on the client,\u201d it is \na two-way discussion during which some of the client\u2019s strengths will become evident. When \na CPSP staff person comments on the client\u2019s \nstrengths, the client\u2019s confidence in her ability to help herself increases. For example:\nu C ommend a client who called in after \nspotting for two days. Her strength is that  she understood that she should be checked. FS  |  8\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSEssential Elements of  Every Client Interaction\nUse that understanding to teach her about \ncalling right away if she feels any danger signs \nin the future.\nu A client ma y not know the anatomical names \nof her reproductive organs, she may have a \nlot of experience in supporting other women \nduring their pregnancies. Her strength is \nthat she knows what to expect as her body changes.\nu A client ma y continue to smoke or use other \ndrugs throughout her pregnancy. Even if she is risking her health and the health of \nher baby, she has the right to make those \ndecisions. Praise her for taking an interest in her pregnancy; encourage her to attend all of  \nher appointments and to decrease her smoking/drug use to lessen the risks to herself and the baby.\nn Keep an open mind\n When talk ing with a client, take care to keep your \nown values and opinions out of the picture, even if some of her attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors seem \nnew or unusual to you. For example:\nu List en with an open mind to cultural or \nreligious beliefs about food or activities. This \ninformation will help when making a plan for \nthe client\u2019s care.\nu E ven if a client is behaving in ways that you \nthink are not appropriate for a pregnant \nwoman (using drugs, not married, etc.), praise \nher for showing interest in her baby\u2019s health \nby seeking prenatal care.\nn Support the client\u2019s right to choose\n Each w oman has the right to decide if she will \nparticipate in CPSP . All CPSP services are voluntary and a client can turn down any or all parts of \nthese services. For example:\nu A client ma y choose not to learn all the details of labor and delivery. Accept that she prefers \nto let nature take its course.\nu A client can choose who she wants t o involve \nin her care. After explaining the client\u2019s right to confidential medical records and any legal \nlimitations, it is important to explain what will \nbe discussed in the visits so she can decide if she would like others to be involved in \nher care. For example, explain the sensitive \ntopics that will be discussed in each visit such as history of past pregnancies, substance \nuse, intimate partner violence, and sexually \ntransmitted infections. Then, the client can knowingly choose if/when she wants to \ninclude others in her care.\nu A ccept a client\u2019s choice to quit school and \nstay home for the last three months of her \npregnancy even though she is in good health.\nPage updated 2019 FS  |  9\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSOrientation to Y our Services\nOrientation explains what the client can expect from \nCPSP services and should be provided during the \nclient\u2019s first visit to your clinic or office. rientation to other patient services may \nalso be offered later in the pregnancy or \npostpartum when needed; for example, \ndescribing a procedure such as amniocentesis, or \nexplaining how to prepare for her first ultrasound are \nboth examples of orientation on new topics and can \nbe documented using orientation units.\nWhat to Discuss with a  \nNew CPSP Client\nInform the client that all services are voluntary and \nshe may accept or decline any services. During your \ninitial orientation, ideally done during the first visit, \ndiscuss the topics below with the client.\nThese topics are covered in the Welcome to  \nPregnancy Care handout in the Health Education \nsection of this manual.

Give \nher the handouts If Your Labor Starts Too Early and Count Your Baby\u2019s Kicks from the Health \nEducation section of this manual. \nOrientation Handouts\nWhen you perform an orientation on the first visit, give \nthe client an orientation handout, such as Welcome \nto Pregnancy Care (see the Health Education section of this manual). To emphasize a point, write on the pamphlet. Some items you might write down are: \nnames of staff members or locations of related services \n(WIC, etc.). When you give handouts to a client, ask her to keep them readily available in case she needs \nthe list of danger signs, phone numbers, or other \ninformation. Be sure your name, address, and phone number are on the handout.\nHow to document orientation\nIf all of the orientation is provided in one visit, write a \nshort note in the progress notes of the client\u2019s chart or on the assessment form, including:\nn Dat e of orientation \nn P rovider signature and title\nn T ime spent in minutes \nFor example:  1/12/16, orientation per protocol,  \nJ.

Education \nmaterials and consent forms are available to help families understand basic prenatal screening and \ndiagnosis information for some birth defects. FS  |  13\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSAssessment\nSee the CPSP Provider Handbook \n(Chapter 2) for information on assessment \nguidelines and requirements.he purpose of CPSP assessments is to \nidentify the client\u2019s issues, strengths, and \nlearning and resource needs in order to \ndevelop a plan for the best pregnancy outcome. \nIt is best for women to begin care as early in the \npregnancy as possible so that the initial assessment \noccurs early in the first trimester. The initial nutrition, health education, and psychosocial assessments \nshould be completed within four weeks of entry to \ncare. Additional assessments should be conducted in the second and third trimester and postpartum. \nCPSP providers complete all assessments in face-\nto-face interviews. Each assessment area (nutrition, psychosocial, and health education) should be a \nminimum of 30 minutes or a combined three-part \nassessment totaling at least 90 minutes (all three of the support disciplines must be assessed).\nCPSP providers must conduct assessments that \naddress all elements required by Title 22. The Provider Handbook includes a list of these elements. All \nassessments and changes to assessment forms must \nbe reviewed by the local area Perinatal Services Coordinator (PSC) for compliance with Title 22. PSCs \ncan provide sample assessment forms that include \nall required elements. Providers must also allow for periodic updates to the assessments to comply with \nbest practices.\nAfter completing an assessment, the CPSP provider \nand the client should develop an Individualized Care \nPlan (ICP) to address the needs of the client. CPSP \nassessments and reassessments may identify complex conditions best addressed by a registered dietitian, \nmaster\u2019s prepared psychosocial practitioner or a \nmaster\u2019s prepared health educator. It is a best practice to refer clients with complex conditions to these \nexperts for in-depth assessment, intervention, and \nreferrals as needed. Instructions on these procedures are included in your site-specific protocols.Follow up and completed reassessments are  required by regulations. These should be done at \neach trimester and postpartum.\nAssessments and Reassessments\nAll CPSP services are voluntary. If a client declines the \nassessment, you must document this in her medical \nrecord. Continue to offer assessments or other CPSP \nservices at subsequent visits when you feel she may be ready to participate. Document each invitation to \nparticipate in CPSP services and the client\u2019s response.\nGuidelines for interviewing\nn T he setting should be private and ideally  \nhave a phone for communicating with  \noutside resources.\nn T ry to put the client at ease. Introduce yourself \nand explain the purpose of the assessment.\nn A dopt a nonjudgmental, relaxed attitude.\nn T ell the client that her responses are part of  \nher confidential medical record and will not  be shared outside the health care team, with  \na few exceptions:\nu I f she has a plan to hurt herself or others.\nu I f she has physical injuries as a result of assault \nor abuse.\nu I f there is suspicion of abuse/neglect of a \nchild, elder, or dependent adult.\nn A sk open-ended questions to get information; \nthat is, questions that require more than a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer. For example: \nu Star t with, \u201cHow do you prefer to learn new \nthings?\u201d instead of, \u201cDo you like to read?\u201d\nu T ry, \u201cWhat do you know about breastfeeding?\u201d \ninstead of, \u201cDo you plan to breastfeed?\u201d \nPage updated 2019 FS  |  14\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSAssessment\nu Use , \u201cHow does your partner feel about your \npregnancy?\u201d instead of, \u201cIs your partner happy \nabout your pregnancy?\u201d\nn F ocus on the client, not the form. Try not to read \nthe assessment form word for word. Use words and phrases that you feel comfortable with and \nthat are culturally appropriate for the client. \nMaintain frequent eye contact while completing the form.\nn T ake special care to fill in an answer to every \nquestion. Do not leave any questions blank. If a client does not want to answer, document \u201cclient \ndeclined to answer.\u201d\nn A sk sensitive questions in an accepting, \nstraightforward manner. Clients often report \nsensing when they are being judged. Be aware \nof your own attitudes and body language. Most \nclients are willing to answer, especially if they understand why the question is being asked. \nExplain that responses are voluntary; she may \nchoose not to answer a specific question.  FS  |  15\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSIndividual Care Plan\nSee the CPSP Provider Handbook  \n(Chapter 2) for sample Individual Care  \nPlan (ICP) tools and further information  \non completing the ICP .he ICP is an effective tool for coordinating \na CPSP client\u2019s perinatal care. The ICP is \ndeveloped from information obtained \nduring the client\u2019s initial assessment and is updated \nat each trimester and at postpartum. The CPSP \npractitioner and the client develop the ICP together \nto document the client\u2019s strengths, identify goals and appointments that address her perceived resource \nneeds, and to prioritize her risk conditions. \nThe ICP may also include referrals to outside agencies. \nReferrals should include the name of the agency, \ncontact person (if any), and phone number. Follow \nup on referrals is documented on the ICP during reassessments or any other contact with the client.\nAll CPSP providers must use an ICP that meets Title 22 \nrequirements. The PSC can provide samples of ICPs that meet the guidelines. \nThe required elements of the ICP are as follows:\nn R isk conditions and problems: The obstetric, \nnutrition, psychosocial, and health education \nassessments help determine a client\u2019s health  \nrisks and resource needs. Conditions prioritized \non the ICP should be unique to the client.  Risk conditions and problems are identified \nthrough the assessment, discussed and  \nprioritized with the client, and documented  in the ICP by the practitioner. \nn I nterventions: Teaching, counseling, referrals, \nproblem solving, and any actions to be taken by the client or staff to address risk conditions/\nproblems are noted on the ICP . The ICP should \ninclude who is responsible for carrying out the needed intervention and the associated timelines. \nWhenever appropriate, involve people who \nprovide her social support, such as her partner or a family member. All proposed interventions \nshould take into consideration the client\u2019s cultural \nbackground and linguistic needs.n Client out comes: At a minimum, update the \nICP after each reassessment and indicate the progress achieved to date and any necessary \nmodifications to the plan. Document the results \nof each planned intervention or referral on the ICP . For example, if the problem was smoking, did \nshe attend the smoking cessation class she was \nreferred to? If not, how is the plan going to be revised? Is she using the deep breathing exercises \nyou taught her? What interventions are helping \nher achieve her goal to stop smoking? Is the problem now resolved? \nInterventions provided and documented in the ICP are based on site-specific protocols. The ICP must document all care coordination and follow up for \ninterventions and referrals.This page intentionally left blank FS  |  17\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSEducating Effectivel y\nTeach-back\nAsk the client to \u201cteach-back\u201d the main points. With \nteach-back, you ask the client to teach you/explain \nthe most important part of your message. For \nexample, say:\nn \u201c Just to be sure I have explained the danger signs \nclearly, could you tell me the danger signs you remember and what you will do if you see them?\u201d\nn \u201c What suggestion on this handout seemed like \nsomething you could do to quit smoking?\u201d\nn \u201c Tell me what you will do now to help your \nnausea. \u201ds you educate clients, you can help them \nin the following ways:\nn P rovide necessary information\nn Help clients mak e informed decisions about \ntheir pregnancies (see Helping a Client Make Decisions) \nn M ake linkages to appropriate services (see \nMaking Successful Referrals and Developing a Community Resource List)\nn Help clients change beha viors to have healthier \npregnancies and babies (see Helping a Client with Behavior Change)\nThis section will focus on the first point above, providing information. The goal is to provide information so the client learns what she needs \nto carry out a healthy pregnancy. Keep in mind, \npeople learn in different ways, so no two clients will assimilate information in the same way.\nLearning New Information \nOverall, people remember:\n10% of what they read\n20% of what they hear\n30% of what they see\n50% of what they hear and see\n70% of what they say or write\n90% of what they say as they do a thing\nThe more a person actively uses information, \nthe more they will remember. Passive methods \nof learning, such as reading or listening, are less effective. Use active methods, such as asking the \nclient to practice a skill or having the client explain \nwhat she understands. \nPay attention to the assessment form question \nabout how she likes to learn. One person may like to \nread instructions, while another may prefer having someone explain instructions. Some people may be \nterrified of groups, while others prefer group learning. \nAdjust the way you teach to each client\u2019s learning \npreferences when possible.\nAnother important factor is the client\u2019s interest in \nthe subject. For example, a client in her first trimester \nmay not care about breast or bottle feeding; \nhowever, in her third trimester the same client may be very interested in how she will feed her infant. \nFind out what the client is interested in and provide \ninformation at the relevant time. \nTeaching Effectively\nYou can be a more effective educator by remembering two things: (1) limit and focus the \ninformation you give and (2) involve the client.  \nThe following are some suggestions that will help \nyou involve the client in your education session. \nThe beginning\nn Establish rappor t. Ask the client how she is feeling \nor make a friendly comment. \nn F ind out if she has any concerns, and address  \nher concerns. \nPage updated 2019 FS  |  18\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSEducating Effectivel y\nThe middle: getting and giving information\nn A sk what the client knows/has heard about  \nthis topic.\nu Use a phase such as , \u201cWhat do you know \nabout breastfeeding?\u201d instead of,  \n\u201cDo you plan to breastfeed?\u201d\nn Explain jar gon or unfamiliar words.\nn Giv e only the most essential information in small \n\u201cbite-sized chunks.\u201d\nn A sk questions to find out what the client \nunderstands after explaining a chunk of information.\nn When using a handout:\nu Explain the inf ormation in chunks.  \nName the topic before you give the  \ndetails of each chunk.\nu H ighlight any important points with a pen, \npencil, or colored highlighter. \nu A sk the client to circle or point out what is \nimportant to her.\nn When t eaching skills, show and tell. \nu F or example, show and tell the client  \nhow to use a condom or how to perform \nprenatal exercises.  \nThe end\nn R eview the main points.\nn A sk the client to show you any skills you\u2019ve \ntaught. For example: \nu A sk the client to show you how to do kick \ncounts or safe lifting techniques.\nu A sk the client to how she will ask her partner \nto smoke outside to avoid second hand \nsmoke.n A sk the client to \u201cteach-back\u201d the main points. For \nexample, say:\nu \u201c Just to be sure I have explained the danger \nsigns clearly, could you tell me the danger signs you remember and what you will do if \nyou see them?\u201d\nu \u201c What suggestion on this handout seemed \nlike something you could do to quit smoking?\u201d\nu \u201c Tell me what you will do now to help  \nyour nausea.\u201d\nn A sk the client what questions she has.\nOpen-ended questions\nOne easy way to involve a client is to use open-\nended questions throughout her education.  \nUse open-ended questions whenever you want to \nfind out what a client has learned or knows.  Open-ended questions start with words like, \u201cwhat, \u201d \n\u201ctell me, \u201d or \u201chow. \u201d By using these types of questions, \nyou are not allowing a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer. Instead, you are drawing out a longer response. Try not to start questions with words like, \u201cdo you, \u201d \u201cis, \u201d \u201care, \u201d \nor \u201ccan you?\u201d These beginnings lead to \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d \nanswers. For example: \nn S tart with, \u201cHow do you like to learn new things?\u201d \ninstead of, \u201cDo you like to read?\nn T ry, \u201cWhat will you do when you want to count \nyour baby\u2019s kicks?\u201d instead of, \u201cCan you count your baby\u2019s kicks?\u201d \nn U se, \u201cHow does your partner feel about your \npregnancy?\u201d instead of, \u201cIs your partner happy about your pregnancy?\u201d\nPage updated 2019 FS  |  19\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSMaking Successful R eferrals\nn some cases, you will need to refer \na client to an outside resource that \nspecializes in a particular kind of service or \nfocus area. After making a referral, follow up at a later visit to ensure that the client has followed through. With each referral, be sure to:\nn Explain the benefits of the r eferral and how the \nreferral meets a need she has identified.\nn D escribe the process of the referral (what has to \nhappen before she can receive services).\nn P raise her for taking care of herself.\nTry to relieve any embarrassment she might feel as a result of seeing another practitioner. If she has \nformed an attachment to you, she might be reluctant \nto see someone else. Let her know you will still see her at upcoming prenatal visits. When you or the \nclient calls the referral agency, find out the following \nas necessary:\nn Who is ser ved? Are there any age limits or other \nrestrictions?\nn Ar e people seen on a drop-in basis or is an \nappointment required?\nn Ho w long will it take to get an appointment?\nn Is ther e a waiting list?\nn Is ther e a cost? What is the cost? Is there a sliding \nscale for people who have limited resources?\nn What ar e the staff\u2019s language capabilities?\nn Wher e are their offices located?\nn Which public transpor tation options are nearby?\nn What ar e their hours and days of service? \nYou may need to teach the client how to make an appointment. Show her how to ask for the name of \nthe person she\u2019s being referred to and how to make \nnotes about what she is told.Prepare Her for Barriers She May \nExperience\nAsk if she thinks she will have any problems \nin following through with the referral such as \ntransportation, childcare, or other barriers. Find out if \nthe client has a calendar and a clock to help her keep appointments. See if she has a map, bus schedule or \na corresponding phone application, and be sure she \nknows how to use it to locate the agency. Consider her literacy skills.\nWhat If She Won\u2019t Go?\nDo your best to make an appropriate referral and encourage her to accept it. Ask her to share with \nyou any potential barriers that may keep her from \nfollowing through on the referral. Document your efforts. In cases where the client is a danger to herself \nor others, see Psychosocial Care: Emotional or Mental \nHealth Concerns.\nIf a client thinks she doesn\u2019t need help or he feels \nyou can\u2019t help with her problems, she may not want \nto see someone from an outside agency. Know the limits of your counseling experience and explain \nthose limits to her. Set boundaries. If she becomes \noverly dependent, she will be less likely to accept outside help and receive an appropriate level of care.\nPage updated 2019This page intentionally left blank FS  |  21\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSreate a community resource list to use \nwith clients and include these resources \nin your facility protocols. Your facility \nprotocols should include any referral resources that will help the client meet her needs; referrals should be chosen based on each client\u2019s assessment results \nand client preferences.

In addition to the initial referral, CPSP \nproviders must follow up with CPSP clients to inquire \nabout their experience with the WIC program and/\nor why they chose not to participate. CPSP providers play an important role in supporting and encouraging \nperinatal women to participate in the WIC program.\nWhat is WIC?\nWIC serves women, infants, and children by providing \nnutrition education, breastfeeding support, referrals \nto health and social services, and checks for nutritious foods to eligible families. WIC provides supplemental \nnutrition services in every county in California.\nServices provided\nThe following types of services are provided to eligible \nwomen, infants, and children under 5 years of age:\nn Nutr ition and health education\nn Br eastfeeding promotion and support\nn Nutr itious supplemental foods\nn R eferrals to health care and social services\nWho Is Eligible For WIC Services?\nCategoryPersons in the following categories may be eligible \nfor WIC services:\nn W omen who are pregnant, breastfeeding women \nup to one year after delivery, and non-breastfeeding \nwomen up to six months after delivery\nn I nfants from birth to 1 year of age\nn Childr en one to 5 years of ageIncomeWomen in families with income that is 185% of the \nFederal Poverty Level or less are eligible for WIC. All \nwomen, infants, and children receiving CalFresh (federally known as the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program (SNAP) or Food Stamps) or \nCalWORKS meet the income eligibility criteria for WIC. Most Medi-Cal and Child Health and Disability \nProgram (CHDP) beneficiaries also are income eligible \nfor WIC. Babies and children cared for by fathers, other guardians, or foster parents are also eligible. In \naddition, many working families and migrant families \nmay be eligible. \nNutrition and health indicators\nThe WIC program determines the applicant\u2019s \neligibility based on information provided by the \nhealth care provider and the client describing the client\u2019s nutritional need.\nFederal regulations\nFederal regulations specify that pregnant and \nbreastfeeding women and infants are given the highest priority for program enrollment. Please advise \nclients who are referred that they must provide the \nWIC program with the following information at enrollment:\nn I ncome verification, including any of the \nfollowing:\nu A djunctive eligibility documentation:  \nMedi-Cal benefits, CalWORKS, or CalFresh card\nu O ther documentation: Pay stubs, income tax \nforms, unemployment benefit card\nn R esidence verification, including but not limited \nto current:\nu U tility bills, rent receipts, or bank statements; \npost office boxes are not acceptable\nPage updated 2019 FS  |  24\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSWomen, Infants, and Children (WIC)Supplemental Nutrition Program\nn P ersonal identification, including but not limited \nto current:\nu Dr iver\u2019s license, Medi-Cal benefits identification \ncard, birth certificate, immunization record, \nschool identification card, California \nidentification card, and other documents\nThe client may enroll in the WIC program \nprovisionally without complete information  \nfrom the medical care provider.\nHealth care providers should relay the required \ninformation to the client to the WIC program prior to \nthe enrollment appointment. The information must \nbe recorded 30 days before enrollment of the WIC program (or 90 days in the case of blood work). If it \nis not, WIC staff are required to disqualify the patient \nfrom receiving WIC benefits. Local WIC programs encourage providers to work with them to facilitate \nthe exchange of health information.\nThe required information the health care provider \nshould share with the applicant includes:\nn D ocumentation that the client is receiving CPSP \nservices along with identification (name, address, and phone number) of the CPSP provider\nn A WIC referral form or other form that documents \nthe following:\nu Anthr opometric data (height, current weight, \npregravid [prepregancy] weight, if applicable)\nu Biochemical data (hemoglobin or hemat ocrit)\nu Expec ted date of delivery (EDD), if applicable\nu An y current medical conditions\nThe client should bring proof of income from the last 30 days to their appointment.

At \ndifferent ages, people are in different \nstages of emotional development, physical growth, \nhave different ways of thinking and making decisions, \nand have varying levels of abilities when it comes to \ngetting along with others. Knowing a client\u2019s age and paying attention to how she thinks, makes decisions, \nand relies on others are helpful when choosing the \nmost effective approaches for working with her. \nAdolescents (13-18)\nPregnancy interrupts a teen\u2019s normal growth, development processes, and a crucial stage of \nlife. It requires the teen\u2019s body to expend energy \ndeveloping a new life instead of devoting that energy to her physical growth. A teen also must face the \nadult responsibilities of parenthood when she would \nordinarily be learning how to make decisions and relate to others.\nThinking and reasoning traits\nn An adolescent t ends to make decisions based on \npersonal principles that are heavily influenced by \npeer pressure; decisions are seldom based on fear \nof punishment or fear of adult disapproval.\nn Her vie w of everything is in relation to herself; she \nis self-focused and unable to see herself as others \nsee her; the world revolves around her.\nRelating to others\nn She seeks t o establish herself as an individual, \nwhile at the same time, trying to connect with her peers in order to be accepted.\nRecommended approaches\nn K eep a nonjudgmental attitude.\nn F ocus on \u201cself-care\u201d during pregnancy versus \n\u201ccaring for the baby.\u201d\nn P resent subjects in the here and now, as opposed \nto the future.n A cknowledge the difficulty of mastering \nmotherhood at this time in her life.\nn Use g roup activities such as classes, parties, \ngames, and outings.\nn Use wr itten materials and pictures that are \noriented toward teen language and culture. \nn I ncorporate a variety of teaching methods such \nas movies, computer, music, etc. \nn Use social media and phone r esources if they \nare available (see the Tobacco Use guideline or the SmokeFree.gov resource, which has instant \nmessaging and a mobile phone application \nto help teens stop smoking. The Text for Baby Campaign also sends messages about the \ndifferent stages of pregnancy, etc.)\nn Link with schools , social service agencies,  \nand pediatric facilities.\nn Engage the father of the bab y as much  \nas possible.\nn Use ment ors and peers as appropriate.\nn B e flexible.\nAdults (19-35)\nPregnancy complements the adult\u2019s physical \ngrowth, thinking and reasoning patterns, and social \nrelationships. However, the potential for a short \ninterval between pregnancies and the likelihood of working outside the home may result in the client \nlacking the energy and good health needed for a \nhealthy pregnancy. \nThinking and reasoning traits\nn An adult mak es decisions based on logic and can \nsolve problems and think in an orderly manner.\nn She is r eady to make commitments and set \nrealistic goals; an adult is anxious to achieve, be \nresponsible, and bring different people and ideas \ninto her life.\nPage updated 2019 FS  |  28\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSApproaching Clients of Different Ages\nRelating to others\nn T here is a need to share life with someone  \nelse, a desire to be private, personal, and in  \na close relationship.\nRecommended approaches\nn A ssist her in setting goals and making choices \nand commitments.\nn P resent information in a logical manner.\nn F ocus on the sharing aspect of the experience. \nEncourage the client to include her partner  \nor another support person in her prenatal  \ncare experience.\nn B e sensitive to existing stress and fatigue.\nMature Adults (36-45)\nPregnancy may challenge the mature adult\u2019s place \nin her life cycle, depending on the planned or \nunplanned nature of the pregnancy. If this is a first \npregnancy, her current lifestyle will soon change dramatically; if it is a subsequent pregnancy, \nadded responsibility may stress the client in new \nways. Her age may also place her at higher risk for complications during the pregnancy and for birth \ndefects in the baby. Fatigue comes more quickly and \nprevious pregnancies and/or life experiences may leave her less able to carry pregnancies to term. \nThinking and reasoning traits\nn A matur e adult is capable of thinking about  \nmany things at once and seeing things from \ndifferent perspectives.\nn She is mor e likely to have a strong sense of \u201cself\u201d \nand see herself as an individual.\nRelating to others\nn She is int erested in looking at and evaluating \npreviously made goals.\nRecommended approaches\nn R elate pregnancy needs to her education and  \nlife experiences.n R espect the many questions and concerns she \nmay express.\nn D o not assume she is knowledgeable about \npregnancy because of her chronological age. \nExplore beliefs about pregnancy and introduce \nfactual information as appropriate. \nn B e sensitive to possible feelings of \nembarrassment, shock, self-doubt, or conflicting \nfeelings about the pregnancy. FS  |  29\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSHelping a Client Make Decisions\nome clients may need assistance with \nmaking health-related decisions, such as: \nn T o attend all prenatal appointments or not\nn T o wear a seatbelt or not\nn T o breastfeed or not \nn T o have a newborn boy circumcised or not \nn T o have a baby immunized or not\nn What contraception t o use after the baby is born\nYou can help the client with the steps involved in making a decision, but in the end, the decision is for \nthe client to make.\nIn some cases, the client\u2019s decisions may be \ninfluenced by a family member (such as mother or \nmother-in-law) or by a group (such as her spiritual \nsupport system, co-workers, etc.). Find out who influences her decisions and how strong that \ninfluence is. Take that into consideration when you \ntalk with her about her decisions. Many decisions can be worked out by using the following problem \nsolving technique:\n1. A sk the client to:\nu Stat e her choices clearly\nu List all the benefits and bar riers she can think \nof for each choice\nu Stat e her values as they relate to each choice\n F or example, if a client is trying to decide \nwhether to breastfeed or not, she may tell you \nthat she feels strongly about wanting what is \nbest for her baby. She is also concerned about \nwhether she can make enough milk, her modesty, and a need for independence. \n2.  Clar ify information about her choices to help her \nmake a decision\n F or the client above who is trying to decide whether to breastfeed, you might tell her:\nu Br east size does not determine the quantity of \nbreast milk (frequency of feeding does).\nu O ther people can give a bottle to a breastfed \nbaby (the mother can pump breast milk for a bottle).\nu A w oman\u2019s modesty can be protected and \nher breasts do not have to be exposed during breastfeeding.\n No w the client can re-evaluate her values and \nbeliefs. She can understand how strongly she feels about it and has the information she needs \nto balance with those beliefs.\n3.  I nclude \u201csignificant others\u201d as appropriate.\n A sk the client if she would like to bring a family \nmember or someone important to one or more \noffice visits. Let her know that her supportive \nrelationships are important. For example:\nu I nvite a family member to come along to \nlearn about breastfeeding.\nu I nvite a family member who smokes to come \nalong and learn about ways to help avoid \nexposure to secondhand smoke.\n4. F ollow up with the client about her decision next \ntime you see her. If she still is undecided, let her know it can take time to make a decision and \nrepeat steps 1, 2, and 3 above. \nPage updated 2019This page intentionally left blank FS  |  31\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSHelping a Client with Beha vior Change\nuring her time in prenatal care, a client \nmay want to change her behavior. For \nexample, she may want to change her \nsmoking habits, or her habit of missing scheduled \nprenatal appointments, or the way she handles stress. \nClients do not change their behavior because a CPSP \nstaff person tells them to. CPSP clients are just like CPSP staff; we all change our behavior when we are ready. \nPeople approach a change in behavior in stages.  \nAt some points in time, clients are far away from being ready to change. At other stages, change is  \nthe next step! \nThe Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change  \n(also called the Stages of Change Model) explains \nhow people change.\nWhy is this model helpful to CPSP staff? Once you \nassess which stage a client is in, you can help her \nmove toward her desired change in behavior. \nThe Stages of Change are:\nn Pre-contemplation\nn Contemplation\nn Preparation\nn Action\nn Maintenance\nn Relapse\nThink of these stages as parts of a cycle. Ideally, \nclients move little by little toward trying out their \ndesired behavior. However, clients can also move \naway from the desired behavior. \nPre-contemplation\nThis is the stage furthest away from making a behavior change. In pre-contemplation, clients are \nnot thinking about changing their behavior. Often, \nthey do not want to change because they don\u2019t see the behavior as a problem. A client in this stage may You can assess which stage the client is in by asking \nquestions that encourage her to explain how she feels \nabout changing her behavior. \nsay, \u201cI don\u2019t think I need to stop smoking. I smoked all \nthrough my first pregnancy and my daughter is now \n6 years old and has no problems.\u201d\nTo help a client in this stage: Discuss the problem \nin the abstract. Do not talk about the client\u2019s \nbehavior, but talk in a general way about other \npeople who have felt the same way. Talk about statistics. The goal is to give the client some food \nfor thought, so she can move to the next stage, \ncontemplation.\nContemplation:\nIn the contemplation stage, people begin to think about changing their behavior. A client in this stage \nmay say, \u201cYes, I know I should stop smoking, BUT\u2026\u201d\nTo help a client in this stage: Discuss the pros \nand cons of changing behavior. Help the client to \nbrainstorm ways to overcome each con. The goal is to \nhelp the client feel she can overcome the cons, so she can move to the next stage and prepare to change.\nPreparation:\nIn this stage, a client is preparing to take action in the immediate future. She has taken some steps toward \nchanging her behavior. Her preparations may include \ntalking to others to get advice or support, or setting a personal goal such as cutting down to fewer cigarettes.\nTo help a client in this stage: Applaud her \npreparations. Discuss any barriers she foresees in making her desired change and brainstorm ways that \nshe can overcome them. The goal is to help her make \na plan to overcome any barriers and move to the next stage \u2013 action. \nPage updated 2019 FS  |  32\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSHelping a Client with Beha vior Change\nAction:  \nIn the action stage, the client is changing her \nbehavior. She is trying her new behavior. \nTo help a client in this stage: Applaud her actions. \nThe goal is to help her continue her new behavior and prevent relapse. Discuss any barriers she foresees \nin continuing her desired change. You might ask, \n\u201cWhat is the hardest part about (your new behavior)?\u201d Brainstorm ways that she can overcome the barriers. \nReinforce the benefits of her new behavior. You \nmight ask, \u201cWhat is the best part about (your new behavior)?\u201d \nMaintenance:  \nIn the maintenance stage, a client has made the change and continued it for six months. \nTo help a client in this stage: Continue to give the \nclient encouragement and praise. Remind her of the benefits. Brainstorm solutions to any barriers.\nRelapse:  \nA client may relapse after changing her behavior when she encounters a setback. Depending on the \nstrength of the setback, she may go back to any of \nthe stages of change. \nTo help a client in relapse: Be understanding. \nExplain that relapse is common, and that it usually \ntakes a person several tries to make a behavior change that is well integrated into their life. Talk with \nthe client to find out which stage she is in now.  \nGuide her using the suggestions for that stage. \nRemember, behavior change occurs over time. \nIdeally, CPSP clients are seen multiple times \nthroughout their pregnancy and into the postpartum period. In these visits, CPSP staff have a unique \nopportunity to help clients move closer to changing \ntheir behavior by nudging them along the stages  of change.\nPage updated 2019 FS  |  33\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSCultural Considerations\nPSP is designed to provide individualized \nservices to each client. One important \nconsideration is being sensitive to the \nclient\u2019s culture. Culture may be thought of as a way of life belonging to a particular group of people. It includes behaviors, attitudes, values, and beliefs that \nare shared by that group and passed down from \ngeneration to generation. There is linguistic and cultural diversity within a particular ethnic group, \nand there are differences in the extent to which \nan individual practices her cultural behaviors or traditions.\nOne of the most important cultural influences for the \nclient is her ethnic background, but she may be part of other groups that have cultural influence on her \nlife. These include her religion, education, social and \neconomic status, citizenship or immigration status, age, sexual orientation, marital status, her original \nfamily and current family structures, where she was \nraised or lives (urban, rural, suburban), emotional status, current trends, and lifestyle. All of these factors \ninfluence her health, beliefs, and practices.\nIf you are not familiar with a certain culture, let \nthe client know. Show respect for her culture and \nexpress your interest in learning more about the \nbeliefs and values associated with that culture. See Cross Cultural Communication to find techniques \nfor communicating with someone from a culture \ndifferent from your own.\nWe all have personal beliefs and tend to make \njudgments about other people. Avoid negative \nstereotypes of different groups of people such as ethnic groups, women on welfare, and people \naddicted to substances. Be aware of your own \nattitudes and how your personal history might affect your work. Try to view all of your clients as individuals \nworthy of your help and caring. \nPage updated 2019This page intentionally left blank FS  |  35\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSCross-Cultural Communication\nuch of the communication within the \nclinic is between people of different \ncultures. This page will discuss steps you \ncan take to bridge cultural differences when talking \nto clients and staff. \nSteps to Take\nThese are steps you can take to be prepared to communicate with staff and clients of different \ncultures.\nn B e aware of stereotypes and your prejudices \nabout other people and cultures. Read Cultural \nConsiderations on the previous page. \nn Use language suppor t resources, such as \ntranslating or interpreting services (see Resources in the Cross Cultural Communications and \nDealing with Language Barriers sections).\nn R ely on cultural experts. Identify people who are \nknowledgeable about the culture of your clients. \nAsk them to assist you with interpreting people\u2019s \nactions, as well as understanding the subcultures \nand varying behaviors in a population. Find out as much as you can about cultural rules for the \ngroups that come to the clinic for services.\nWhen talking with clients\nCPSP staff should keep these seven \nrecommendations in mind to communicate \neffectively with clients of varying cultures:\n1. B e aware of your own biases\n2. E valuate the client for language assistance needs\n3. Establish rappor t \n4. R espect different cultures\n5. C ollect information respectfully: \u201cTell me more\u201d\n6. L earn about and appreciate different \ncommunication styles\n7. F ind out the role of family1.  B e aware of your own biases\n Explor e stereotypes and prejudices about other \npeople and cultures you may harbor.\n2.  E valuate the client for language  \nassistance needs\n I f the client needs language assistance, provide \nan interpreter. See No Language in Common with \nStaff and Working with Interpreters. \n3.  E stablish rapport\n T ake a few minutes at the beginning of the visit \nfor \u201csmall talk.\u201d This will let the client get used to the setting and establishes common ground. \nSmall talk is an important part of communication \nin many cultures. A client may want to share her feelings about her long trip to the clinic, recent \nholiday celebrations, or her problems with her \nmother-in-law. Small talk establishes a connection and lets the client get ready for a more directed \ndiscussion. For example ask: \u201cHow are you feeling \ntoday?\u201d or \u201cHow has your week gone?\u201d\n4.  Resp ect different cultures\n Sho w respect. Be open and willing to understand \nother people\u2019s needs, health beliefs, and  health practices.\n Explain that Western or conventional medicine \nis just one kind of health care. Other health care models can be just as effective. Accept the client\u2019s \nhealth beliefs, attitudes, and health practices. \nSome of her health beliefs may be based on different cultural practices. \n Explain t ests and treatments in ways that make \nsense given the client\u2019s worldview.\n5.  C ollect information respectfully:  \n\u201cTell me more\u201d\n A client \u2019s cultural background may not be obvious. \nInvite her to talk about her culture, family situation, and about the people who give her advice. \n A sk the client about any alternative health \npractices, medicines, or herbs she may be taking. \nPage updated 2019 FS  |  36\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSCross-Cultural Communication\nThis information is important for her treatment \nplan. While some alterative health practices may \nbe positive, others could be dangerous. \n Using the phrase , \u201cTell me more \u2026\u201d is a respectful \nway to talk clients. It shows that you are open and \nwilling to understand more about the client. It \nhelps you collect important information for her \ntreatment plan. For example, you might say:\nn \u201c Tell me more about what you are doing to \nprepare for a healthy baby.\u201d\nn \u201c Tell me more about the herbal remedies you \nuse to ease your morning sickness.\u201d\nn \u201c Tell me more about what you might like to \ndo to relax during early labor.\u201d\n S ee Little Experience with Western Care in the \nPsychosocial section for more questions you can ask to find out about the client\u2019s beliefs and experiences. \n6.  L earn about and appreciate different \ncommunication styles\n Silence\n S ome people use silence to let an emotion pass, \nor to think about what to say next. Different cultures have different traditions for \u201cpause time.\u201d \nWatch the client to see how she uses silence. Do \nnot jump in to fill a silent pause with small talk.\n Non- verbal communication\n S ome kinds of touching, handshakes, eye contact, \nand hand or feet movements are impolite or offensive in certain cultures. Sometimes \ngender or age can influence the cultural rules. \nSome clients may smile or laugh to cover other emotions or to avoid conflict. \n T ake your clues from the client as to how close \nshe wants to sit, or whether or not she touches you or looks directly at you. \n \u201c Yes\u201d means\u2026\n S ome clients may reply \u201cyes\u201d even when they do \nnot necessarily understand or plan to do what is being discussed. In some cultures, it may be a way of offering respect. Be sensitive to cues that \ncommunication she has shut down. Encourage \na give-and-take discussion so the client\u2019s involvement and understanding is evident.\n7.  F ind out the role of family\n When appr opriate, involve family members in \nthe client\u2019s care (within HIPAA guidelines). HIPAA is the federal Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act of 1996. The primary goal of \nthe law is to make it easier for people to keep health insurance, protect the confidentiality and \nsecurity of healthcare information and help the \nhealthcare industry control administrative costs.\n L earn the patterns of decision making in the \nclient\u2019s family. In many cultures, family members are responsible for making decisions and giving \npermission for treatment, medication, and \nhospital stays. Family members can also provide information about the client\u2019s health practices, \nalternative medicine use, and can be essential to \nthe client\u2019s adherence to her treatment plan.\n I t may not always be culturally appropriate \nto include family members or friends in your discussions with the client, even if she has  \ngiven permission. Look for cues from the client and be sensitive to her non-verbal messages.  \nFor example, she may not want to share a Sexually \nTransmitted Infections (STI) test results with friends \nand family. In addition, family members, friends, or minors should not serve as an interpreter for a \nclient (see Guidelines for Using Interpreters).\nResources\nAddressing Language Access Issues in Y our \nPractice: A Toolkit for Physicians and Their  Staff Members\nhttps://innovations.ahrq.gov/qualitytools/addressing-\nlanguage-access-issues-your-practice-toolkit-\nphysicians-and-their-staff\nPage updated 2019 FS  |  37\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSDealing with Language Barriers\nIf a client has no language in common with the staff, \nyou need to provide an interpreter.Steps to Take \nPrepare your CPSP practice for many languages\nn A ssess all clients for language needs, including \nsign language (see the following section, Assess \nLanguage Differences).\nn I f the client needs language assistance, provide \na trained interpreter in the language most comfortable for her (see Guidelines for Using \nInterpreters on the following page).\nu M aintain a list of well-qualified language \ninterpreters. These may be face-to-face \ninterpreters or an outside telephone \ninterpretation service (see Resources). This list \nshould also include American Sign Language interpreters.\nn Identify and r ecord the client\u2019s primary language \nin her medical records.\nn K eep a log of staff language capabilities, \nincluding American Sign Language. In this log, indicate the trained language interpreters on \nstaff, the languages each staff person can speak, \nread, and/or write (see Resources for sample log). \nn Establish policies and guidelines f or serving \nas interpreters. If possible, have trainings or in-services on how to be an effective verbal \ninterpreter or translator of written materials.\nn P rovide easy-to-read and culturally appropriate \npamphlets in the client\u2019s language. English \npamphlets should contain pictures and graphics. A \nfriend or relative might be able to translate written \nEnglish material. If needed, use picture and phrase \nsheets to help communicate with the client.\nn I f you do not have a written handout in the \nclient\u2019s language, consider using health related \napplications (apps) for computers, tablets, and \nsmartphones. Apps are helpful if they show \nactions such as exercises, birth, caring for a baby, etc. Try using educational apps with the volume \noff, using an interpreter to explain the visuals. Assess language differences\nn P ay attention to how the client answers the \nassessment form question about the language \nshe prefers to use during her CPSP visits. Some \nclients will need an interpreter to respond to this \nquestion. Some clients will speak enough English to say they prefer a different language (such as \nsaying in English that they prefer Spanish).\nn I f the client prefers to receive her CPSP services \nin English, you will need to assess her level of \nEnglish literacy (see Low Literacy Skills).\nn Dur ing your language assessment remember to:\nu F ace the client directly\nu Speak slo wly\nu Speak sof tly (speaking loudly implies anger \nand may cause the client to fear you).\nu W atch the client\u2019s facial expressions and body \ngestures. These can help you determine the need for a language interpreter.\nn T o help identify the client\u2019s language, you can \nshow her an \u201cI Speak\u201d card and ask her to point to what language she speaks (see the \u201cI Speak\u201d \nlanguage identification card in Resources). \nn A client ma y speak English, but if she can\u2019t ask \nquestions, explain her needs, or describe what \nshe has learned, she may need an interpreter. \nn I f the client needs assistance, use an interpreter. \nSee Guidelines for Using Interpreters on the following page. You can use the following types \nof interpreter services:\nu F ace-to-face interpretation\nu O ver the phone interpretation\nu V ideo medical interpretation\nPage updated 2019 FS  |  38\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSDealing with Language Barriers\nFollow Up\nAfter your discussion or educational session, ask the \nclient if she still has the same language preference, \nor if she needs to change interpreters.

These may be face-to-face interpreters or telephone \ninterpretation vendors. \nn Identify and r ecord the client\u2019s primary language \non her medical records.\nn L earn basic words and phrases in other languages \nin order to greet clients and to follow what \ninterpreters are saying.\nn Expec t to spend more time with a client when \nusing an interpreter.\nChoosing an Interpreter \nn Ideally , the interpreter should be bicultural, \ntrained in cross-cultural interpretation, trained in the health care field, and able to understand \nperinatal terms.\nn T ry to use a female interpreter. \nn F amily members and minors are not appropriate \ninterpreters. The client may want a family member \nor friend to participate in a discussion or help \ninterpret, but confidentially may become an issue; \nfor example delivering STI test results or discussing abusive relationships. In addition, family and friends \nmay change an interpretation to \u201cprotect\u201d the \nclient from difficult topics or to present the client\u2019s information in a way that \u201clooks good\u201d for the family. \nn O ccasionally there may be problems with using \nan interpreter who is older or younger than the client, of a different social class or educational level, or from a particular region or country of origin. If more than one interpreter is available \nfor a particular language, find out the client\u2019s \npreferences on issues such as gender, age, country of origin, etc. \nSteps to Take \nWorking with All Interpreters\nn I f this is your first meeting with the client, \nintroduce yourself first to the client, then introduce yourself to the interpreter. Finally, \nintroduce the interpreter to the client. \nn A sk the interpreter to explain his or her role to the \nclient.\nn P osition yourself:\nu An int erpreter should be next to but a bit \nbehind the client. This gets the interpreter out \nof the line of sight. \nu Sig n language interpreters should be \npositioned next to you, so the client can see the sign language interpreter\u2019s hands.\nn Speak dir ectly to the client, not to the interpreter. \nLook at the client, not at the interpreter.\nn A sk the client to speak directly to you.\nn Speak in the first person t o the client. (Example: \n\u201cDo you have an upset stomach?\u201d)\nn Speak slo wly and at an even pace. Speak in short \nsentences. Pause often and let the interpreter interpret. \nn A sk one question at a time.\nn A void interrupting the interpretation.\nn I f you don\u2019t want it interpreted, don\u2019t say it.\nn I f you want to talk to the interpreter, first tell the \nclient that you will be talking to the interpreter.\nn Explain t echnical terms such as C-section, IV, \npreterm, etc.\nPage updated 2019 FS  |  46\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSGuidelines for Using Interpreters\nn I f the concept is complex, it may work better to \nexplain the whole thing to the interpreter and \nthen let her explain it to the client.\nn W atch the client for nonverbal cues, such as avoiding \neye contact, crossing arms, and looking down.\nn A sk the client questions such as, \u201cTell me about \u2026\u201d\nn R eview important points by saying, \u201cLet me tell \nyou what I have heard, to be sure I understand clearly \u2026\u201d\nn F requently check with the client using the \u201cteach \nback\u201d method to be sure she understands your main points. Ask the client to teach you/explain \nthe most important part of your message. \n(See Educating Effectively for a more detailed description of the teach back method.)\nWorking with an Untrained \nInterpreter \nThere may be times when you will not be able to \nobtain the services of a trained interpreter. This is \nnot ideal, but it may be the only way to talk with the \nclient. \nSpeak with the Untrained Interpreter\nFollow the guidelines for working with all interpreters \nand add these steps: \nn T ry to assess the interpreter\u2019s level of English \nlanguage skills and her ability to interpret.\nn A sk the interpreter to interpret everything you say.\nn I f the interpreter and the client get into a \nconversation, ask the interpreter to inform you of \nwhat was discussed.\nn I nterrupt the interpreter if you think the \ninterpreter is getting off the subject or not completing the interpretation.Working with a Telephone Interpreter\nWorking with a telephone interpreter is different than working with an interpreter in person. You don\u2019t have \ndirect contact with the interpreter and you may have \nto pass the phone back and forth between you and the client, unless you have a speakerphone. \nA telephone interpreter is a trained interpreter qualified \nto provide appropriate interpretation services. Telephone interpreters work off site and can be contracted by your \noffice or clinic to provide their services. Most services are \nopen 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \nMake a phone call \nn Dial the t oll free number provided by your office \nor clinic.\nn P rovide your agency\u2019s account number.\nn R equest the language you need.\nSpeak with the telephone interpreter\nFollow the guidelines for working with all interpreters, \nadding these steps: \nn F ace the client and talk directly to her. Ask the client \nto speak directly to you. Explain the reason for your \ncall to the client (the interpreter will interpret).\nn Explain that y ou will make a statement to the \nclient and then the interpreter will make a statement to the client.\nResources \u2013 See \u201cDealing with \nLanguage Barriers\u201d\nFor free or low-cost phone interpretation services, \nplease work with your local community-based \norganizations. FS  |  47\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSL ow Literacy Skills\nIn general people with reading skills below the  \nfifth grade level are considered \u201cfunctionally  \nilliterate\u201d and lack many skills to function effectively  \nin today\u2019s society.Background\nearning disabilities are not the same as \nlow literacy skills. Clients with learning \ndisabilities, such as dyslexia and slow-\nlearning, may benefit from many of the same \ntechniques described in this section. \nHow to Assess Low Literacy\nIf a client has very low literacy skills or is unable to read, note this information in the chart where all staff \nwill see it. Discuss her literacy skills during any case \nconferences, as it may affect how other services are provided. \nn A ssess literacy for all clients, no matter how much \nformal schooling they\u2019ve had. A person who finished 10th grade will likely read at a 4th grade \nlevel. The only way to know is to ask a person to \nread. People with low literacy skills may be rich or poor, born locally or in another country, a fast \nlearner, or a slow learner, etc.\nn A sk the client to read two or three sentences \nfrom Welcome to Pregnancy Care in the Health \nEducation section about danger signs of \npregnancy. Explain that this is to be sure she \nunderstands them. Ask her to say them, in her own words, or read from the list. \nn I f she reads without difficulty, continue on with \nthe orientation or assessment. Consider how she prefers to learn, her experiences and interests in \nusing written materials. \nn I f she reads slowly or with difficulty, ask her \nquestions about the content. If she cannot \ndiscuss the content easily and completely, use \nthe guidelines for low literacy. Explain that people \nlearn in different ways and she probably knows what works best for her. \nn Explain that when wr itten materials are offered, \nthey will illustrate the information and will not have many pages of reading. Invite her to give feedback on the materials that work well for her and are the most helpful.\nn I f she uses excuses such as \u201cwant to read it later\u201d \nor \u201ccan\u2019t see such small print,\u201d use the low-literacy guidelines. Explain, as above, that people learn in \ndifferent ways.\nn When w orking with a client in another  \nlanguage, use the same approach in assessing literacy. Also, consider regional variations of  \nthe same language.\nFollow Up\nWhen a client returns for follow-up visits, review any questions she may have about written materials given \nto her. It may be useful to review the written material \ntogether again. For critical topics such as danger signs or kick counts, conduct a complete review of the \nmaterial. Especially for women with low literacy or no \nliteracy skills, ask her explain her understanding and what she will do if danger signs occur.\nGuidelines for low literacy readers and  \nnon-readers\nn A sk about times when she was successful at \nlearning and enjoyed it.\nn C onsider referring her to group sessions where \nemphasis is on talking, visual aids, discussion and \ndemonstrations.\nn T each the smallest amount possible to do the job; \nonly give information that is necessary to get the point across.\nn I n one-on-one sessions, use demonstrations and \nvisual aids when possible.\nPage updated 2019 FS  |  48\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSL ow Literacy Skills\nn A sk the client to talk about the topic in her own \nwords to see if she understands.\nn R eview important points a number of times.\nn T ry to limit new ideas to three to four items at any \none time.\nn Help clients decr ease anxiety, which acts as a \nbarrier to learning.\nn R eward clients with encouragement at every \nopportunity.\nn F or any written material provided:\nu Explain the pur pose of the pamphlet\nu R eview the pamphlet with the client\nu Under line or highlight specific information on \nwhich she should focus\nu A sk her to explain or demonstrate the content \nto check her understanding of it\nn A sk if she has someone who helps her read \nwritten materials and how they can help with \nhealth education. Ask what kind of materials \nshe prefers, what language she would like the \nmaterials in, how much narrative or writing she would like in the materials, etc.\nn Encourage her t o speak up if she\u2019s asked to read \ninformation by other providers (such as WIC,  the lab) that she does not understand. Role-play \na brief conversation between the client and \nanother provider (such as a nurse). Have the  client practice letting people know she needs \nmore verbal explanations.\nn Use mat erials with only relevant, important \npoints. Use concrete examples as much as \npossible. Try to lower her anxiety and reward her \nwith encouragement as often as possible.\nn C onsider using audio tapes for important \ninformation, such as danger signs. These can be \nmade in a number of languages, if needed.n I f the woman asks about improving her reading \nskills, make referrals to local literacy classes.  Check the library, any community college or  \nadult school, or high schools for possible classes. \nSee Resources.\nChoosing easy to read materialsThe easiest materials to read contain the following:\nn C onversational style and active voice (such as \u201ctake \na prenatal vitamin every day\u201d as opposed to \u201cdaily supplements are recommended to ensure . . .\u201d)\nn Shor t and clear sentences\nn F ew medical terms or jargon\nn W ords that are two syllables or less\nn V ery little narrative\nn Lar ge type\nn Upper and lo wer case letters\nn Headings (subtitles) and \u201cchunk\u201d related \ninformation in small sections\nn F ollow a clear order\nn Simple line -drawing visuals for showing what the \nreader should do (not what she shouldn\u2019t). Do not show detached body parts.\nResources\nFor more information about educational materials for clients with low literacy, see:\nCalifornia Literacy Resources: http://www.literacynet.\norg/slrc/home.html\nCalifornia Literacy, Inc.: http://cahealthliteracy.org/\nhlrc_plainlan.html#iasd\nFor referrals for literacy classes or resources for clients \nsee the National Literacy Directory at:  \nhttps://www.nationalliteracydirectory.org/ FS  |  49\nSTEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSClients with Alternative  Health Care Experiences\nome clients have had little experience \nwith Western health care. They have never \nbeen to a clinic or hospital, and have \nalways used the services of traditional healers. These \nwomen may have a lot of experience and knowledge \nabout pregnancy, birth, and infant care. They may \nhave had babies at home with a midwife or they may have never been pregnant or given birth.\nWestern health care is based on diagnosing and \ntreating diseases, which are caused by germs and biochemical factors.\nOther beliefs about health may include factors such \nas supernatural forces, God\u2019s will, religion, imbalances, bad conduct, or eating certain foods. \nHow to Assess the Need\nAsk about the client\u2019s past use of Western health care services during the initial health education \nassessment. If she has little or no experience with \nthem, find out what beliefs and experiences she has had with other non-Western health care. Ask \nquestions like:\nn What k inds of things do you do when you get sick?\nn What did y our family do for you when you were \nlittle and got sick?\nn Ar e there healers in your community who help \nsick people? Are there women who help care for \nthe new mother and baby?\nn Ha ve you used their services?\nn Ha ve you been pregnant before or had a baby  \nat home?\nn Ha ve you seen a baby being born? What was the \nsetting like, who helped, how did the woman cope with birthing pains and recuperation?\nn Ar e there things that are harmful for women \nduring pregnancy or after birth that you want to avoid, such as foods, showers, certain activities or \nmovements?Steps to Take\nBased on the client\u2019s beliefs and past experiences, \ndetermine how you can help her understand Western \nhealth care services. Describe Western health care \nas one approach, not necessarily the only approach. Western health care services can be used in \nconjunction with many traditional approaches.\nFollow Up\nAt each visit ask if she has any questions about \nthe care she is receiving. This may be her only \nopportunity to learn about Western prenatal care.  \nThe more she learns the more fully she can participate. \nAsk postpartum clients what they wish they had \nknown about their hospital or clinic experiences ahead of time. They may have ideas for helping  \nfuture clients who have little experience with  \nWestern health care.\nPage updated 2019This page intentionally left blankSTEPS TO TAKEHealth EducationSTEPS TO TAKE\nHealth Education\nHealth EducationThis page intentionally left blankHE  |  3\nSTEPS TO TAKEHEALTH EDUCATIONT able of Contents\nIntroduction   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\nHealth Education Plan   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\nWhat to Discuss on the First Visit   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\nWelcome to Pregnancy Care   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .11\nHospital Orientation  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .15\nPreterm Labor   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .17\nIf Your Labor Starts Too Early   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .21\nPrevention of Repeat Preterm Birth: \nProgesterone Shots   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .23\nKick Counts   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .25\nCount Your Baby\u2019s Kicks   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .27\nSTIs (Sexually Transmitted Infections)   . . . . . . . . . . . .  .29\nWhat You Should Know About STDs   . . . . . . . . . .  .33\nHIV and Pregnancy   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .35\nWhat You Should Know About HIV   . . . . . . . . . . . .  .37\nYou Can Protect Yourself \n and Your Baby from STDs   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .39\nCautions While Pregnant   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .41\nImmunizations and Pregnancy   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .45\nYour Baby Needs to be Immunized   . . . . . . . . . . . .  .47\nPregnant?

It is also called premature \nlabor  .  If noticed in time, preterm labor can sometimes \nbe stopped with medications or medical procedures \nto prevent a preterm delivery  .\nIf preterm labor is not noticed in time, uterine \ncontractions can cause the cervix to open earlier \nthan normal, leading to preterm birth  . Preterm birth \ncan cause breathing, feeding, and temperature-\nregulating problems for the baby  .  Complications \nrelated to prematurity are the leading cause of death \nfor babies in the United States  .  Preventing preterm \nbirths should be a major focus of prenatal care  .\nSteps to Take\nFor all clients:\nAt or before the 20th week of pregnancy, discuss the warning signs of preterm labor and what the client \nshould do if she experiences any of them  .\nn Giv e the handout If Your Labor Starts Too Early\nn R eview each warning sign on the handout  .  Half of all women who go into preterm labor have \nnone of the identified risk factors. Every client should \nknow the warning signs, and what to do if she \nexperiences a warning sign.Who is at Risk?\nThings you can do to reduce your risk:\nn B egin prenatal care in the first trimester\nn C ome to prenatal appointments regularly\nn A void using tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs\nn Ea t a healthy balance of foods for appropriate \nweight gain\nWomen with a higher risk of premature birth have 1 \nor more of the following risk factors:\nn A hist ory of preterm birth in a previous pregnancy \n(highest risk for subsequent preterm birth)\nn P reterm labor, a serious infection (especially \nUTIs), or abdominal surgery during current pregnancy\nn T obacco, alcohol, or drug use during current \npregnancy\nn P regnancy with twins or other multiples\nn A bnormalities of the cervix or uterus, such as \nincompetent cervix, uterine malformations, or fibroids\nn Bleeding in the sec ond or third trimester of the \ncurrent pregnancy\nn Under weight or obese before pregnancy\nn D omestic violence or any abuse during \npregnancy\nn P lacenta previa (the placenta is in front of the cervix)\nn Diabetes\nn H igh blood pressure\nn T hrombophilias (health conditions that increase \nthe chances of making abnormal blood clots)\nHere\u2019s what you can do to reduce your risk for preterm labor and premature birth:\nn G et to a healthy weight before pregnancy \nand gain the right amount of weight during pregnancy. Talk to your provider about the  \nright amount of weight for you before and \nduring pregnancy.\nPage updated 2019HE  |  18\nSTEPS TO TAKEHEALTH EDUCATIONPreterm Labor\nSometimes the signs of preterm labor may be \nvery mild and hard to detect  .

Contractions may also feel like very \nbad menstrual cramps  .\nn Emphasiz e that the client should watch for any of \nthe warning signs, and call if any warning signs \noccur (watch and call)  . Be sure she knows what \nnumber to call on weekdays, and on nights and \nweekends  .\nn R ehearse who she will call, where she will go, and \nhow she will get there if she has warning signs of preterm labor\nn Explain that if she exper iences preterm labor \nwarning signs she must be examined by a health care provider, who will feel the cervix to see if it \nis changing  .  Because contractions may not affect \nthe cervix one day, but can cause dilation the next, she must be checked each time she has \nwarning signs  .\nn Emphasiz e the importance of calling  .\n S ome clients hesitate to call their health care \nproviders  .  Some women want to see if the \nsymptoms will go away on their own  . Others may \nfeel that the symptoms are too mild to \u201cmake a fuss\u201d over or that they are too busy to lie down for an \nhour to evaluate the signs  .  Others may want to try \ntheir own remedies in the comfort of their homes  . \nContractions can also be an early sign of infection, \nsuch as urinary  .  It is important to see their provider \nto be sure there is not underlying infection  .\nn A sk your client if she has any hesitation about \nPage updated 2019n D on\u2019t smoke, drink alcohol use street drugs or \nabuse prescription drugs.

Depression is a medical \ncondition in which strong feelings of sadness \nlast for a long time and interfere with your daily life. It needs treatment to get better. The thyroid is a gland in your neck that makes \nhormones that help your body store and use \nenergy from food. \nn P rotect yourself from infections. Talk to your \nprovider about vaccinations that can help protect you from certain infections. Wash your \nhands with soap and water after using the \nbathroom or blowing your nose. Don\u2019t eat raw meat, fish or eggs. Have safe sex. Don\u2019t touch cat poop. \nn R educe your stress. Eat healthy foods and do \nsomething active every day. Ask family and friends for help around the house or taking \ncare of other children. Get help if your partner \nabuses you. Talk to your boss about how to lower your stress at work. \nn W ait at least 18 months between giving \nbirth and getting pregnant again. Use birth control until you\u2019re ready to get pregnant \nagain. If you\u2019re older than 35 or you\u2019ve had a \nmiscarriage or stillbirth, talk to your provider about how long to wait between pregnancies. \nMarch of Dimes: Preterm Labor and Premature Birth: Are you at Risk: https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/preterm-labor-and-premature-birth-are-you-at-risk.aspxHE  |  19\nSTEPS TO TAKEHEALTH EDUCATIONcalling  .

(These contractions occur 5 times or \nmore in an hour, and do not go away after about an \nhour of rest)  .\nHowever, there are other contractions called Braxton Hicks contractions, which are not warning signs of \npreterm labor  .  Braxton Hicks contractions commonly \noccur during the last part of pregnancy  .  Unlike the \ncontractions that are a warning sign of preterm labor, Braxton Hicks contractions usually go away after \nabout an hour of rest  . \nAsk your medical provider for guidance on when to \nexplain Braxton Hicks in your practice  .

The purpose is to prevent HIV \ntransmission to the baby by using drugs during and \nafter delivery for the woman and baby  .\nThere is no cure for HIV, but women can take anti-retroviral drugs to prolong their lives and maintain their \nhealth  . These drugs can reduce the chance that HIV \nwill be transmitted to the unborn baby to about 1% if a woman follows her treatment during pregnancy, during \nlabor, and after birth  . These drugs can also reduce ithe \nchance that HIV will be transmitted to her sexual partners  .\nMost often, the virus is spread when people have sex \nor share needles with someone who has HIV  .\nThere are 2 main ways to prevent HIV transmission: (1) use condoms every time during sex (penis, vagina, mouth, \nand anus), (2) don\u2019t share needles needles, and (3) take \npre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis medication  .\nSteps to Take\nFor all clients:\nFind out what the patient knows or has heard/\nexperienced about HIV or AIDS  .

In a pregnant woman, the \nparasite can cause an infection in the baby  .  Contagion \ncan occur at any time during the pregnancy, but \nit can be most harmful in the early months  .  Some \nbabies born with a toxoplasmosis infection will have medical conditions affecting the brain, eyes, \nheart, and other organs  .  About 20% of women with \ntoxoplasmosis infection during pregnancy transmit \nthe infection to their unborn babies  .  Most women \nhave no symptoms of toxoplasmosis infection, but if infection is suspected, a blood test can be used to \ndetect its presence  .  If a client wants to get tested, she \nshould ask her health care provider  .  Women can also \nbe tested to see if they\u2019ve already had toxoplasmosis \ninfection earlier in life  .\nListeriosis\nSoft cheese, raw milk, or raw or undercooked meat \ncan contain bacteria that causes listeriosis  .  Hot dogs, \ncold cuts, deli meat, p\u00e2t\u00e9, and smoked seafood can \nalso carry the bacteria  . If a pregnant woman is infected, \nshe may have a fever, sore throat, and pain  . A blood \ntest can show if she is infected  .  She could pass the \nillness on to her unborn baby through her blood  .  This \ninfection can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or serious \nillness in newborns  .  See the Food Safety Guidelines in \nthe \u201cNutrition\u201d section  . Avoid soft cheeses, like queso \nfresco, brie, or feta unless the labels show they are \npasteurized  .  Hard cheeses, solid at room temperature, \nare considered safe  .  Hot dogs, luncheon meats, and \ndeli meats must be reheated until steaming hot  . Mercury\nThe mercury content in fish is generally low  .  However, \nif a pregnant woman eats a diet high in fish, she \nmay eat enough mercury to harm her unborn baby  . \nPregnant and breastfeeding women should not eat shark, king mackerel, tilefish, or swordfish due to high \nmercury levels  .  A pregnant woman should eat 2-3 \nservings of fish a week in 2 to 3 meals  .  See Food Safety \nGuidelines for more information on fish safety and \nreview the \u201cNutrition\u201d handout, Lower Your Chances of \nEating Foods with Unsafe Chemicals in Them  .\nHigh Body Temperature\nStudies have shown that body temperature at 101\u00b0F \nor above can cause birth defects  .  Pregnant women \nshould not use hot tubs or saunas for more than 10 \nminutes, especially in the first trimester  .  In case of a \nfever, she should contact her health care provider \nright away  .  She should also avoid exercising heavily \nfor long periods of time, especially in hot weather or \nduring a fever  .\nDouches\nDouching is not necessary for normal hygiene and \ncan cause problems  .  Having more vaginal secretions \nduring pregnancy is normal and does not mean that \na woman needs to douche  .  Some pregnant women \nlike to wash more often with a washcloth and water  .  \nThis is not harmful  .  \nX-rays\nX-rays during pregnancy can expose the unborn baby to harmful levels of radiation, causing possible \nbirth defects or childhood leukemia  . If x-rays are \nneeded, the client must be sure to tell her dentist or health care provider that she is pregnant, to limit the \nunborn baby\u2019 exposure to x-rays  .  Walking through \ncheckpoints at airports does not pose a health risk  .HE  |  43\nSTEPS TO TAKEHEALTH EDUCATIONCautions While Pregnant\nChemicals\nExposure to chemicals can cause problems for the \nunborn baby, including birth defects, low birth \nweight, etc  .  Pregnant women should try to minimize \ntheir exposure to chemicals  .  They should get plenty \nof fresh air when around chemicals such as aerosol sprays, cleaning fluids, oven cleaners, paint, paint \nthinner, paint removers, glue, antifreeze, varnish, \nand flea bombs  .  Pregnant women can help prevent \nchemicals from entering their bodies by wearing \nprotective clothes or gloves to cover their skin, and \nnot eating or drinking around chemicals  .  \n This page intentionally left blankHE  |  45 STEPS TO TAKEHEALTH EDUCATION\nImmunizations and Pregnancy\nImmunizations Are Not Just for \nInfants-They Are for the Entire \nFamily! \nIdeally, all women of child-bearing age should be \nup-to-date on their immunizations before they \nbecome pregnant  . Prenatal care providers should \nassess immunization status at the first prenatal \nvisit . Although some vaccines, particularly live virus \nvaccines, are not recommended during pregnancy, certain immunizations are specifically indicated during \npregnancy  .  In addition, all routine immunizations may \nbe given to a mother while breastfeeding  .\nInfluenza (Flu)\nFlu is more likely to cause severe illness in pregnant \nwomen than in women who are not pregnant  . Changes \nin the immune system, heart and lungs during pregnancy make pregnant women more prone to developing \nsevere illness from flu, which can lead to hospitalization \nor even death  . Therefore, it is important that they receive \nthe influenza vaccine if they are pregnant or planning to \nbecome pregnant during the influenza season  . Influenza \nduring pregnancy can also affect the fetus and cause low \nbirth weight, premature birth and stillbirth  . \nWomen who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy \nshould receive the influenza vaccine as soon as it is \navailable each fall  .  Millions of pregnant women have \nsafely received flu shots over many years  .  Flu shots do \nnot affect babies\u2019 growth or development  . The shot is \nsafe to get during any trimester  .  \nInfants are also at increased risk of severe influenza and hospitalization from flu but cannot be immunized \nuntil they are at least 6 months of age  .  Fortunately, \nwhen the mother gets flu vaccine during pregnancy, \nshe passes protective flu antibodies to her baby  .  This \nhelps protect her baby from flu for several months  .  An \nadditional way to protect infants after birth is for all of their caregivers and close contacts (including brothers \nand sisters, grandparents and babysitters) to get \nvaccinated against the flu  .  Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis \n(Tdap)\nPertussis (whooping cough) is a very serious disease \nthat can cause babies to turn blue, stop breathing, \nand die  .  To protect infants who are too young to \nbe vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that pregnant women \nreceive a dose of Tdap at the earliest opportunity \nduring the third trimester of each pregnancy, regardless of the patient\u2019s prior history of receiving \nTdap (or Td)  . \nTdap vaccine not only helps protect the mother from getting and spreading pertussis to her baby \nafter birth, but also provides the baby with direct \nprotection against pertussis because the mother\u2019s protective antibodies from the vaccine are passed to \nthe baby during pregnancy  .  Vaccinating patients with \nTdap during the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy, rather than postpartum, will prevent more \ninfant hospitalizations and deaths from pertussis  .  To \nprovide the best protection for the baby, Tdap should be given as early as possible between weeks 27 and \n36 of pregnancy  .  The level of pertussis antibodies \ndecreases over time, so Tdap should be given during every pregnancy in order to transfer the greatest \nnumber of protective antibodies to each baby  .  \nRubella\nAll women of child-bearing age should be protected against rubella with at least 1 dose of the measles, \nmumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine  .  Rubella infection \nduring pregnancy can cause miscarriage or a pattern of birth defects such as deafness and mental \nretardation (congenital rubella syndrome)  . Physicians \nproviding prenatal care should check for immunity \nto rubella through a blood test  . Women who are not \nimmune to rubella should be immunized with MMR vaccine shortly after delivery and before discharge \nfrom the health care facility  .\nPage updated 2019Chicken Pox\nAll women of child-bearing age should be immune to \nchickenpox, either by having the disease or through 2 \ndoses of the varicella vaccine  .  This vaccine is a live virus \nvaccine, so it should not be given during pregnancy  .  If it \nis determined during pregnancy that the woman is not yet protected against chickenpox, she should receive \nthe vaccine shortly after delivery and before discharge \nfrom the healthcare facility  .  The second dose should be \nadministered 4-8 weeks after the first dose  .\nHepatitis B\nPrenatal care providers are required by California law \nto test pregnant women for hepatitis B infection  . \nUninfected pregnant women who have clinical \nhepatitis or report risk factors for hepatitis B infection \nshould be re-tested before delivery  .  Risk factors \ninclude recent intravenous drug use, an HBV infected sex partner, more than one sex partner in the past 6 \nmonths, or recent treatment for an STD  .  Finally, if a \npregnant woman does not have documentation of her hepatitis B status at the time of delivery, the birth \nhospital should test the woman and provide post-\nexposure prophylaxis to the infant if the mother is \ndetermined to be HBsAq positive  .\nHepatitis B infected women should also be tested for HBV DNA (viral load) and referred to a specialist if \nHBV DNA \u226520,000 IU/mL  . These women may benefit \nfrom antiviral treatment during pregnancy to prevent \ntransmission of hepatitis B to the infant  .\nAll infants born to mothers known to be infected with hepatitis B should receive both hepatitis B \nvaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin within \n12 hours of birth  . These infants should also \ncomplete the hepatitis B vaccine series according \nto the recommended schedule and receive post-\nvaccination serologic testing, ideally between 9-12 \nmonths of age, to ensure that they are not infected and are immune and will not pose an ongoing risk of \nhousehold transmission of hepatitis B  .\nFor more information and resources, see:  https://www  . cdph  . ca  . gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/\nPages/Immunization/Pregnancy  . aspx\nHE  |  46 STEPS TO TAKEHEALTH EDUCATION\nImmunizations and Pregnancy\nPage updated 2019STEPS TO TAKEHE  |  47Health Education HandoutY our Baby Needs to be Immunized\nShots can protect your baby from dangerous \nchildhood diseases. \nYour baby could get very sick or even die from these \ndiseases  .

Two specific types of mosquitos \ncan spread the Zika virus, and both types are found \nin certain areas of California  . Zika is also sexually \ntransmitted, and since most people with Zika don\u2019t have symptoms, they can spread the virus to their \nsexual partners without knowing it  . The greatest risk \nfrom Zika is to a pregnant woman\u2019s developing baby  .  \nIf a pregnant woman gets Zika, by being bitten by an infected mosquito or by having unprotected sex with \nsomeone who has the virus, she can pass the virus to \nher developing baby, which can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, severe birth defects, and possible \nneurodevelopmental and other abnormalities after \nbirth  . There is no vaccine or medicine to treat Zika  . \nSteps to Take\nAdvise All Pregnant Clients: \nn D on\u2019t go to areas where there is an outbreak of \nZika  . (See outbreak areas shown in red on the \nCDC World Zika Map  . )\nn B efore visiting any place where Zika has been \nreported, including Mexico, talk to your health \ncare provider to discuss the potential risks to your \npregnancy  .  Consider where you are traveling, \nyour ability to protect yourself from mosquito bites, and if your sexual partner is also traveling \nto an area with Zika  . If you decide to travel, \nprotect yourself from mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika:\nu P revent mosquito bites by using EPA-\nregistered insect repellent, which is safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women when \nused as directed  .  \nu P ractice safer sex during travel and for the \nrest of your pregnancy: use condoms (male or female) and dental dams from start to finish, every time, during all types of sex \n(vaginal, anal, and oral) OR do not have sex \nfor the rest of your pregnancy  .  Both male and \nfemale sexual partners can transmit Zika to a \npregnant woman  . If only your sexual partner \ntravels to an area with Zika, still use condoms \nor do not have sex for the rest of your \npregnancy  .  \nShare the CDPH Zika + Pregnancy Poster with your clients, which can serve as a take-home tool and \nprovide additional information about preventing \nmosquito bites  .\nSexual Transmission Prevention for \nClients Planning Pregnancy\nn  C ouples who are trying to become pregnant \nshould consider delaying pregnancy if they travel \nto or live in an area with Zika  . \nn I f a male partner goes to an area with Zika: delay \npregnancy and practice safer sex \u2013 or do not have \nsex \u2013 for at least 3 months after returning from an \narea with Zika  .\nn I f a female goes to an area with Zika: delay \npregnancy and practice safer sex \u2013 or do not have sex \u2013 for at least 2 months after returning from an \narea with Zika  .\nn I f a male and female travel together to an area \nwith Zika: delay pregnancy and practice safer sex \u2013 or do not have sex \u2013 for at least 3 months after \nreturning from an area with Zika  .\nFollow Up & Referrals\nRefer to a health care provider according to your protocols: \nn I f your client has been to an area with Zika or had \nsex with someone who has been to an area with \nZika  .\nPage updated 2019HE  |  54 STEPS TO TAKEHEALTH EDUCATION\nDiscuss the following with your client:\nAsk your client about possible Zika exposure and \nsymptoms  .

It\u2019s when a woman has high blood \npressure and signs that some of her organs, like her \nkidneys and liver, may not be working normally  .  \nPreeclampsia is a serious health problem for \npregnant women  . It affects two to eight percent of \npregnancies  .  In the United States, it\u2019s the cause of \n15 percent of premature births and up to 16% of \nmaternal deaths  .\nIt is important that all pregnant women are \nscreened to determine if they are at risk for \ndeveloping preeclampsia  . If they are at risk, taking \nlow dose aspirin (81mg) every day can reduce their \nrisk by 20-30 percent  . Women need to be reassured \nthat taking an aspirin to prevent preeclampsia is safe \nfor them and their baby  .  Low Dose Aspirin can be \nprescribed for the patient like any other medication  . \nClinical Risk Assessment for Preeclampsia: Women with 1 or more high-risk factors should receive low-\ndose aspirin  .

Oxytocin (sometimes called \nPitocin) is the most common drug used to induce \nlabor  .  There are other ways labor may be induced \nwithout the use of drugs  .\nGoal\nHelp your client:\nn Understand what labor induc tion is\nn D efine elective induction\nn D escribe steps to take if she is faced with the \npossibility of being induced before or after 39 \nweeks of pregnancy\nBackground\nThe rate of labor induction in the United States more \nthan doubled since 1990 from 9  .5% to 23  .1% in 20081 .\nLabor induction occurs when the doctor uses medications or other methods to start contractions \nbefore labor begins on its own  . This may be done for \nmedical reasons or for convenience  .  Inducing labor for \nreasons of convenience is called elective induction  . \nPreviously, many labor inductions were performed before 39 weeks gestation electively, for non-medical \nreasons, despite long-standing recommendations \nagainst this by health experts  .  Babies born before \n39 weeks are more likely to suffer from symptoms of \nprematurity and require admission to a special care \nnursery or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)  . There \nis also evidence showing that elective labor induction increases the risk of C-section births for women who \nare in labor for the first time  .\nElective labor induction has little to no benefit to a \npregnant woman and her baby  .  The medications used \nto induce labor increase the chance that both mother and baby will have complications during the birthing \nprocess  .  These complications may include the following:n T he pregnant woman may have very strong \ncontractions during labor\nn T he unborn baby may have an abnormal heart \nrate\nn T he woman may be more likely to have a \nC-section if her labor fails\nn T he mother and baby may have to stay in the \nhospital longer\nn L onger hospital stays increase health care costs\nn T he mother and baby may become ill or even die\nSteps to Take\nFor all clients:\nn R eview the patient handout, What You Need to \nKnow about Labor Induction\nn P oint out the questions on the handout and \ntell the client that if her health care provider recommends labor induction, she should ask \nthese questions\nn R emind the client that she should not choose an \nelective induction because of pressure from her \nhealth care provider\nFor clients whose health care \nprovider recommends labor \ninduction:\nn R eview the questions on the handout, What You \nNeed to Know about Labor Induction\nn R emind the client that she should not choose an \nelective induction because of pressure from her \nhealth care provider\n1 US Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States, 2012HE  |  64\nSTEPS TO TAKEHEALTH EDUCATIONLabor Induction\nn Help a client whose labor will be induced f or \nmedical reasons to prepare for the possibility of a \ncomplication  .

Because it can be hard to know the date you \nbecame pregnant, inducing labor may mean that \nyour baby is born too early  .  Babies that are born too \nearly may have breathing problems and need extra \ncare  .  When inducing labor does not work, you may \nneed to have a C-section  .\nIf your doctor suggests that you be induced, ask these questions:\nn Wh y do I need to have my labor induced? \nn What ar e the possible risks to me and my baby if \nmy labor is induced?\nn C an I wait to have the baby naturally without \nbeing induced?\nn Ar e there any other options?HE  |  66\nEducaci\u00f3n Sobre La Salud Folleto\nPASOS A SEGUIRLo que Necesita Saber Sobre  \nla Inducci\u00f3n del Parto\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 es la Inducci\u00f3n del Parto?\nLa inducci\u00f3n del parto ocurre cuando a una mujer \nembarazada le dan medicamentos o emplean otros m\u00e9todos para iniciar su parto antes de que pase \nnaturalmente  .\nSu m\u00e9dico puede decidir inducirle el parto por algunas de las siguientes razones:\nn E l embarazo ha durado m\u00e1s de 42 semanas\nn T iene la presi\u00f3n arterial elevada\nn S e le rompe la fuente antes de tiempo\nn No tiene suficient e l\u00edquido alrededor de su beb\u00e9\nn E l beb\u00e9 no est\u00e1 creciendo bien\nn T iene problemas de salud, como la diabetes, que \npuede da\u00f1arla a usted o a su beb\u00e9\nAlgunas mujeres piden que sus m\u00e9dicos les induzcan el parto por motivos que no son m\u00e9dicos, por ejemplo:\nn P ara tener al beb\u00e9 temprano porque est\u00e1 \ncansada de estar embarazada\nn P ara tener al beb\u00e9 cuando est\u00e1n sus familiares y \namigos presentes\nn P ara coordinar el nacimiento del beb\u00e9 con sus \nd\u00edas de trabajo\nn P ara tener al beb\u00e9 temprano para que su m\u00e9dico \npueda estar en el partoNo es una buena idea inducir el parto si no hay problemas con el embarazo.La inducci\u00f3n del parto puede afectar la salud de \nsu beb\u00e9  .

Some rights apply to both parents  .  \nSee below for more information, or give your client a copy of \u201cPregnancy + My Job. \u201d\nChanges to the Client\u2019s Work\nPregnancy Accommodations under the Fair \nEmployment and Housing Act  (for pregnant and postpartum workers)\nPregnant employees who work for an employer with \n5+ employees have the right to request changes \nto their work that are advised by their healthcare \nprovider  .  The employee should talk with their \nhealthcare provider about their specific struggles \nat work to identify what changes the client needs  .  \nTo request changes, the client should provide their employer with a note from their healthcare provider \nrecommending the needed changes  .  A healthcare \nprovider can use \u201cNote 1\u201d below to certify the client\u2019s \nneed for accommodations at work  .\nBy helping the client to obtain needed changes on the job, you can assist the client to keep working \nlonger before starting leave, making it more likely \nthat the client will have sufficient job-protected leave to allow her to return to work after recovering from \nchildbirth  .\nJob Protected Leave\nPregnancy Disability Leave  \n(for pregnant and postpartum workers) (PDL)\nPregnancy Disability Leave provides pregnant \nworkers who have an employer with 5+ employees \nwith up to 4 months of job-protected time off from work while they are unable to work due to their \nhealth  . A healthcare provider needs to certify the \nleave  .  The client should provide their employer a \nnote from their healthcare provider saying what time period the client will be disabled from working because of pregnancy and childbirth  . PDL can be \ntaken intermittently (for example, clients may take time off in the first trimester for severe morning \nsickness, return to work, and then take additional \ntime off before their due date)  . A healthcare provider \ncan use \u201cNote 2\u201d below to certify the need for PDL  . A \nclient can use \u201cNote 3\u201d to inform their employer that \nthey intend to take PDL and baby bonding leave, as \ndescribed under number \u201c2\u201d below  .  If possible, the \nclient should notify their employer that they want to \ntake leave at least 30 days beforehand  .\nJob Protected Bonding Leave under the \nCalifornia Family Rights Act or New Parent Leave Act (for new parents)\nThe New Parent Leave Act and the California Family \nRights Act provide new parents with 12 weeks of job-\nprotected leave to spend bonding with their baby  .  To \nqualify, the employee must 1) work for an employer \nwith 20+ employees within 75 miles; 2) have worked \nfor their employer for at least 1 year; and 3) have \nworked over 1250 hours (about 25 hours per week) \nduring the 12 months before they start their leave  .  \nFor the parent who gives birth, bonding leave begins after the parent has recovered from childbirth related \nhealth conditions and is capable of returning to work, \nor after the 4 months of PDL have been used up, \nwhichever occurs first  . \nWhile a healthcare provider certification is not needed, the client should provide their employer \nwith at least 30 days\u2019 notice of their intent to take \nleave  .  Bonding leave can be taken all at once, or \nintermittently, with certain limitations  .  A client can \nuse \u201cNote 3\u201d to tell their employer that they want to \ntake bonding leave  .  HE  |  76\nSTEPS TO TAKEHEALTH EDUCATIONWage-Replacement During Leave\nDisability Insurance (DI)  \n(for the parent giving birth)\nDI provides partial wage-replacement benefits for employees who are unable to perform their regular job \nduties due to illness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth  . To \nbe eligible, a client must have paid into State Disability Insurance (SDI) during their base period (approximately \n5-18 months before the disability claim start date)  . SDI \ndeductions are typically marked on a client\u2019s paystub as \n\u201cCASDI  .\u201d  Citizenship is not required for eligibility  .\nThe client should apply by mail using the Claim for Disability Insurance (DI) Benefits, DE 2501 paper form or \nelectronically using SDI Online at edd  . ca  . gov/SDI Online \nfor faster processing  .  The DI application should be \nsubmitted after the client has begun their leave, but no \nlater than 49 days after their disability begins  .  A healthcare \nprovider will need to certify that they are unable to work due to their disability, using either the DE 2501 paper \nform or electronically using the EDD\u2019s online system, \nSDI Online  .  For a normal pregnancy, a client can receive \nDI for up to 4 weeks before the due date and up to 6 \nweeks after the birth for vaginal delivery, or 8 weeks for a \ncaesarian section  . DI provides approximately 60% to 70% \nof the client\u2019s past income  .  DI is typically received in the \nsame period that a client may qualify for job-protected \nleave under PDL, as described above  . \nPaid Family Leave (PFL) (for both parents)PFL provides up to 6 weeks of partial wage-replacement \nbenefits for employees who are unable to work for the \npurpose of bonding with a new child (either by birth, adoption, or foster care placement) or to care for a \nseriously ill family member (child, parent, parent-in-law, \ngrandparent, grandchild, sibiling, spouse, or registered \ndomestic partner)  . Leave can either be taken all at once \nor split over a 12-month period  .  Bonding leave must be \ntaken within 12 months of the child entering the family  . \nTo be eligible, a client must have paid into SDI during their base period or approximately 5-18 months before \ntheir family leave start date  .

Make every effort to refer these pregnant \nwomen to a dentist for a regular dental check-up and teeth cleaning. Goals\nHelp your client:\nn Understand and identify oral health pr oblems \ncommon to pregnant women\nn Understand the possible r elation between oral \ndisease, such as periodontal or gum infection, and \nhaving a preterm and/or low birth weight baby\nn Understand that dental car ies (tooth decay) is a \ntransmissible infectious disease and realize that she can lower the chances of transmitting the \nbacteria that cause dental caries to her baby\nn L earn how to prevent dental and gum diseases\nBackground\nPregnancy is an especially important time for women \nto take care of their oral health  . Pregnancy provides \na \u201cteachable moment\u201d and may be the only time \nsome women are eligible for dental benefits  .  Dental \ncaries is the single most common chronic disease \nof childhood, and its prevalence can persist as \nindividuals mature, including in pregnant women  . \nPregnancy can also contribute to certain conditions \nthat may result in the need for dental care  .  Women \nshould be aware of the following oral conditions during pregnancy: \nn T ooth decay (caries)\nn Gum disease (g ingivitis)\nn L oose teeth (tooth mobility)\nn Dr y mouth (xerostomia)\nn T oo much spit (excessive salivation)\nn L oss of tooth surface (acid erosion of teeth)\nImportant information about dental \ncaries (tooth decay):\nDental caries is the most common oral health \nproblem and is caused by specific bacteria  . Infants \nare not born with these bacteria  . Mothers with active tooth decay will have more decay-causing bacteria \nin their mouths than mothers with no tooth decay  .  \nMost infants get these bacteria from their mothers \nbefore their third birthday and are more likely to get \ncavities before the age of five  .  Therefore, a pregnant \nwoman can reduce her child\u2019s risk of developing early tooth decay by improving and maintaining her own \noral health as soon as possible  .\nGingivitis (gum disease)Gingivitis is a disease caused by bacteria and defined \nas inflammation of the gingiva (gums) causing \nredness, swelling, and bleeding  .  This is one of the \nmost common oral health problems seen during \npregnancy  .  Its prevalence has been reported to \nrange from 50% to 70% of all pregnant women  . \nDaily dental home care is the removal of plaque by \nbrushing and flossing  .  Poor daily dental home care is \ndirectly linked to gingivitis  .  Plaque is a sticky colorless \nfilm that accumulates on the teeth and gums every \nday . Plaque harbors bacteria that causes gingivitis, \nallowing the bacteria a shelter and place to multiply \ncausing infection  . Effective daily plaque removal \nprevents gingivitis  .  Hormonal changes that happen \nduring pregnancy can make the gingivitis worse  .  \nIf untreated, gingivitis may lead to periodontitis, \na more serious chronic infection of the gums, \nligaments, and bone supporting the teeth  . Advanced \nperiodontitis will cause tooth mobility, leading to tooth \nloss . Periodontitis may also contribute to preterm and/\nor low birth weight deliveries as well as cardiovascular \ndisease, stroke, and other medical conditions  .  Diabetic \npatients with periodontitis may have a difficult time \ncontrolling their blood glucose levels  .  Poorly controlled \ndiabetes before and during pregnancy can cause birth \ndefects, miscarriage, or other complications  .\nPage updated 2019HE  |  82\nSTEPS TO TAKEHEALTH EDUCATIONOral Health During Pregnancy\nRefer a pregnant woman for a dental visit if she has \nnot been to a dentist in the past 6 months or if she \nhas signs or symptoms of oral disease.Here are typical signs of gingivitis  .  The gums:\nn Ha ve a bright red color\nn Ar e swollen\nn Bleed easily when brushing and flossing\nn Ha ve a smooth and shiny surface\nn M ay be sensitive or tender\nAdvise your clients to do the following to prevent \ngingivitis: \nn Use a sof t toothbrush \nn F loss every day  .  Be sure to floss below the gum \nline, not just between the teeth  .\nn F ollow prenatal nutrition guidelines to eat a \nhealthy diet  .

Recent research \nhas proven that use by mothers is not effective in \npreventing cavities in their babies\u2019 teeth  . However, a \nwoman\u2019s own teeth will benefit from systemic and \ntopical fluoride  .\nSystemic fluoride is fluoride that is swallowed by the \nindividual, although any form of fluoride that bathes \nthe teeth for any period of time also has topical effects  . \nExamples of systemic fluoride are: \nn F luoridated water \nn Dietar y fluoride supplements \nu Tablets \nu Lozenges \nu V itamin-fluoride preparations \nu Liquids and dr ops \nn F luoridated salt (not available in the U  . S  . )\nn An y other source of fluoride that is swallowed \n(e .g ., many foods naturally have fluoride or are \nprocessed with fluoridated water)\nTopical fluorides applied to the enamel surfaces of \nteeth to prevent decay cause an exchange of chemical \ncompounds, remineralizing the tooth surface and \nmaking it less likely or more resistant to decay  .  Topical \nfluorides are not intended to be swallowed  . \nExamples of topical fluoride are: \nn Toothpaste\nn M outh rinse\nn F luoride gel, which is typically placed in a tray \nthat is held in the mouth for several minutes\nn F luoride varnishes, a gel which is painted on the \nteeth\nOral Condition Associated with Low Birth WeightWhen it occurs during pregnancy, a severe type \nof periodontal disease called periodontitis has \nbeen associated with preterm and/or low birth weight deliveries  .  Periodontitis is a severe, chronic \ninflammatory condition of the gingiva (gums) characterized by loss of attachment of the periodontal \nligament and bony support of the tooth  . Periodontitis \nis a more severe stage of gingivitis  .\nSeveral studies have suggested that untreated periodontal disease in a pregnant woman may lead to an increased \nrisk of delivering a premature and/or low birth weight \nbaby.\n Other studies have not confirmed this risk  . \nResearchers theorize about the association between \npremature births and periodontal infection  . One \nhypothesis is that periodontal infection can release \nbacteria and bacteria-produced toxins into the blood  . \nThese toxins may interfere with fetal development  . \nAnother theory is that periodontal infection causes an inflammatory reaction in the gums leading to a \nproduction of chemical mediators  .  These inflammatory \nmediators, produced by the mother\u2019s own immune system, may stimulate early cervical dilation and \nuterine contractions  .  Further research continues  . \nSome studies have suggested that untreated periodontal infection in a pregnant woman may lead \nto an increased risk of delivering a preterms and/or low \nbirth weight baby  .\nDental Caries and the Risk of Passing of Bacteria \nfrom Caretaker to Infants and Toddlers\nA growing body of scientific evidence suggests \nthat dental caries (tooth decay) is an infectious and \ntransmissible disease  .  The primary decay-causing \nbacterium in a mouth is Streptococcus mutans  .  The \ncaries process usually begins with bacteria in saliva \npassing from the caretaker to the child after birth  . Advise the pregnant women that prevention, \ndiagnosis, and treatment of tooth decay and gum \ndisease (including dental X-rays and use of local \nanesthesia) are highly beneficial and can be done any time during pregnancy with no additional harm to her or her baby, as compared to risks associated with \nnot getting care.\nPage updated 2019HE  |  85\nSTEPS TO TAKEHEALTH EDUCATIONOral Health During Pregnancy\nA mother who has untreated dental caries appears \nto be the most likely person to pass the bacteria \nfrom her saliva to her child\u2019s mouth  . Dental disease-\ncausing bacteria can also be transmitted to a child from the father, other family members, and other \ncaretakers with similar behaviors  .  \nHere are some ways the mother may lower the chances of passing oral bacteria to her child:\nn A void sharing the child\u2019s eating utensils and food\nn A void pre-chewing or blowing on the child\u2019s food \nto cool it off\nn A void licking the child\u2019s pacifier before giving it to \nthe child\nn P ractice daily flossing and at least twice daily \nbrushing with fluoridated toothpaste\nn D o not share toothbrushes among family members\nn R inse with a prescribed chlorhexidine rinse\nn Use x ylitol gum/lozenges 4 to 5 times daily, after \neating  .  To get the most benefit from a product, \nread the ingredient label; xylitol should be listed \nas one of the first 3 ingredients, preferably first  .\nn Ha ve regular dental visits at least twice a year, or \nas often as the dentist recommends\nMaking Referrals\nMake sure you refer a pregnant woman to a dentist for an oral health examination if she:\nn Has not been t o the dentist in the past 6 months\nn Sho ws any signs or symptoms of oral disease \nor trauma, such as tooth decay, mouth pain, swelling around the jaws, missing/broken/loose \nteeth, or sore and/or bleeding gums\nEvery woman who is considering pregnancy should \nhave a dental examination, including a periodontal \nevaluation  . Dental emergencies such as pain and \ninfection should be treated immediately  .  n Dental caries (tooth decay): The dentist should treat decayed teeth and introduce a preventive \nplan to reduce bacterial counts  .  The use of \nchlorhexidine rinses, xylitol chewing gum, and topical fluoride application during pregnancy \nmay be useful in reducing the levels of decay-\ncausing bacteria in the mother\u2019s mouth  .\nn Gingivitis (gum disease): If you suspect the \npregnant woman has gum disease, which may \ninclude periodontal infection, refer her to a dentist \nimmediately  .

Dental caries \nresults when bacteria in the mouth metabolize certain foods and sugars to produce acids that destroy \n(demineralize) tooth surfaces and underlying tooth \nstructure resulting in a cavity  .  The primary bacterium \ncausing tooth decay is Streptococcus mutans  .  The \ncaries process usually begins with the passing of \nbacteria to the child from the caretaker\u2019s mouth, \nusually the mother  .  A mother who has untreated \ndental caries appears to be more likely to pass the \nbacteria to her child  .  Decay-causing bacteria can \nalso be passed to a child from the father, other family \nmembers, and other caretakers  .\nHow does the transmission occur?Some likely ways of passing bacteria in the caregiver\u2019s \nsaliva to the child\u2019s mouth are:\nn C aregiver and child share eating utensils and food\nn C aregiver pre-chews or blows on the child\u2019s food \nto cool it off\nn C aregiver shares the same toothbrush with the child\nn C aregiver \u201ccleans\u201d the child\u2019s pacifier by licking it\nHow to reduce caretaker-child transmission:\nn T he caretaker should have any active tooth decay \ntreated by a dentist as soon as possible\nn A dentist or ph ysician may prescribe antimicrobial (germ killing) rinses like chlorhexidine during the \nprenatal and postnatal periods, and make other \nefforts to decrease the levels of Streptococcus \nmutans in the mother\u2019s mouth\nn X ylitol chewing gum may be recommended, \n4-5 times a day, after eating  .  Xylitol can kill \nStreptococcus mutans and other decay-causing \nbacteria and does not cause tooth decay  .\nn T he caregiver should not share utensils, food, or \ntoothbrush with the child, nor lick the pacifier\nWhy early prevention and treatment for the child?\nn I f tooth decay goes untreated during the first \nyears of life, the child is more likely to have cavities in both the primary and permanent teeth\nn A ttention to a child\u2019s oral health will prevent pain \nand the complications associated with tooth decay and cavities\nSteps to Take\nIdeally, infant oral care begins with prenatal oral \nhealth counseling for parents  .  \nHow to help parents prevent dental caries from occurring:\n1.  E ducate Parents.

To \nhelp their child, parents can:\nn Choose f oods that do not have a lot of sugar in \nthem  . High fructose corn syrup is type of liquid \nsugar commonly found in processed foods and \ndrinks  .  Sugar combined with bacterial plaque \ncreates acid that destroys teeth  .\nn Giv e a child fresh fruits and vegetables instead \nof candy, cookies, and juice drinks  .\nn D o not put the baby to sleep with a bottle \ncontaining anything other than water\nn A void sweets between meals  .  Save sweets for \ndessert after a meal  .\n I mportance of fluoride for healthy teeth\nn A s soon as teeth start to erupt (push through \nthe gums) into the mouth, parents should start brushing their children\u2019s teeth every day with a \nsoft toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste n Limit the amount of t oothpaste to a tiny dab \nor smear to minimize fluoride ingestion\nn P arents should also be advised to teach their \nchildren to spit out the toothpaste during and \nafter brushing\nn I nform parents about the need to use fluoride \nsupplements if the community water is not \nfluoridated  .  Parents should contact their \ndentist or physician for a prescription\nn A sk the child\u2019s dentist or pediatrician about \nthe need for a topical fluoride application, \nsuch as fluoride varnish  . Medi-Cal medical \nproviders can apply fluoride varnish up to 3 \ntimes a year for children under age 6  .\nn M others and other caregivers should use \nantimicrobial (germ killing) fluoride mouth rinses \n B ecause a mother can transmit decay-causing \nbacteria to a child, the control of her own oral health is the key in preventing the transmission \nof bacteria to the child  .  Chewing xylitol gum for 5 \nminutes, 4 to 5 times a day, after eating, will help \nreduce the level of these bacteria in her mouth  .\n2.  T ake the child to a pediatric dentist or general \ndentist within the first year of life or as soon \nas the first tooth comes in. Not all dentists are comfortable seeing very young children, so you may need to help your patients identify dentists trained to see children, called Pediatric Dentists or \nPedodontists  .

Quitting or cutting down is a high priority.\nStages of Quitting\nIndividuals who stop using tobacco typically go through the following 6 stages of quitting. It is common to try to quit several times before being successful. Use the Stages of Quitting to assess the client\u2019s readiness to quit or cut down on using \ntobacco.\n1.  No Interest: not considering quitting or \nmotivated to quit.\n2. Somewhat Interested: uncomfortable with tobacco use but not seriously considering quitting.\n3. Preparation: intends to quit in the near future; has made small changes in tobacco use behaviors.\n4. Action: makes an effort to quit; has made a firm decision to quit; needs support techniques to \ncope with urges to use tobacco.\n5. Maintenance: able to overcome the temptation \nto uuse tobacco; developing alternative healthy \nhabits, but still vulnerable to the urge to use \ntobacco.\n6. Relapse: prompted to use tobacco by stress; disappointed and less confident that quitting is \npossible.Goal\nHelp your client:\nn Identify r isks associated with the use of tobacco \nproducts\nn St op smoking or consider reducing tobacco use\nn R efer her to treatment for tobacco use\nn P rotect non-smokers from exposure to \nsecondhand and thirdhand smoke\nBackground\nTobacco use includes much more than cigarettes  .  A \ntobacco product is any product containing, made, or \nderived from tobacco or nicotine that is intended for \nhuman consumption  . Examples of tobacco products \ninclude electronic smoking devices (e-cigarettes, vape pens, mods, devices shaped like USB flash drives \n(e .g ., Juul), etc  . )), little cigars or cigarillos, waterpipes \n(e .g ., hookah/shisha), smokeless tobacco, and snus  .\nApproximately 7  .2% of women in the U  . S  .  smoke \ncigarettes during pregnancy  .  In California, 1  . 6% of \npregnant women smoke cigarettes  .  \nCigarette smoking can cause complications during pregnancy and increase health risks to the infant/\nchild in later years  .  Health risks can be lessened as \nsoon as a woman stops smoking  .  Stopping before \nthe 4th month has the greatest benefits  .  \nComplications during pregnancy:\nn S erious problems with the placenta, such as \nplacenta previa or placenta abruption\nn V aginal bleeding\nn Miscarriage\nn P reterm birth\nn Stillbirth\nn T he risks from smoking increase the more a \nwoman smokes and the longer she smokes  .  \nPregnant women aged 35 and older who smoke are at higher risk for pregnancy complications  .  A \ndecrease in smoking may lower the risk of harm \nto the unborn baby  .\nComplications for the infant and/or \nchild in later years:\nn I mpaired lung and brain development\nn L ow birth weight and/or poor growth (small for \ngestational age (SGA))\nn Sudden I nfant Death Syndrome (SIDS)\nn Bir th defects and physical malformations such as \ncleft lip or cleft palate\nn L earning disorders and behavioral problems\nNote: Some pregnant clients want an early birth or \nsmall baby due to fear of labor and delivery  .  They may \nPage updated 2019HE  |  112\nSTEPS TO TAKEHEALTH EDUCATIONT obacco Use\nuse this as a reason to keep using tobacco  .  Babies \nborn preterm under these conditions are more likely \nto have severe and lasting disabilities and health \nproblems (see Preterm Labor Guidelines for more \ninformation on risks for preterm babies)  .\nQuitting tobacco use before the 4th month has the \ngreatest benefits, but any decrease is beneficial to \nthe health of the pregnant woman and her unborn \nbaby  .  \u201cLight\u201d or \u201cmild\u201d cigarettes or electronic smoking \ndevices are not a safer choice during pregnancy  .\nThe baby will be healthier if the client does not \nsmoke while breastfeeding  .  The chemicals in tobacco \nsmoke are passed from the breast milk to the baby  .\nElectronic Smoking Devices\nElectronic smoking devices (also called e-cigarettes or \nvaping devices) are tobacco products that heat liquid \nsolutions (e  . g . , e-liquids and nicotine salts) and turn \nthe liquids into aerosol which is inhaled by the user  . \nThese solutions can contain nicotine, propylene glycol, \nflavoring ingredients, and other additives  .  Propylene \nglycol aerosols can cause eye and respiratory irritation \nto users and non-users, and inhaling the chemical \ncan increase the risk of developing asthma  . Flavoring \ningredients associated with respiratory problems have \nbeen found in e-liquids  .  E-cigarettes are also known to \nemit chemicals that are on California\u2019s Proposition 65 list of chemicals linked to cancer, birth defects, or other \nreproductive harm  . \nNicotine is a highly addictive neurotoxin  . The use of \nnicotine-containing products during pregnancy can result in harmful health effects such as impaired fetal \ndevelopment of the brain and lungs, sudden infant \ndeath syndrome, deficits in auditory processing, and \nobesity  .  In large doses, nicotine can cause nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhea, salivation, bradycardia, seizures, \nand respiratory depression  . Some e-cigarette \ncartridges and pods can contain a high concentration of nicotine that, if ingested by a child, could lead to \nnicotine poisoning or even death  . E-cigarettes are not regulated and have not been proven to be a safe and effective tobacco cessation \naid . Thus, chemicals found in e-liquids and other \nsolutions may not be consistent with product \nlabeling  .  Clients should be aware of the health \nrisks and complications that are associated with \ne-cigarette use  .\nSmokeless tobacco (chewing or snuff ) and water pipe smoking (hookahs, shisha) can also cause \ncomplications during pregnancy such as preterm \nbirth, stillbirth, or low birthweight and increase health \nrisks to the infant/child in later years  .  Clients are \ndiscouraged from using any tobacco products  .\nSteps to Take\nFor clients who do not use tobacco \nproducts: (using the Four As - see \nside panel)\nPraise her healthy lifestyle and ask if she knows \nthe dangers of tobacco use for her and her baby  .  \nEncourage her not to begin while she is pregnant\u2014\nor ever!\nFor clients who do use tobacco \nproducts:\nState, \u201cI am glad you told me about your use of \ntobacco  .

There is no safe \nlevel of exposure to tobacco smoke.Goal\nHelp your client:\nn Identify wher e she may be exposed to \nsecondhand and/or thirdhand smoke\nn T ake steps so she and her family can avoid \nsecondhand and/or thirdhand smoke\nn T alk to family members/friends if they expose her \nto secondhand smoke\nBackground\nSecondhand Smoke\nSecondhand smoke is the smoke emitted from \nproducts, such as cigarettes, electronic smoking \ndevices, cigars, pipes, hookah/waterpipes, or cannabis  . \nSecondhand smoke is also smoke that has been \nexhaled, or breathed out, by the person smoking  . \nSecondhand smoke is a serious health hazard \ncausing close to 42,000 deaths per year  .  Tobacco \nsmoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals that are harmful; about 70 of these chemicals are known to \ncause cancer  .\nStudies have found that exposure to secondhand smoke in women is associated with uterine cancer, \ncervical cancer, heart disease, asthma, respiratory \nillnesses, and breast cancer  .\nWhen a pregnant woman breathes secondhand \nsmoke, less oxygen will reach the unborn baby  .  Without \nenough oxygen, her baby is likely to weigh less  .\nSecondhand smoke increases a baby\u2019s risk of dying \nfrom Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)  .\nBabies and children suffer many ill effects \nfrom breathing secondhand smoke, including \npneumonia, bronchitis, ear infections, asthma, and \nslowed lung growth  .Exposure to fine and ultrafine particles from \nsecondhand electronic smoking device aerosol may \nexacerbate respiratory illnesses like asthma and are \nknown to have an immediate negative impact on \nthe cardiovascular system  . Exposure to secondhand \naerosol can also be harmful to the baby\u2019s growing lungs and expose babies and children to nicotine and \nother harmful chemicals  .  \nBreathing marijuana smoke can also lead to health problems for both your client and her baby because, \nlike tobacco smoke, it lowers oxygen levels, introduces \ntoxins into the body and harms the lungs  .\nThirdhand Smoke\nThirdhand smoke is the chemical residue from \ntobacco smoke that settles on clothes, hair, furniture, \ndrapes, carpets, counters and other surfaces  .  \nThirdhand smoke is a source for long-term exposure to harmful pollutants, which have been shown to \ndamage human cells and DNA, and may be linked to \nhealth problems such as asthma and cancer  .\nInfants and children spend more time indoors and \nhave age-specific behaviors (crawling, mouthing \nhousehold objects, active playing near the floor) \nthat can increase exposure to thirdhand smoke in \nenvironments where smoking has occurred  .\nEven when parents and caregivers only smoke outdoors, children are not fully protected from \ntobacco exposure because thirdhand smoke remains \non the clothes, skin, and hair of smokers, and smoke \ncan drift indoors  .\nAerosol from e-cigarettes can also remain on indoor surfaces long after use, which exposes babies and \nchildren to nicotine and other harmful chemicals  .\nPage updated 2019HE  |  118\nSTEPS TO TAKEHEALTH EDUCATIONSecondhand T obacco Smoke\nSteps to Take\nFor all clients:\nDiscuss the dangers of exposure to all forms of \nsecondhand and thirdhand smoke.\nLook for second-and thirdhand smoke exposure: Clients \nmay be exposed to smoke from cigarettes, cigars, pipes, \nhookah/waterpipes, electronic smoking devices, or \nmarijuana at home, at work, in a car, in public places, \nor in other situations  .  All exposure should be avoided \nif possible  .  Encourage her to avoid all smoke, even at \noccasional visits to friends or other places  .\nUse the Four A\u2019s Model \nAssist a client in reducing her exposure to \nsecondhand smoke:\nn Ask about her frequency of smoke exposure, and \nwhere and when she is around secondhand smoke  .\nn Advise her to avoid all smoke and discuss the \nnegative health effects caused by secondhand \nand thirdhand smoke  .\nn Assist her in finding ways to avoid secondhand \nand thirdhand smoke  .  Suggest direct \ncommunication with smokers, or taking indirect \nactions such as posting signs in the home \nor bringing home pamphlets  .  She might like \nto invite a supportive family member to her \nappointment to help find ways to avoid smoke  .  \nn Arrange to follow up on her plan to reduce her \nexposure to smoke  .  Congratulate her on plans \nshe makes  .\nIf appropriate, give the client the handout Keep Your Baby Safe and Healthy which mentions avoiding \nsecondhand smoke  .\nFollow Up\nAt the next visit, ask about her success in avoiding \nsecondhand smoke  .  Track progress in her chart \nand follow up at each appointment with support, \nsuggestions, and resources  .Resources\nThe Tobacco Education Clearinghouse of \nCalifornia (TECC)\nTECC provides a variety of low cost educational \nmaterials on tobacco use, smoking cessation, and \nsecondhand smoke materials  .

There is no safe level of drug or alcohol \nuse for pregnant women. Many over-the-counter \nand prescription drugs can also harm unborn babies. Alcohol use is the leading preventable cause of birth defects.\nThe Risks\nDuring pregnancy, drugs and alcohol can travel \nthrough the mother\u2019s blood (across the placenta) to \nthe unborn baby and cause the following problems:\nn  M iscarriages or physical abnormalities\nn Slo w growth and premature birth\nn I ncreased risk for medical complications, \npreterm labor, and death of the baby\nn I ncreased risk for abnormal facial features\nn I ncreased risk of death for babies before their \nfirst birthday (SIDS), low birth weight, central \nnervous system damage, withdrawal effects, \nphysical malformations, and developmental \ndisorders that show up when they are olderGoal\nHelp your client:\nn Identify r isks with use of alcohol, over-the-counter \n(OTC) drugs, and street drugs\nn St op or reduce any substance use \nn S eek treatment\nBackground\nDrinking alcohol or using drugs can cause tragic \nconsequences for the unborn baby  .\nAlcohol and drugs can travel through the mother\u2019s \nblood (across the placenta) and enter the baby\u2019s \nblood  .  This exposure can cause babies to have \nphysical, mental, and/or behavioral problems  .  \nAlthough not every baby will have obvious problems, \nno one can predict which child will be affected  .\nThe good news is that many women who have been using drugs or alcohol on a long-term basis may \nwant to quit during pregnancy  .\nHarm to the unborn baby can occur at any time during \npregnancy  .  It is never too late to stop drinking or doing \ndrugs when a woman is pregnant  .

Women who \nare unsure if they want more children tend to be \nless successful using birth control  .  They have more \nunplanned pregnancies  .\nThe best time to discuss family planning is in the \nclient\u2019s third trimester  .  A woman who chooses her \nbirth control method before delivery will be better \nprepared to use her method soon after delivery  .  To \nensure the best outcome for the next pregnancy, wait at least 18 months before becoming pregnant \nagain  . Having enough time between children helps \nparents cope with the demands of childrearing and \nwith finances  .  It allows parents to provide physical, \nemotional, and intellectual nurturing for each child  .\nSome clients may have become pregnant through \ndonor insemination  . Such clients may want to discuss \nplans for future children  . When talking to clients, \nuse a non-judgmental and non-assuming interview \nstyle  .  Ask open-ended questions to find out the most \nappropriate way to provide family planning  .\nSteps to Take\nFor all clients:\nn Explain the r easons you are talking about family \nplanning: \nu S o the client can be ready to begin using her \nmethod after delivery u S o she doesn\u2019t get pregnant immediately \nafter having this baby unless she wants to  .\nn Help clar ify her plans for having more children in \nthe future:\nu A sk the client what her plans are for having \nchildren in the future  .\nu A sk her what methods of birth control she has \nused  .

Barrier \nmethods (condoms, diaphragms, caps, sponge, and foam) may be the best \nchoice for occasional protection  .

A baby born weighing 5 pounds, 8 \nounces or less is considered low birth weight.\nPreeclampsia/Toxemia: Another terms for this \nis gestational hypertension. Twin pregnancies \nare twice as likely as single pregnancies to have \npreeclampsia.\nPreterm Birth: The biggest risk associated with \nmultiple pregnancies is that the babies will be born \nearly, before 37 weeks. This is called preterm or \npremature labor. Nearly half of all twins are born prematurely. With 3 or more babies, there is an \neven higher risk of premature birth.\nShared Placenta: Each baby can either have a \nseparate placenta or share a placenta with 1 or more others. When multiples share a placenta, 1 \nbaby may get too much blood flow and the other \nmay get too little. They are at risk for a condition known as twin-to-twin-transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Only about 10% of identical twins who \nshare a placenta will develop TTTS.Goals\nHelp your client:\nn Understand the diff erence between identical and \nfraternal twins\nn Understand the health r isks associated with \nmultiple births\nn R educe the risks associated with multiple births\nn M ake realistic plans for postpartum care of her babies\nn D evelop a support system\nBackground\nThe birth of twins, triplets, or more is called a multiple \nbirth  . Multiple births are much more common \ntoday than in the past for two reasons  .  First, more \nwomen over 30 are getting pregnant and women \nover 34 years of age have a higher chance of having \nmultiples  .  Second, more women are becoming \npregnant with the help of infertility treatments  .\nIdentical twins or fraternal twins? Twins can be either \nidentical or fraternal  .  The difference is the number of \nfertilized eggs  .  For identical twins, there is 1 fertilized \negg .  This single fertilized egg splits into 2 identical \nfertilized eggs early in the pregnancy  .  Two identical \nbabies develop, sharing the same sex, blood type, and \neye and hair color  .  Identical twins usually have their own \namniotic sac and may or may not share a placenta  .\nIf there is more than 1 fertilized egg, the twins will be \nfraternal  .  In this case, each egg is fertilized by a different \nsperm  . Because each baby is created by a different egg \nand a different sperm, these babies may not look alike  . \nThey can be different sexes or the same sex  . Each baby \nwill have its own amniotic sac and its own placenta  .\nWhen there are more than 2 babies, these babies can be identical, fraternal, or a combination of \nboth  . When there are more than 2 babies (triplets, \nquadruplets, etc  . ) the babies are referred to as \nmultiples (and sometimes, \u201csupertwins\u201d)  .Steps to Take\nFor all clients expecting multiples:\nn F ind out how twins and multiples are handled in \nyour practice  .

Eating right means eating a balanced \ndiet and taking prenatal vitamins  .  A client expecting \nmultiples should have regular visits with a dietician  .\nTo find the recommended weight gain for women \ncarrying twins, see the \u201cNutrition\u201d section  .\nWomen carrying more than 2 babies should discuss their \nrecommended weight gain with their medical provider  .\nExercise and Rest\nRegular non-stressful exercise in important  . However, \nas the babies grow the client may need to reduce her \nactivity level and rest more  .\nWhen resting, a client may want to rest part of the \ntime on her left side  .  This allows blood to flow more \nfreely, with less pressure from her expanding uterus  .\nClients who have physically demanding jobs or are experiencing preterm labor may have to rest more \nor stop work early  .  Help the client make plans for a \nleave of absence from work  .  Also help the client plan \nfor finding help with her children, housework, etc  . , \nespecially if she is on bed rest  .\nHelping a Family Prepare for the \nArrival of Multiples\nThe arrival of multiples has a major impact on the family  . \nEveryone in the household can expect to sleep less \ndue to the demands of 24-hour baby care  .  Preparing \nahead for the babies will help everyone to manage well during the first few weeks  .  What can a client do to \nprepare herself and her family? Some ideas are listed \nbelow  .  As time permits, you may want to integrate this \ninformation into your discussion with your client  .\nSupport \nThe client will need to ask friends and family for extra \nhelp  .  She will need to find people to help with daily \nchores, care for the babies and older siblings, and to \ngive her time to sleep and take care of herself  .\nThe client can ask a friend or relative to come over and take care of the babies during the evening while \nthe parents get a few hours of unbroken sleep  .\nShe can also get support from a local mothers of twins \n(and multiples) club  .  Connect her with local club(s) \nusing the handout Getting Ready for Multiples  .\nIdentifying the babiesAt first it may be difficult to tell the babies apart, \neven if they do not look very similar  .  Sleepy parents \nmay temporarily mix them up and even feed 1 of \nthe babies twice  .  If the babies look very similar, it is \nhelpful to mark the toe of 1 with nail polish  . Another \nidea is to dress the babies in different colors and/or \ndifferent styles of clothing  .\nClothingSecondhand children\u2019s clothing stores are an \ninexpensive place to get clothes  .\nHow parents dress multiples influences whether \nothers relate to the babies as a group or as individuals  . \nNewborn multiples are not greatly affected by the \npublic notice they receive when dressed differently  . \nHowever, when multiples are dressed alike all the time, they can become so used to the \u201cstar effect\u201d that they \nmay feel lost without their co-multiple(s)  .\nSiblingsIt is wise to prepare older siblings by explaining that \nthe new babies will be identical or fraternal, and \nallow them to participate in the preparations  .  They HE  |  144\nSTEPS TO TAKEHEALTH EDUCATIONMultiple Births \u2013 T wins and More\nmay want to help arrange the babies\u2019 clothes and \nfurniture  .  The babies will more easily win the hearts \nof their older siblings if they come home from the \nhospital with a small gift for each sister or brother  .  \nSometimes it is helpful for the older siblings to have \ntheir own \u201cmultiples\u201d as dolls or bears  .  Then they can \nsafely express their mixed emotions about the real \nbabies  .  Parents can remind visitors to pay attention to \nthe older children by taping a note to the front door \nthat says, \u201cPlease talk to the big kids first  .\u201d\nTransportation\nEach baby will need its own car seat in order to leave \nthe hospital  .  The family will eventually need a stroller \nwith a seat for each baby  .  Having the car seats and \nstrollers will help the family get out for appointments \nand to shop for food, etc  . , and will help prevent the \nrisk of isolation  .\nSpecial Needs and LossIf any of the babies have a special need there will \nbe additional stress on the entire family  .  The family \nwill have to learn to meet this baby\u2019s special needs, \nand will need extra support from friends, family, etc  .  \nIf 1 of the babies dies, the parents will have the task of mourning while caring for the other babies (see \nPerinatal Loss\n in the \u201cPsychosocial\u201d section)  .\nSupplies\nThe safety of cobedding twins and multiples have \nnot been established  .  It is prudent to provide a \nseparate sleep surface and avoid cobedding in the \nhospital and at home  .  The babies can share baby \nsupplies (lotions, diapers, etc)  . The client may want \nto ask a friend for help shopping for supplies, as \nmultiples use up supplies very quickly  .\nAt first they won\u2019t need many toys  .  As they grow, they \ncan easily share some toys  .  They will also each need \ntheir own toys, even if the toys are the same, like pull \ntoys or stuffed animals  .BondingWhen there are 2 or more babies, parents may first \nbond with the whole group, and then connect with \neach baby in special ways  .  If 1 of the babies has to \nstay in the hospital, the parents will need to make a \nspecial effort to stay connected with all the babies  .\nBreastfeeding\nBreast milk gives the best nutrition and immunity \nand is especially beneficial for premature infants  .  A \nregistered dietitian should work with the mother in adjusting her diet because it can take a while to \ncomfortably adapt to breastfeeding  .  The mother \nwill be deciding what positions work best for her \nto breastfeed her babies  .  Some mothers like to \nfeed 2 babies at the same time, while others prefer \nindividual feedings  .\nSome mothers may choose to feed their babies \nformula as well as breast milk on occasion  . If any of \nthe babies are hospitalized, the mother will need \nto pump breast milk for their feedings  .  With lots of \nencouragement, it is possible to breast and bottle \nfeed multiples  .  See the Breastfeeding Guidelines in the \n\u201cNutrition\u201d section  .\nBottle feedingIf a client chooses to bottle feed, the mother will \nneed to learn how to feed the babies together \nwithout propping up their bottles  .  She will want to \nrotate them from feeding to feeding so each baby \nhas time in her arms  .\nSleep \nIt may help for the adults in the household to take \nturns sleeping through the night  . The client may \nwant to ask a friend or relative to care for the babies during the evening while the parents catch a few \nhours of unbroken sleep  .  Once the babies are on the \nsame schedule for feeding and sleeping, it will be \neasier to find time to rest  .\nPage updated 2019HE  |  145\nHealth Education Handout\nSTEPS TO TAKE\nHaving more than 1 baby is an exciting time  .

Pregnant women need more calories, \nprotein, iron, folic acid, and other vitamins and \nminerals than before pregnancy  .  After the first \ntrimester, normal-weight women need an average \nof only 300 additional calories a day while pregnant  . \nExcess calories during pregnancy puts the mother at \nrisk for excess weight gain that may lead to maternal \nand infant negative outcomes  .  Actual additional \ncalorie needs depend on a woman\u2019s pre-pregnant \nweight, height, age and activity level  .  Breastfeeding \nwomen also need increased nutrients and calories \nbased on their breastfeeding status  .  Refer to \nChooseMyPlate  . gov-Health and Nutrition Information \nfor Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Women ( www  .\nchoosemyplate  . gov/pregnancy-breastfeeding  . html ) \nto guide women to make healthy eating choices, \ntrack their food intake and weight gain, and set \nhealthy eating goals  .  Use the handout MyPlate for \nMoms to guide women to make healthy choices and \nget the nutrients and calories they need  .\nA healthy weight and good nutrition prior to \nconception plays an important role in fetal \ndevelopment and birth outcomes  .  Lower rates of \nspinal column defects in newborns have been found when mothers took supplements of multivitamins \nprior to or around the period of conception  . It is \nnow recommended that all women of childbearing age eat folate rich foods and a vitamin supplement \ncontaining 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid  .\nInadequate food access and intake, extremes in weight status, eating disorders, severely restricted \ndiets, chronic medical conditions, and tobacco, \nalcohol, or other substance use are some of the factors that may impair a woman\u2019s health and \nnutritional status and the health of her baby  .Good nutrition during pregnancy also helps prepare \nwomen for breastfeeding  .  Gaining the appropriate \namount of weight is important to meet the energy \nneeds of breastfeeding  .  Consuming adequate \nnutrients maintains the woman\u2019s nutrient stores  .  \nPostpartum is the time to replace needed nutrients, normalize weight and continue a foundation of good \nnutrition to foster the health of the entire family  .\nThe Role of the Registered \nDietitian\nCertain medical conditions, social factors, and dietary \npractices can affect a woman\u2019s need for calories, \nnutrients, and diet composition  . Women with special \nneeds or complex conditions may benefit from a \nconsultation with a registered dietitian (RD)  . The RD can \nprovide additional assessment and medical nutrition therapy to control or alleviate complex conditions such \nas diabetes and hyperemesis gravidarium  . Specialized \nnutrition services are recommended for, but not limited to, the following conditions:\nAnthropometric \nUnderweight: Prepregnancy weight <90% desirable body weight \nVery overweight: Prepregnancy weight >135% \ndesirable body weight CPSP Nutrition Services\nOngoing nutrition services are an \nimportant aspect of a woman\u2019s prenatal \nand postpartum care. See the CPSP \nProvider Handbook for a description of nutrition \nassessment requirements, clarification of basic \nversus specialized care, description of required \nnutrition assessment skills, nutrition risk conditions warranting involvement of skilled nutrition professionals, billing information for nutrition \nservices, and making client referrals.NUTR  |  6\nSTEPS TO TAKENUTRITIONIntroduction\n1st Trimester: Excessive weight loss \n2nd or 3rd Trimester: Excessive or inadequate weight \ngain \nBiochemical \nn Anemia: Hemoglobin (Hgb) <10  . 5-11  . 0 g/dL \nHematocrit (Hct) <33 vol% Mean Corpuscular \nVolume (MCV ): <83 cu mi or >95 cu mi (folate \ndeficiency) \nn 1st tr imester 85 -97  . 8 \u00b5m3, 2nd trimester 85  . 8 - \n99 .4 \u00b5m3, 3rd trimester 82  .4 - 100  .4 \u00b5m3 (higher \nlevels can indicate B12 or folate deficiency)\nn Glucose I ntolerance: (results of 75 gram, 2-hour \nOral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) having any \nvalue above cut off: Fasting: \u226592 mg/dL 1 hr \u2265180 \nmg/dL 2 hr \u2265153 mg/dL (Note: ACOG still prefers \na 2 step screening for GDM  .

Complex or high-risk \nconditions requiring specialized nutrition care by \nthe registered dietitian or medical provider are not \nincluded  .\nNutrition Assessment\nAll nutrition services begin with an assessment of anthropometric, biochemical, clinical, and dietary \ndata to identify key nutrition issues affecting the \nwoman and her pregnancy  .  This information is used \nto develop an individual nutrition plan to help access, \nselect, prepare, and eat healthy and safe foods during \nher pregnancy and maintain healthy eating habits \nthroughout her life  .\nAssessment Guidelines\nComplete an initial nutrition assessment and \nindividualized care plan on every client within four \nweeks of entry into care  .  If the client declines the \nassessment, document this in her chart  . Offer the \nassessment at future visits  .  Some clients may need to \nbe offered the assessments several times  .\nOffer nutrition reassessments at least once every \ntrimester and at the postpartum visit  . High-risk clients \nmay need more interventions and may be seen \nmore frequently  .

Weight gain during \npregnancy is called \u201cgestational weight gain\u201d  .  Weight \ngain recommendations have changed over the years and the guidelines included here present the most \nrecent research on healthy gestational weight gain  .\nThere is no single amount of weight gain that is right \nfor all women  . Recommended weight gain depends \non a woman\u2019s pre-pregnancy height and weight  . \nAn underweight woman needs to gain more than \nan overweight or obese woman  . Women starting \npregnancy obese need to gain the least amount of \nweight  . The rate of weight gain is also important  . \nMonitoring weight at each visit and plotting on a \nweight gain grid is the expected CPSP standard of care  . \nProviding women with personalized weight gain goals and education is important for a healthy birth \noutcome and the long-term health of a woman \nand her baby  .  Studies indicate that the majority of \nwomen are not receiving consistent or appropriate \nadvice about weight gain and that most women gain \nbeyond weight gain recommendations  .  CPSP offers \nan important opportunity for personalized weight gain education and counseling during pregnancy \nand postpartum  . A healthy weight postpartum is vital \nfor the woman\u2019s health and the healthy outcomes of \nfuture pregnancies  .\nRisks of Unhealthy  \nPreconception Weight\nToday nearly half of California women enter \npregnancy overweight or obese, with African-\nAmerican and Hispanic woman experiencing \nthe highest rates (Maternal and Infant Health \nAssessment (MIHA), 2009)  . Women entering \npregnancy overweight or obese are at higher risk for gestational diabetes, pregnancy-related high \nblood pressure, premature delivery, cesarean section, and postpartum weight retention  . Infants born to \noverweight or obese women have higher rates of \ndelivery complications and increased risk of birth \ndefects, high birth weight, and obesity later in life  .  \nIt is not advised to encourage overweight or obese \nwomen to restrict their dietary intake to lose weight  . \nIt is important that all women eat adequate nutrients \nand calories to support a healthy pregnancy  .\nWomen entering pregnancy under a healthy weight are at higher risk for premature delivery, low birth \nweight, and a baby that faces higher risks of chronic \ndiseases in later life such as high blood pressure, type \n2 diabetes, and heart disease  .  Underweight women \nare more at risk of inadequate weight gain, which \nincreases possible pregnancy complications and risks  .\nRisks of Low Gestational Weight Gain\nWomen who gain less than the recommended amount of weight during pregnancy are more likely \nto have low birth weight infants and poor pregnancy \noutcomes  .  Babies born small may be at greater risk \nfor high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and heart \ndisease later in life  .  Women who are young, smoke, or \nbegin pregnancy underweight are especially at risk \nfor not gaining enough weight during pregnancy  .\nRisks of High Gestational  \nWeight Gain\nWomen with high weight gain are more likely to \ndeliver high birth weight infants increasing the risk \nof labor and delivery complications and increased \ncesarean sections  .  High weight gain may increase \nthe risk of gestational diabetes, hypertension, \npreeclampsia, and permanent increases in weight \nleading to overweight and obesity  .  Helping women \navoid high weight gain is important, especially for nulliparous women as they tend to experience the \nhighest weight gain  . Weight restriction outside of the \nweight gain recommendations or weight loss during pregnancy should be discussed between the health \ncare provider and the woman  .NUTR  |  10\nSTEPS TO TAKENUTRITIONWeight Gain During Pregnancy\nWeight Gain Guidelines\nThese guidelines are based on of the Institute \nof Medicine\u2019s (IOM) 2009 Weight Gain During \nPregnancy: Re-examining the Guidelines report  . \nThese guidelines encourage women to gain weight according to their pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index \n(BMI) category  .  BMI is a number calculated using a \nperson\u2019s weight and height (kg/m2 or 703 x weight (lbs) / ht2 (inches)) and provides a reliable indicator of \nbody fatness for most people  .\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention offers BMI assessment tools at: \nwww  . cdc . gov/\nhealthyweight/assessing/bmi/index  .html \nWomen who smoke, adolescents, African Americans and women of short stature are encouraged to \ngain within their BMI weight gain category without \nany modifications to their gestational weight gain \nrecommendation  . Weight gain is recommended for \nobese women and weight loss or weight restriction is \nnot recommended as a general rule  .  The current IOM \nguidelines strongly encourage health care providers to offer all pregnant women counseling on healthy \neating and physical activity to help women gain \nwithin their recommended weight range and return \nto a healthy postpartum weight  .\nRecommended Total Gestational \nWeight Gain\nPre-pregnancy weight is divided into four BMI \ncategories  .  There is a recommended total weight \ngain range and a weekly weight gain rate for each \nBMI weight category  .  A woman\u2019s BMI category is \ndetermined by her pre-pregnancy weight and height \nusing Table 1 or a BMI calculator ( www  . cdc . gov/\nhealthyweight/assessing/bmi/index  .html ) . Healthy \nbirth outcomes are possible over a wide weight gain \nrange  .

Nutrition During Pregnancy, Part 1, \nWeight Gain  . National Academy Press: Washington, DC  . \n1990  .\nSome women may gain more or less than the \nrecommended amount  . Gains outside the \nrecommended range may be appropriate and it is important for each woman to have a discussion \nwith her provider about her personalized weight \ngain goals and progress  .  There are no new \nrecommendations specific for adolescents or severely \nobese women (BMI 40 or greater)  . It is important for \nseverely obese women and adolescents to discuss \npersonalized weight gain recommendations for \npregnancy with their health care providers  .\nTwins\nThe 2009 IOM report provides guidelines for women \npregnant with twins  .  The guidelines do not give \nspecific recommendations for underweight women \nwith twins or for other multiple births  .BMI Category   Pounds \nNormal weight   37-54  \nOverweight   31-50  \nObese    25-42\nImportance of Assessing and \nMonitoring Gestational Weight Gain\nStarting pregnancy at a healthy weight (normal BMI) \nis best to ensure a healthy outcome for both mother \nand baby  .  All women need to know how much \ntotal weight gain is recommended for their BMI category and stay informed about their weight gain \nprogress  .  Plotting women\u2019s weight on a grid at each \nprenatal visit is important for monitoring weight gain \nprogress  .  The weight gain grid allows the woman to \nclearly see her weight gain progress and helps her learn about the importance of healthy eating and \nphysical activity  .\nIt is important for the health care provider to assess several factors to determine whether gains outside \nthe recommended range are appropriate:\nn T he quality of the woman\u2019s diet\nn An y changes in physical activity patterns\nn T he pattern and total gain during previous \npregnancies and pregnancy outcomes\nn T he age of the woman (very young mothers \nmay gain more for their own growth and older \nmultiparous women may gain less weight)\nn An y pre-existing or new clinical conditions\nBecause weight gain is of vital interest to almost all women, assessing weight gain is an effective way to \nbegin nutrition assessment and education  . Assessing \nweight gain helps identify women in need of referral for in-depth nutrition assessment, education and \nother resources  .  A referral to a registered dietitian \nis recommended for women who enter pregnancy \nobese and/or are gaining outside of the guidelines  .Example\nThe overweight woman in the previous example \nshould gain a total of 15 to 25 pounds and 0.5 to 0.7 \npounds per week after the first trimester.NUTR  |  12\nSTEPS TO TAKENUTRITIONWeight Gain During Pregnancy\nHow to Determine Gestational \nWeight Gain Goals and Assess Weight Gain\nTo determine recommended prenatal weight gain \nand track weight gain progress at each visit, you must \nknow the woman\u2019s height, weight, pre-pregnant \nweight, and number of weeks gestation  . Chart the \nwoman\u2019s weight gain at each visit so she can track \nher progress  .\nFollow the step-by-step directions below:\n1. Det ermine the Woman\u2019s BMI Weight \nCategory by Assessing Her Height and  \nPre-Pregnant Weight:\nn Weight: To obtain an accurate weight, place the scale on firm flooring (tile or wood, not \ncarpet)  . Have the woman remove shoes and \nheavy clothing (coats, jackets, sweatshirts, \netc .)  .  Make sure the woman stands with \nboth feet in the center of the scale  .  Record \nthe woman\u2019s weight to the nearest decimal \nfraction (e  . g . , 155  . 5 pounds)  .\nn Height : Measure the woman without shoes  .  \nHave the woman place her heels, buttocks and shoulder blades (three points of contact) \nagainst the wall or surface, stand up straight \nand look forward, with her head erect and not \ntouching the wall or surface  .\nn Pre-pregnant weight: Ask the woman her weight at the time of her last menstrual cycle \nor refer to her medical record for a recorded \npre-pregnant weight closest to the woman\u2019s \nlast menstrual period  .  Some women do not \nknow their pre-pregnant weight  .\nn BMI: Determine the woman\u2019s BMI weight category using Table 1 located on the page \n13 or use an online BMI calculator such as \nwww  . nhlbisupport  . com/bmi  .n If pre-pregnant weight is unknown and \nthe woman is less than 16 weeks gestation: \nCalculate her BMI category by using the \nearliest first trimester weight available  .  Plot her \nweight on the grid that is appropriate for her \nBMI . Using her current week gestation, plot her \ncurrent weight as normal weight gain  .\n2. F ind the Recommended Range and Second/\nThird Trimester Rate of Weight Gain on Table 1:\nn Each pr epregnant weight category, \nunderweight, normal weight, overweight \nand obese have specific weight gain \nrecommendations\n3. U se the Weight Gain Grid Correctly:\nn Use the w eight gain grid to see if the woman is \ngaining weight within the recommended range\nn T here are weight gain grids for each of the \nfour weight categories: underweight, normal \nweight, overweight and obese\nn Ne w weight gain grids are available for twin \nbirths in three weight categories: normal \nweight, overweight and obese  .  No grid is \navailable for underweight women with twins  .  \nFind weight gain grids in \u201cNutrition Tools\u201d in \nthe Appendix  . \nn Choose the w eight gain grid that matches the \nwoman\u2019s weight category  .  Find weight gain \ngrids in \u201cNutrition Tools\u201d in the Appendix  .\n F eatures of the Weight Gain Grids  \nhttps://www  . cdph  . ca  . gov/Programs/PSB/Pages/\nMCAH  .aspx\nn T he vertical zero line starts at conception\nn T he horizontal zero line represents the \nwoman\u2019s pre-pregnant weight\nn Each hor izontal line above the zero represents \none pound more than the pre-pregnancy weight\nn Each line belo w the zero line is one pound \nless than the woman\u2019s pre-pregnant weightNUTR  |  13\nSTEPS TO TAKENUTRITIONWeight Gain During Pregnancy\nn Each v ertical line represents one more week \ninto the pregnancy; there is a bold vertical \nline for each trimester\nn T he two lines on the weight gain grid \nrepresent the range of weight gain \nconsidered healthy for each BMI category  .  For \nthis example, the recommended range for weight gain for a woman with normal pre-\npregnant weight is 25-35 pounds  .\n4. Plot the Weight Gain Grid:\nn F ill in the information on the correct weight \ngain grid\nn I f the woman is less than 16 weeks gestation, \nweigh and measure the woman and calculate her BMI category by using the earliest first \ntrimester weight \nn W eigh and measure the woman with shoes \noff and light outer clothes only  .  Many women \nappreciate privacy and sensitivity when they \nare weighed and measured  .  Take time to be \naccurate and caring  .\nn C ompare the woman\u2019s weight at each visit with \nher pre-pregnancy weight  . This number equals \nthe number of pounds she has gained or lost  .\nn D etermine the number of weeks gestation on \nthe date she is first weighed\nn P lace a dot on the grid where the line \nrepresenting the number of pounds gained \nor lost crosses the line representing the weeks \nof gestation\nn Check t o see whether the total weight gain \nat this visit falls within the woman\u2019s target \nweight gain range and if she is gaining the \ncorrect amount of weight per week\nn Sho w the woman where her weight falls on the \ngrid .  Discuss her weight gain progress  .  Ask how \nshe feels about her weight gain so far and make \nsure knows her recommended GWG range  .n P lot weight gain at each prenatal visit and assess \nweight gain progress  .  Always subtract the pre-\npregnant weight from the current day\u2019s weight \nmeasurement  .\n5. Plotting W eight When Pre-pregnant Weight \nGain is Unknown:\nn L ook at the woman\u2019s medical record for a \npre-pregnant weight near the time of her last \nmenstrual period\nn I t weight is unknown and the woman is less than \n16 weeks gestation, weigh and measure the woman and use that weight as a pre-pregnant \nweight  . If the woman is past 16 weeks and her \nweight is unknown, refer to the health care provider for a preferred method to estimate pre-\npregnant weight\nn I f the pre-pregnant weight is unknown, make a \nnote in the medical chart and follow your health \ncare provider\u2019s policy and procedures to track \nweight gain and fetal growth\nWhat the Weight Gain Grid Tells You:\nn W eight gain can tell you if the woman is gaining \ntoo fast, too slow, or just right  . The pattern of \nweight gain is as important as the total gain  .\nn T he grid is also a screening tool to identify women \nwho need more in-depth nutritional assessment and \ncounseling  .  Sudden weight gain or loss may signal \npregnancy complications  .\nn When a w oman\u2019s gain is outside the recommended \nrange, assess factors that may affect her weight \ngain  . See the Low Weight Gain and High Weight Gain  \nsections in these guidelines  .\n S ome women may not follow the curves of the \nweight gain grid or may be four or five pounds \nabove or below the recommended line even \nthough they are eating a nutritious diet  . Other \nwomen may be eating too little or too much  . \nFind out what the woman is eating  .  Follow the \nguidelines for Assessing Dietary Intake  .NUTR  |  14\nSTEPS TO TAKENUTRITIONWeight Gain During Pregnancy\nSteps to Take\nFor all women, assess food intake using a 24-Hour \nDietary Recall or other approved dietary recall \nmethod and compare her diet to MyPlate for Moms  . \nAssess if she has the resources to get the healthy \nfoods she needs and if she is on WIC  . \nn If her weight gain is within the recommended \nrange , assess the woman\u2019s diet  . If her diet is fine, \npraise her and encourage her to continue eating \nwell .  Encourage her to have at least 30 minutes of \nmoderate physical activity each day  .  Review her \nfood intake at least each trimester and plot her \nweight gain each visit  .\nn If her weight gain is below the recommended range, review Low Weight Gain\n . Even if the \nwoman is not eating enough of certain foods, look for other factors that may explain the low \nweight gain or weight loss  .\nn If her weight gain is above the recommended range, review High Weight Gain\n . Do not advise \nweight loss  .  Even if the woman is eating too \nmany high calorie foods, look for other factors \nthat may also explain her excess weight gain  .Example: Prenatal Weight Gain Grid\nA woman, five feet, four inches, weighed 140 pounds \nbefore pregnancy. Her pre-pregnancy BMI of 24 is in \nthe normal weight category. She should strive for an \nincrease of about 1 pound per week for a total gain of 25 to 35 pounds.

Specific dietary guidance is \nnot available for obese pregnant and postpartum \nwomen, or for women with gestational diabetes or \nother conditions requiring medical nutrition therapy  .  \nIf using the online interactive tool is not an option, use the MyPlate for Moms handout for both pregnant \nand breastfeeding women  .\nThere is no one required method or form you must use to assess a woman\u2019s diet at her initial, \nreassessment, or postpartum visit  .

Experts \nhave found the best results come from using a step-by-\nstep method  .  For a more complete picture of what the \nwoman ate in the last 24 hours, follow these steps: \nBefore you begin, always explain what you are going \nto do  .\nI am going to ask you to tell me everything you ate and \ndrank during the last 24 hours. I will ask questions to get \nthe most accurate food intake possible. I will compare \nyour food intake with a food guide that includes all the nutrients and energy you need for a healthy pregnancy (or \nfor postpartum and breastfeeding needs). Please be sure \nyou tell me everything you ate or drank, even the small things like butter, salad dressings, cream, and candies, so I \ncan give you the best healthy eating information possible.\nStep 1: Make a Quick List\nMake a quick list of everything the woman ate or \ndrank during the 24-hour period  .  Write the food \ndown on the 24-Hour Perinatal Dietary Recall in the \n\u201cFood\u201d column  . Write down one main food item per \nline . Do not worry about serving sizes or the time the \nfood was eaten during Step 1  .\nKey Points:\nn B egin in the morning after the woman woke up \nand write down all the food she ate in a 24-hour \ntime period\nn A void using words like breakfast, lunch, or \ndinner  .  People have different meanings for these \nwords and you also may miss the foods eaten in \nbetween meal times  .  \nn B e gentle and kind  .  Food intake is very personal \ninformation and negative comments or gestures \nmay decrease the accuracy of the dietary recall  .  \nn S ome people eat in the middle of the night; ask the \nwoman if she ate anything after she went to sleep\nn R ecord any vitamins, minerals, and other nutrition \nsupplements such as protein powder, fish oils, \nherbs, etc  .Step 1 Questions:\nn Health y eating is important for you and your \nbaby  .

Add these foods to the recall  .\nKey Points:\nn Easy t o forget foods like butter, half and half, \nmayonnaise, salad dressings, fats used in cooking, and \nsnacks may contain many calories and few nutrients  . \nn Check t o see that all beverages are recorded, \nincluding sodas, coffee, teas, juices, and any type \nof water-based beverage  .\nStep 2 Questions:\nn Did y ou have any snacks yesterday? \nn What be verage did you drink with this meal? \nn D o you use cream or sugar in your drink? \nn Did y ou spread anything on your bread, biscuit, or \nmuffin? \nn Did y ou add butter or margarine to the potato or \nvegetables you ate? \nn Did y ou add anything to give your food flavor or \ntaste better?\nn Did y ou eat tortillas, pieces of bread, or rolls with \nyour meal?\nStep 3: Time and Occasion\nIt is helpful to ask the woman what time she ate the food to learn more about her food habits and to help \nher remember other foods she ate  .  Record times of \nfood eaten in the \u201cTime\u201d column  .NUTR  |  31\nSTEPS TO TAKENUTRITIONCompleting a CPSP Nutrition  Dietary Assessment\nStep 3 Questions:\nn What time did y ou eat this meal? \nn When did y ou eat next? \nn W as there a special occasion on this day?\nStep 4: Detailed Description of Food \nEaten\nTo assess if all the food groups were eaten in the \namount needed, you will need to compare the types \nand amounts of food eaten to MyPlate for Moms  .  The \namounts in MyPlate are described using household measures of cups (fruits, vegetables, and dairy foods), \nounces (protein foods and grains) and teaspoons (oils)  . \nIt is important to determine the amount eaten of \neach food group  .  Use food models and pictures, \nmeasuring cups and spoons, dinner plates and bowls \nto help assess the amount of each food item eaten  . \nWrite the amount she ate for each food item in the \n\u201cHow Much\u201d column of the dietary recall  .\nStep 4 Questions:\nn Did y ou bake, broil, boil or fry the chicken you ate? \nn Ho w did you flavor the broccoli you ate? \nn Ho w much oil did you use to fry the potatoes? \nn Ho w much butter did you add for each pancake?\nn Which of these measur ing spoons or cups best \ndescribes the amount of gravy, salad dressing, \nsour cream, etc  .  you ate?\nCheck for added fat  .

Whatever the dietary assessment \nmethod used, it is most important that the woman \nmakes healthy food selections  .  The  Perinatal Food \nGroup Recall asks questions about a woman\u2019s usual \ndaily intake; it does not ask about her specific intake \nfor one day  .

When lactose is not digested, it is not \nabsorbed by the body and remains in the intestine \nwhere it can cause gas  .  Intolerance means a lack \nof ability to digest lactose properly; it is not a food \nallergy  .  Clients may confuse lactose intolerance with a \nmilk allergy  .  True milk allergy is very rare in adults  .\nThe most common form of lactose intolerance develops \nover time as the body produces less and less lactase  . \nPeople can become lactase deficient after injury to the \nsmall intestine or through digestive diseases like celiac \ndisease, inflammatory bowel disease, and Crohn\u2019s disease  .\nSigns of lactose intolerance include bloating, nausea, \ncramps, diarrhea, and gas  .  Symptoms begin within 30 \nminutes to 2 hours after eating or drinking food containing \nlactose  .  The ethnic groups most affected in adulthood \nare African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and \nAsians  .  The condition is least common among people of \nnorthern European descent  . No treatment can improve \nthe body\u2019s ability to make lactase, but symptoms can \nbe controlled through diet  . People vary in the amount \nof lactose they can handle  .  Some people can tolerate \ndrinking 1 cup of milk and others may tolerate hard cheese \nbut feel discomfort when drinking milk  .\nDairy foods provide calcium, vitamin D and other important nutrients for a healthy pregnancy and long-\nterm health  . Most women can successfully incorporate \ndairy products into their diet using the strategies \noutlined under \u201cSteps to Take\u201d below  .  Women need \nto be informed that lactose intolerance does not \nmean they must totally avoid milk or dairy products  .  \nBy gradually eating more foods containing lactose, the total amount of lactose that can be comfortably \ntolerated increases  .  Research indicates that up to 2 \ncups of milk per day can be consumed if taken with \nmeals and spread throughout the day  .If a client reacts to even small amounts of lactose, an \nover-the-counter lactase enzyme is available in tablet \nor liquid form  . The WIC program offers lactose-free \nmilk that contains the same nutrients found in regular milk and other non-dairy calcium rich foods such as \ntofu, soy and rice milk, calcium fortified juices, sardines \nand salmon with soft edible bones, dried beans, and \ndark green vegetables  .\nSteps to Take\nUse these questions and interventions to assess and counsel your client:\nDoes she experience gas, bloating, or diarrhea after \ndrinking milk or eating yogurt, cheese, ice cream, or other dairy foods?\nn Ha ve her try drinking only 4-ounce portions at one \ntime and warming the milk\nn Whole , 2% milk or chocolate milk may be better \ntolerated than lower fat, unflavored milk\nn I f she is on WIC, recommend she get low lactose milk \nor calcium-fortified rice or soy milk, and hard cheeses\nn Y ogurts with \u201clive, active cultures\u201d and other fermented \ndairy foods like kefir, buttermilk, and sweet acidophilus milk are more easily tolerated than milk\nn A ged cheeses such as cheddar, colby, swiss, and \nparmesan are lower in lactose\nn R efer her to the health care provider to prescribe \nthe lactase enzyme\nCan she eat a small portion of these foods without \nexperiencing the problem?\nn Star t with a small amount of milk (1/4 to 1/2 cup) \nat meals or as snacks several times a day\nn Spr ead out the amounts of these foods over three \nmeals and two or more snacks daily\nCan she eat foods cooked with milk or drink warmed milk?\nn Suggest using milk t o make soups, puddings, \ncustards, or hot milk drinksNUTR  |  68\nSTEPS TO TAKENUTRITIONLactose Intolerance\nn W arm milk and add a dash of vanilla to improve \nthe taste\nWhat are her cultural or religious food preferences? \nDo they affect her food intake?\nn L earn about her religious and cultural beliefs  .

Anemia is a condition in \nwhich the body does not produce enough healthy red blood cells to provide oxygen to the tissues of the \nbody  .  Anemia is more common during pregnancy \ndue to increased blood volume and growth of the \nfetus and other maternal tissue  .  Iron deficiency is \nthe most common cause of anemia in pregnancy  .  \nAnemia is a late stage of iron deficiency  .  It is \nestimated that 50% of women do not have adequate \niron stores for pregnancy  .  Vitamin deficiencies of folic \nacid and B12 can result in a less common anemia \nknown as megaloblastic anemia  . \nWhy Iron Deficiency Matters\nIron deficiency is one of the most common \nnutritional deficiencies worldwide  .  Iron deficiency \nranges from depletion of iron stores to iron deficiency \nanemia  . Maternal anemia increases the risk of \npremature birth and low birth weight  . Some studies \nreport lower iron stores and poorer health among \ninfants born to iron deficient mothers  .  These risks are \ngreater if the client enters pregnancy anemic and \nis anemic during the first two trimesters  .  Women \nanemic early in pregnancy are also more likely to \nhave inadequate weight gain  . Anemia may put the \nmother at risk if excessive blood is lost during delivery \nand postpartum  . Postpartum women often have \ndepleted iron stores and may become anemic due to \nblood loss during delivery  .  \nSigns of anemiaSigns of anemia include paleness, fatigue, dizziness, \nheadache, shortness of breath, and chronic infections  .  \nAnemia and iron deficiency can affect the client\u2019s quality of life and her ability to cope with the stresses \nof pregnancy and a new infant  . Biochemical assessment of anemia\nMeasuring hemoglobin is a common screening method \nfor iron deficiency anemia  . Iron is required to make \nhemoglobin, the protein in the red blood cell that carries \noxygen from the lungs to the body tissues  .  The provider \nmay order other tests (such as serum ferritin) to measure iron storage and to rule out anemia from other causes\nWho is most at risk for anemia?\nIron deficiency anemia is common during pregnancy  .  \nWomen who are poor, African American, or have \nrecently immigrated from a developing country have \nhigher rates of anemia  . Women may enter pregnancy \nwith low iron stores due to:\nn Hea vy blood loss during menstruation\nn L ow energy due to poor diet, quality, and variety\nn H igh intake of processed food\nn V egan diet or low protein diet\nn H igh parity\nn Shor t pregnancy interval\nn Gr owth demands of adolescence\nn P regnant with multiples\nn F requent infections or chronic disease\nn I ntense exercise, especially distance running \nEven women entering pregnancy with adequate iron stores often become iron deficient later in their \npregnancy  .  All pregnant women should be advised to \neach iron rich food and to take a supplement of iron and \nfolic acid  .  Follow your clinic\u2019s protocol for assessment \nof anemia and supplement recommendations  .  See \nPrenatal Supplements \u2013 Vitamins and Minerals for \nguidelines on iron and folic acid supplementation  .NUTR  |  76\nSTEPS TO TAKENUTRITIONIron Deficiency and Other Anemias\nDietary Iron\nAlthough iron absorption increases during pregnancy, \nthe amount of iron needed during pregnancy is not \neasy to obtain by diet alone  .  The average diet contains \nonly 10 to15 mg per day and 27 mg a day is needed \nduring pregnancy  .  The two forms of dietary iron are \nheme and non-heme  .  \nImportant facts about dietary iron\nn Heme ir on is well absorbed and found only in \nmeat, poultry and fish  . \nn Non-heme ir on is less well absorbed and found \nin foods such as dried beans, peas, iron fortified cereals, bread and pasta, dark green leafy \nvegetables, dried fruits, nuts, and seeds  .\nn M ost food sources of iron come from non-heme \nsources, so increasing iron absorption is very \nimportant  .\nn Heme ir on (from animal sources) and vitamin C \nrich foods enhance non-heme iron absorption  .\nn C ooking in cast iron cookware can increase iron in \nfoods  .\nn C offee, tea, and soda can decrease iron absorption  . \nn M ilk, dairy products, or calcium supplements can \ndecrease the amount of iron absorbed at a meal  .  \nSteps to Take\nUse these questions and interventions to assess \nand counsel the client to eat iron rich foods  .

The eating of clay or dirt is a form of \npica called geophagia  . Dirt, clay, cornstarch, and ice \ncubes are the most commonly craved items  .  Women \nmay also eat store-bought substances such as \nmagnesium carbonate  .

Women need to follow safe food \nhandling and preparation practices in their homes to avoid \nharmful bacteria, viruses, parasites, mold, and other toxins  .\nThe outcome of a foodborne illness can be severe or \neven fatal  .  Pregnant women and their unborn children \nare more susceptible to foodborne infection, especially \nto listeriosis, salmonellosis, and toxoplasmosis  .  Most \nfoodborne infections are the result of improper food \nhandling and preparation  . Extra caution is needed \nduring pregnancy  .  The resources provided below offer \nclear facts on many food safety topics  . \nThree Primary Foodborne Risks\nListeriosis is a rare foodborne illness caused by the consumption of foods contaminated with the Listeria \nmonocytogenes bacterium  . The bacterium is found in \nsoil and water  .  It may be spead by vegetables, meats, \nand dairy products, especially unpasteurized milk or \nfoods made from unapsteurized milk  .  Mothers can \ncontaminate their infant while pregnant  . Infected infants \ncan suffer mental retardation, blindness, paralysis, or \ndeath  . Hispanic women have higher listeriosis infection \nrates and this is most likely due to a higher consumption \nof unpasteurized soft cheeses  .  Unlike most bacteria, \nlisteria can live in refrigerated temperatures  . \nToxoplasmosis is caused by a parasite found in raw and undercooked meat, unwashed fruits and \nvegetables, contaminated water, dust, soil, cat boxes, \nand any cat feces  .  Eating or handling undercooked \nmeat, especially pork, lamb, or venison is a risk  .  \nTouching the mouth after handling cat litter or soil \ncontaminated with cat feces can cause infection  . \nToxoplasmosis can result in hearing loss, cognitive \ndisabilities, blindness, and death  . Women considering \npregnancy should take all precautions to prevent this \ninfection prior to and during pregnancy  .Methylmercury  is a toxic metal that is especially high \nin large fish such as shark, tilefish, king mackerel, and \nswordfish  . High levels of mercury are harmful for the \ndeveloping fetal nervous system  . However, eating fish \nis recommended as part of a healthy diet and most \nAmericans eat far less fish than the recommended \n12 ounces per week  .  The omega-3 fatty acids, \neicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and decosahexaenoic (DHA) in fish have many reported health benefits for women \nand improved outcomes in infants such as cognitive and \nvisual development  . Evidence shows that the benefits of \neating a variety of fish outweigh the risk of methylmercury, \na heavy metal found in varying amounts in fish  . \nOther chemicals in fish\nFish may contain other chemicals harmful to the fetus  .  \nCheck local advisories to learn about the safety of \nthe fish caught in local lakes, rivers, and coastal areas  .  \nAdvisories recommend the type, size, and amount \nof fish safe to eat for pregnant and lactating women \nand their children  . In general, eating smaller, non-\npredatory fish from a variety of locations is best in \nsmall serving sizes (3 to 4 ounces)  . If there is no advice \navailable, limit consumption to 6 ounces per week of smaller fish from local waters and don\u2019t eat other fish \nduring that week  .  See the Office of Environmental \nHealth Hazard Assessment for Safe Eating Guidelines, an Advisory Map, and General Advice to reduce \nexposure to chemicals in sport fish  .\nOther foodborne infectionsProper food handling, preparation, and storage will \nkeep most food safe  .  Women should take the same \nprecautions when eating out as eating at home  .  To \navoid food infection, advise the client to follow the NUTR  |  128\nSTEPS TO TAKENUTRITIONFood Safety\nfour basic food safety principles: clean, separate, \ncook, and chill  .

Explain that the color of \nthe meat or clear juices are not indicators of a safe \ncooking temperature  .\nn P rovide information on safe minimal \ntemperatures for cooking, cooling, and freezing  .  \nn A sk which foods she keeps out at room \ntemperature  .  Advise her to throw away prepared \nfood, meats, and dairy products that have been \nleft out more than two hours  .  Check to make \nsure she defrosts meat and other foods in the \nrefrigerator, not on the counter  .\nn A sk if she washes produce before putting it away \nin the refrigerator  .  This is especially important for \nmelons  .Avoiding listeriosis and other foodborne \nillnesses \nAsk if the client is following these safe food practices:\nn C onsumes only pasteurized milk and foods \nmade from pasteurized milk; raw milk and unpasteurized soft cheeses (feta, queso blanco, \nqueso fresco, Brie, Camembert, blue-veined \ncheeses, and panela) are not safe\nn Dr inks juice that is frozen, canned, or pasteurized\nn Heats deli and luncheon meats , such as bologna, \ncold cuts, and hotdogs to steaming hot to kill listeria\nn Only eats saf e canned pat\u00e9s and fish-based \nproducts and avoids unsafe foods:\nu R efrigerated pat\u00e9s or meat spreads\nu R efrigerated smoked seafood such as lox or \nother smoked, dried, cured, or kippered fish, unless it is in a cooked dish like a casserole\nn D oesn\u2019t eat any bean, alfalfa, mung, or other raw \nsprouts  .  \nAvoiding toxoplasmosis\nn Is the client f ollowing safe food handling and \npreparation practices? Advise her to wash all produce, cook meat to a safe internal \ntemperature, and always keep raw meat separate \nfrom other foods  .\nn O ther precautions include washing hands \nafter touching soil, sand, raw meat, cat litter, or \nunwashed vegetables  .\nn D oes she have a cat?

It is under revision  . \nIt states that a well planned vegetarian diet is appropriate for individuals during all life stages, \nincluding pregnancy and lactation  . Studies support \nthat a vegetarian diet can be nutritionally adequate in pregnancy and lactation and result in positive \nmaternal and infant health outcomes  .  Supplements or \nfortified foods may be needed to support the needs of some pregnant and lactating vegetarians because \nsome vegetarian diets are more restrictive than others  .\nIt is always important to find out what a client \nmeans when she states she is vegetarian  . Some \npeople decide to move in the direction of becoming vegetarian by eliminating certain flesh foods and \ncontinuing to eat others, such as chicken and/or fish  . \nAlthough a small percentage of pregnant women are vegetarian, the number of women leaning toward \nvegetarian eating habits is increasing  .\nCommon Vegetarian Terms\nThe wide variability of dietary practices among vegetarians makes individual assessment of dietary \nadequacy essential  .  Lacto-ovo vegetarian and \nvegan are two common terms used to describe \nvegetarian eating  .\nThe term lacto-ovo vegetarian refers to people who eat dairy products (lacto) and eggs (ovo) but avoid \nall animal flesh such as beef, chicken, lamb, pork, fish, \nand shellfish  . People may choose to eat both dairy products and eggs or limit one and not the other  .\nVegans, or total vegetarians, avoid all foods of animal \norigin, including all animals, birds, fish, eggs, and dairy \nfoods  .  Of the people who call themselves vegetarian, \n30 to 40% of them follow a vegan diet  . Some vegans \nalso stop using all products that contain animal products, including leather, soaps made from animal \nfat, and products that have gelatin, such as Jell-O\u00ae \nand marshmallows  .\nThe registered dietitian plays a key role in educating \nvegetarian clients about the sources of specific \nnutrients, food purchasing and preparation, dietary \nmodifications, and supplements to meet needs \nduring pregnancy, lactation, and postpartum  .\nWhen a lacto-ovo vegetarian\u2019s calorie intake is \nadequate, protein intake is usually also adequate  .  \nMost lacto-ovo vegetarians can follow the MyPlate for Moms recommendations and substitute plant \nprotein sources for animal proteins and calcium and \nvitamin D fortified soy or rice milk for dairy products  .\nMany other vegetarian eating patterns exist; some \npeople restrict their diet to fruit, others only eat food \nthat can be eaten uncooked  .  Any severe dietary \nrestriction requires a referral to the registered dietitian  .\nSpecial Concerns for Pregnancy\nPregnant and breastfeeding vegetarians can get all the nutrients and calories they need and have a \nhealthy, thriving baby  .  Avoiding meat does not put \na woman at nutritional risk as long as she consumes adequate calories, protein, calcium, iron, vitamin \nB12, vitamin D, zinc and other nutrients from food \nsources, fortified foods, and/or supplements  .  Most \nlacto-ovo vegetarians can use MyPlate for Moms by NUTR  |  142\nSTEPS TO TAKENUTRITIONVegetarian Eating\nselecting plant-based proteins listed in the meat \nand beans group  .  Pregnant and lactating vegans \nmay need education and support to get nutrients \neasily obtained in meat and dairy foods, particularly \ncalcium, vitamin B12, iron, and possibly essential fats  .  \nAdditional supplemental iron is recommended for \nall pregnant women  . It is important to respect the \nclient\u2019s food choices and provide support, education, \nand referrals to the registered dietitian as needed  .\nProtein\nThe client can easily consume the additional 25 grams of protein that is needed during pregnancy \nby eating plant protein to meet her energy needs  .  \nHigh plant protein foods include beans, tofu (made from soy beans), lentils, peanut butter, and all nuts \nand seeds, including milk made from soy beans, rice, \nand nuts  .  Wheat, rice, barley, and oats contain protein \nand protein is also present in lesser amounts in \nvegetables  .  Adding dairy products and/or eggs to the \ndiet makes it easier to obtain adequate protein but \nit is not essential to meeting protein requirements  .  \nMany women get the extra protein they need by \neating more of the protein rich foods they usually eat  . \nFor example, adding 1\u00bd cups of beans, lentils, or tofu, \nor 2\u00bd cups of soy milk or two large bagels provides \n25 grams of additional protein to support pregnancy  .  \nIt important to eat several servings of a variety of \nbeans, grains, nuts, and seeds each day  .\nIt was once believed that plant proteins needed to be combined, or eaten together at each meal to benefit \nthe body  .  This is no longer believed to be true, but \nit is important for the vegetarian client to eat a wide variety of plant-based proteins and to consume an \nadequate amount each day  .  \nVitamins and Minerals: Calcium, B12, \nVitamin D, and Iron\nWomen who do not eat meat, poultry, fish, eggs, or \ndairy products require careful dietary assessment \nand planning  .  If the woman chooses not to include dairy products, refer her to her medical provider and registered dietitian to discuss calcium foods \nand supplement sources, and to assess her B12 and \nvitamin D intake  .  Some vegetarian women may need \nsupplemental vitamin D if they have a low intake of \nvitamin D fortified foods and limited sun exposure  .\nIron from plant foods is not as well absorbed by the \nbody as iron from animal foods so vegetarians need \nto eat more iron-rich food than non-vegetarians  .  A \ngood source of vitamin C increases iron absorption \nfrom beans, green vegetables and grains  .  (See \nPrenatal Vitamins and Minerals, Iron, and Calcium in \nthe \u201cNutrition\u201d guidelines)  . Vitamin B12 is another \nconcern as meat, dairy, and eggs offer the only \nreliable source of this vitamin  . Nutrients limited by a \nvegan diet are not addressed here as they require the \nskills of a registered dietitian  . \nTeenage Vegetarians\nA pregnant or breastfeeding teenager with lacto-ovo vegetarian habits can meet the protein and \niron requirements with careful planning and \nsupplementation  . Teen lifestyle and eating habits \nmay make obtaining an adequate vegetarian or \nvegan diet difficult  . Referral to the registered dietitian \nis highly recommended to assess caloric and nutrient \nadequacy of vegetarian teenagers  .\nSteps to Take\nDetermine if the client eats eggs and/or dairy foods \nand the amount eaten  . Refer vegans or people with \nother restrictive food habits to a registered dietitian \nfor assessment, education, and meal planning  .  Follow \nthe following steps for lacto-ovo vegetarians:\nn A ssess the overall quality of food intake and \ndo not assume vegetarians eat a healthy diet  . \nComplete a 24-Hour Dietary Recall and compare \nyour findings with MyPlate for Moms  . Assist the \nclient in making any needed changes in her food \nchoices  .NUTR  |  143\nSTEPS TO TAKENUTRITIONVegetarian Eating\nn D etermine the client\u2019s eating frequency  .  It is \nimportant for all pregnant women to eat every \nthree to four hours throughout the day  .  Advise \nvegetarian women to include foods high in \nplant protein for each meal and snacks  .  See the \nhandout When You Are a Vegetarian: What You \nNeed to Know  .\nn A ssess nutrient supplement use  .  Lacto-\novo vegetarians may follow the same recommendations for prenatal vitamin and \nmineral use as non-vegetarians; no other \nsupplements should be necessary unless she \ndoes not consume an adequate diet  .\nn A ssess the pregnant client\u2019s rate of weight gain \nby plotting it on the weight gain grid  .

The American \nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP) states that all infant milk \nformulas \u201cdiffer markedly\u201d from human milk  .  The AAP \nrecommends exclusive breastfeeding (feeding only breast milk) for the first six months and continued \nbreastfeeding for at least one year as normal infant \nfeeding  .  Appropriate complementary foods may be \nadded slowly after six months  .  Infant formula or any \nother food cannot replace human milk, nor provide \nthe infant with the same protection from illness  .  \nBreastfeeding benefits are understood by most \nwomen  . The risk of not breastfeeding for infants and \nfor women is less well understood  .  Infants who are not \nbreastfed risk increased illness and infection in early life \nand increased risk of developing a number of health \nproblems in later life  .  When mothers do not breastfeed \nthey are at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer, \ntype 2 diabetes, and postpartum depression  . \nMost Women in California Choose \nBreastfeeding\nThe majority of women in California want to \nbreastfeed but many do not get the help and \nsupport they need to continue breastfeeding  .  \nWomen report that barriers such as returning to work, embarrassment, and lack of support make it \ndifficult to continue breastfeeding  .\nThe rates of breastfeeding in California are measured \nin different ways  .  The Newborn Screening (NBS) \nprogram collects in-hospital feeding practices and reports on how many mothers are breastfeeding \nexclusively or partially breastfeeding (giving some \nbreast milk)  . Efforts to increase breastfeeding rates are \npaying off  .  Nine out of ten newborns received some \nbreast milk  .  Only half of the breastfed newborns \nreceived only breast milk; half of breastfed newborns \nreceived formula  . Mothers who do not exclusively breastfeed in the \nhospital are less successful breastfeeding at home  .  \nMothers who are African-American, Hispanic, have \nless education, and lower income tend to not \nbreastfeed exclusively  .  Teenaged mothers breastfeed \nless than non-teen mothers across all ethnic and \nracial groups  .  Teens can breastfeed if given the help \nthey need to face barriers at home, school, or work  .  \nCalifornia breastfeeding rates are higher than many states but fall short of the Healthy People 2020 goals \nfor the nation: \nwww  . healthypeople  . gov\nBreastfeeding Influences and the \nNeed for Support\nWomen need help learning to breastfeed and need \nsupport to continue breastfeeding  .  Women are strongly \ninfluenced by their families and communities  .  If mothers, \nsisters, and friends did not breastfeed, many mothers have \nno one to turn to for support and correct information  . \nWomen who start breastfeeding can face social and \ncultural barriers that prevent them from breastfeeding \nas long and as exclusively as planned  .  CPSP services \nshould include breastfeeding education, encouragement, support, and referrals during pregnancy and in the early \npostpartum period  .  WIC, La Leche League, lactation \nexperts, and local breastfeeding coalitions also help \nwomen start and sustain breastfeeding  .\n\u201cBaby Friendly\u201d Practices\nMany studies show that women are more likely to breastfeed when they deliver in hospitals that have \n\u201cbaby friendly\u201d practices  .

Producing \nenough breast milk is a common worry; it is \nnot a common problem  . A woman needs to \nknow that the more often and effectively she \nbreastfeeds, the more milk she will make  .  This \nis especially important during the first two \nweeks after delivery  .\nu How milk production works. Every time \nthe baby breastfeeds and drains the breast, \nhormones are released that signal the \nmother\u2019s body to make more milk  .  When \nmost of the milk is removed from the breast, \nespecially by the baby, more milk is made  .  \nWhen babies are given any bottles, even \nbottled breast milk, the breasts make less \nmilk  .  Feeding with bottles prevents the baby \nfrom signaling the woman\u2019s body to make \nmore milk  .  A mother can trust the baby to \nbreastfeed when the baby is hungry and stop \nwhen satisfied  .  Timed or scheduled feedings \nare not recommended  .\nu Breast or nipple size does not matter.  \nWomen with any size breast can make enough \nmilk, even for twins or triplets  .

Colostrum \nis the perfect first food for all \nnewborns  .  Do not discard \nit . If the baby is not able to \nbreastfeed, hand express \ncolostrum to a small clean \nspoon and feed it to the baby \nby spoon or syringe  .The infant will be awake and \nalert in the first hour  .  This is \nthe best time to start learning \nhow to breastfeed  .  The infant\u2019s \nstomach at birthi can hold only \nabout as much as what fits in a \nmarble  .  It is a \u201cgetting to know \nyou\u201d time when baby adapts to \nthe world and looks for mother\u2019s \nface, hears her voice and adjusts \nto the new environment  . Place \nbaby on the mother\u2019s chest \nto warm up and hear familiar \nsounds  .  This releases normal \nseeking behavior leading to the \nfirst breastfeeding  .iiMother is tired after birth but ready to touch and talk to \nher baby  .  This is the perfect \ntime to make her comfortable as she recovers and help \nher cuddle with and warm \nher baby skin-to-skin  . This \nis important bonding time  .  \nWhen baby shows \u201cready \nto eat\u201d behaviors (cues) the \nmother can breastfeed often, \ngiving mother and baby many opportunities to learn new \nbreastfeeding skills  .\nFirst 12 to 24 hoursThe infant will drink 1 teaspoon \nof colostrum at each feeding  . \nWomen may not see the milk, but it has what the infant needs \nand in the right amount  . Baby \nshows cues when ready to eat: licking the lips, reaching to \nthe mother or breast, sucking \nhands or fingers  .\nThe baby\u2019s stool reflects the \nchanges in breast milk  .  Stools \nstarts out dark, almost black, \nand become lighter  .  \nIf baby cannot be brought to \nmother to breastfeed, hand \nexpression with pumping \nshould be taught so that baby can be given mothers\u2019 milk as \nsoon as the baby can feedIt is normal for infants to sleep \nheavily shortly after birth  . Some \ninfants may be too tired to latch \non well at first  . Expect frequent \nfeedings  .  Babies have strong \ninstincts to suck and feed every \none to two hours and sleep after \nfeedings  .  Some infants, especially \nif they are not full-term, will be tired and the mother may have \nto wake them up to breastfeed \nif they sleep more than three \nhours  .  Mothers should ask the \nhospital staff not to give her baby any formula, water, or pacifiers \nunless needed for medical \nreasons, because at this age, babies usually breastfeed due \nto sucking needs rather than \nhunger  .  If pacifiers are used to \nsoothe babies, they may skip \nbreastfeedings and not stimulate \nneeded milk production  .Mother needs quiet time to rest during the short \ntimes between feedings \nand time to bond with her \nbaby  .  Mothers may want to \nlimit visitors  .  Nipples may be \ntender, but should not hurt  . \nIf breastfeeding hurts, she should ask for breastfeeding \nhelp  .  A semi-reclined position, \nwith the baby on top of the women helps the infant latch \non to the breast  . Women \nwith a C-section may need extra help positioning baby \nfor feeding, but they can \nbreastfeed even if they are \ntaking medication for pain  . If \nthere is concern, consult the \nbaby\u2019s health care provider  .NUTR  |  172\nSTEPS TO TAKENUTRITIONWhat to Expect while Breastfeeding:  Birth to Six Weeks\nMilk The Infant The Mother\nDays 2 to 5 The milk now has more water, so \nit will look bluish-white, but may \nstill have a yellowish appearance \nfor about two weeks  .  The milk \nthe woman makes is just right \nfor her baby  .\nMany mothers do not leak milk  . \nThis is not a sign of how much \nmilk mother makes  .\nBy day three the stool should be \nlighter (more yellow) in color  .The infant will feed often, 10 or \nmore times in 24 hours  .  The more \na baby breastfeeds, the more milk \na mother makes  .iii The infant\u2019s \nstomach is slowly growing to the \nsize of baby\u2019s fist  . All infants do \nnot eat on a schedule or know \nday from night  . It is normal for \nbreastfeeding infants to feed \nevery one to two hours for a \nwhile, followed by a longer sleep  . \nFeedings will probably take \nabout 30 minutes  .  It is best not \nto remove the baby from the first \nbreast until they let go  .  Some \nbabies take only one side at a \nfeeding  .  If they nurse on one side \nonly, start on the other side at the \nnext feeding  .  After delivery, it is \nnormal for an infant to lose some \nweight  . By about 10 days to 2 \nweeks of age the baby should be \nback to birth weight  . The baby \nshould be seen by the health care provider at least once by \ntwo days after discharge  .Between days two to four the mother\u2019s breasts will begin to \nfeel full and may leak  .  Insert \npads inside the bra to absorb \nmilk  .  She usually makes more \nmilk than her baby needs  . \nFrequent breastfeeding can help reduce swollen and \nhard breasts (engorgement)  . \nBetween feedings, ice packs can reduce swelling, which \ngoes away in one to two days  . \nIf breastfeeding becomes difficult, the mother should \ncall for assistance  .  Day or night, \nmothers need to rest when \nbaby sleeps  .  Family and friends \nshould help her and allow her \ntime to rest and recover  . \nIf she has pain in her nipples or worries about her milk supply, \nshe can contact WIC, her \nhealth care provider, a lactation consultant, the delivery hospital, \nor other breastfeeding resources  .NUTR  |  173\nSTEPS TO TAKENUTRITIONWhat to Expect while Breastfeeding:  Birth to Six Weeks\nMilk The Infant The Mother\nDay 6 to  \n4 weeksMilk transitions from colostrum to transitional milk to mature \nmilk  .  Changes will usually not \nbe noticed by either mother or baby, but these changes \nperfectly meet the baby\u2019s \nneeds at this time  .  \nSetting aside six diapers every \nmorning reassures her that \nher baby has taken enough \nmilk if she has used them all up in 24 hours At 6 to 8 \nweeks, the baby may not have \nas many dirty diapers; this is \nnormal  .  He/She will still have \nat least 5 wet diapers per day  .  \n(see WIC handout https://\nwww  . cdph  . ca  . gov/Programs/\nCFH/DWICSN/CDPH%20\nDocument%20Library/Families/FeedingMyBaby/\nGuide-to-Breastfeeding  . pdf) .\nBy day six the stool should be \nsoft and thicker yellow looking \nor have a \u201ccottage cheese\u201d like \nlook  .  It is normal for all infants \nto have irregular feeding \nand sleeping schedules  .  \nBreastfeeding babies feed frequently to meet their \ngrowth needs  .  Frequent \nfeedings increase the \nmother\u2019s milk supply  .  The \nbaby is learning to feed more efficiently and the mother\u2019s \nmilk production is adjusting \nto the needs of the baby  .  \nSetting a feeding schedule or \nlimiting feedings can decrease \nbaby\u2019s growth and reduce \nmother\u2019s milk supply  .  Teach \nmothers to respond to their \nbaby\u2019s cues and to enjoy \ntheir baby\u2019s communication \nskills  .  See Resources for baby \ncues  .  Reinforce that frequent, \nirregular feeding patterns are \nnormal  .  Mothers need help \nanticipating and preparing for \nher baby\u2019s frequent feeding \nneeds during this time  .  \nMothers need to know that as breastfeeding infants grow \nthey will breastfeed fewer \ntimes per day and night  .The mother may feel down \none moment and frustrated \nthe next  . This is normal and \noften called \u201cbaby blues\u201d  .  She \nshould expect to feel better in \nabout two weeks  .  She should \nreach out for help and accept \nit . Family and friends can bring \nfood for her, and help with the housework, but let the mother \nand baby learn how to be with \neach other rather than taking \nthe baby away  . \nThe mother\u2019s body will adjust to making the right amount of \nmilk .  If she is worried, she should \ncall WIC and CPSP for help  .NUTR  |  174\nSTEPS TO TAKENUTRITIONWhat to Expect while Breastfeeding:  Birth to Six Weeks\nMilk The Infant The Mother\nFirst 4 to 6 \nweeksMost mothers never see their \nmilk .  If she expresses her \nmilk, she may see that it looks bluish-white at the beginning \nof a feeding and creamy white \ntowards the end  .  Milk may \nchange color and flavor after the \nmother eats certain foods  .  This is \nnormal and helps the baby get \nused to the family\u2019s diet  .The infant is more efficient at \nbreastfeeding and may take \nless time on each breast  . The \ninfant has a larger stomach capacity and is able to take \nmore milk  .  Feedings may be \nfarther apart  . At around 10 \ndays and 6 weeks, infants will breastfeed more frequently \n(called \u201cgrowth spurts\u201d)  . \nBreastfeeding is not just for food \u2013 it also meets many of \nbaby\u2019s needs, such as security, \nwarmth, and closeness  .

The guidelines are intended to provide \nthe CPSP practitioner with the tools needed to discuss these topics with clients and make \nappropriate referrals  .  Complex or high-risk conditions \nrequire the expertise of a mental health professional.\nAssessment\nThe initial assessment will help you identify social, emotional, and economic issues and needs that \naffect the woman and her pregnancy  .  From \nthe assessment you can help her develop an \nIndividualized Care Plan to deal with these problems  .  \nYou will also help her identify her own strengths so she can trust her ability to find and carry out \nsolutions  .\nAssessment Guidelines\nComplete an initial psychosocial assessment on every client within four weeks of entry into care. \nIf the client declines the assessment, document the \nrefusal in the chart  . Offer reassessments at least once \nevery trimester and at the postpartum visit \nHigh-risk clients may need more intervention and \nmay be seen more frequently  .\nFor high-risk clients, see information on the following \npage  .See the CPSP Provider Handbook for \na description of required psychosocial \nassessment components, components \nof basic psychosocial care, complex \npsychosocial conditions warranting specialized care, and required CPSP psychosocial personnel.PSY  |  6\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALHigh-R isk Situations\neek help from your supervisor in any \ncase where you think someone has \nbeen harmed or is in danger of being \nharmed. If a supervisor is not immediately available, consult with the health care provider responsible for \nthe client\u2019s care  .  In emergency and life-threatening \nsituations, call 911 for help  .\nGet help before the client leaves the office  .  You don\u2019t \nhave to be sure that the situation is dangerous  .\nWhen in doubt, check it out.\nSome dangerous situations are:\nn S omeone may be thinking of hurting or killing \nthemselves\nn S omeone may be thinking of hurting or killing \nsomeone else\nn S omeone may be a victim of physical or sexual \nassault\nn S omeone may be pregnant as a result of rape, \ndate rape, or birth control sabotage\nn S omeone may have a mental problem that makes \nthem unable to care for themselves or puts them \nin danger\nn A child ma y be a victim of abuse or neglect\nn An elder or dependent adult ma y be a victim of \nabuse or neglect\nEach site will have different ways of handling these \nsituations  .  Be sure there are written procedures on \nhow your site deals with high-risk cases  .  All staff \nshould be trained on how to follow the procedures \nbefore the possible crisis  .In this section you will find guidelines with suggestions for how to deal with the following high-\nrisk situations:\nn emotional or mental health concerns\nn depression\nn child abuse and neglect\nn spousal/intimat e partner abuse\nn perinatal substanc e use/abusePSY  |  7\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALUnwanted Pregnancy\nBackground\nf the pregnancy is unplanned or \nunwanted, the client may have many \nmixed feelings  .  Her decision to attend \nthis appointment does not mean she has decided to \nfollow through with her pregnancy  .  If she indicates \nshe is unsure about her pregnancy, she may be \nstruggling with her options  .  You can help a woman in \nthis situation by outlining all the options available to \nher . The main options are:\nn Ha ving a therapeutic abortion (TAB), depending \non the gestational age\nn P lacing the child for adoption\nn R aising the child\nFor Teens Under 18 Years\nA minor, age12 or older can receive pregnancy-related care (including abortion) without her parents\u2019 \npermission, as long as she seems capable of giving \nan informed consent  . This will be determined by the \nhealth care provider (doctor or midwife)  .\nA pregnant minor is eligible for a special kind of \nMedi-Cal called \u201csensitive services\u201d or \u201cminor consent \nservices  .\u201d  Medi-Cal may not contact the parents \nand the parents\u2019 income is not considered in \ndetermining eligibility; only the teen\u2019s own income \nis counted  .  Parents are not responsible for payment if the minor seeks and receives services on her own, \nunder this type of Medi-Cal  .\nSteps to Take\nExplore Choices\nThe client may want to discuss what makes her \npregnancy unwanted  .  Reasons may include her:\nn F inancial situation\nn C areer, job, or educational plans\nn R elationship with baby\u2019s father or her partner\nn P regnancy is the result of rape\nn R eproductive coercion (putting pressure on \na woman to get pregnant against her wishes, \nwhich may or may not include birth control \nsabotage)\nn Lack of a suppor t system\nn O ther family issues (such as other small children \nat home or disapproval of extended family)\nn A ge (perceived as either too young or too old)\nn M edical problems (either known or feared)\nn Substance use\nn P sychiatric problems\nn Lack of emotional pr eparedness for parenting\nOutline the options for her stage of pregnancy and \nthen explore how each could fit into her situation  . \nDiscuss practical and emotional resources that \nmight affect her choice, such as teenage parenting \nprograms, public assistance, prenatal diagnosis of \nbirth defects, and single parent support groups  .Refer to a health care provider immediately if client \nneeds additional counseling about her choices or \nwants a TAB.How early a woman is first seen during the \npregnancy will determine her options:\nn B efore 16 weeks\u2014all options are available\nn B etween 16 and 24 weeks\u2014abortion needs \nspecialized counseling for the complex psychological and medical aspects involved\nn A fter 24 weeks\u2014abortion is generally not an \noption. The client needs to consider parenting the child or placing the child for adoption\nn A doption is an option to be considered for a \nwoman of any age, not just a teen\nPage updated 2019PSY  |  8\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALUnwanted Pregnancy\nDiscuss how each option fits with her personal and \ncultural values and her spiritual/religious beliefs  .  \nFind out if there is someone she trusts who can give \nemotional support during this time  .\nKeeping the Baby\nSome clients become more attached to the baby \nlater in the pregnancy  .  Refer her to resources to \nimprove her ability to parent  . See the Parenting Stress \nGuidelines and Financial Concerns Guidelines  sections  .\nIf the client continues to consider the child \n\u201cunwanted, \u201d  help her consider life with the child  .  \nShe may agree it would be hard to parent an \nunwanted child  .  A therapist or counselor can help her \nexplore her feelings in more depth before the baby is \nborn  . A session with a social worker can help explore \nthe support options that may be available to her  .  She \nmay reconsider the option of adoption  .\nAbortion\nIf after considering her options, the client wishes to terminate the pregnancy, have the health care \nprovider refer her to the most appropriate medical \nresource  .  Encourage counseling before and after \nthe procedure to help manage emotions, provide \ninformation about the procedure, and help her \nunderstand and cope with her feelings  .  Counseling \nwill also provide education on preventing future \nunplanned pregnancy  .\nIf you work in a setting that does not support the woman\u2019s choice to have an abortion, follow your \ninternal policies for such cases  .\nAdoption\nThere may be a great deal of pressure on the woman\u2014from her partner, family members, friends, \nor institutions\u2014to either keep the child or place the \nchild for adoption  . Encourage her to make a decision \nthat she believes is truly in her best interest and that \nof her unborn child  .  She must live with the decision \nfor the rest of her life  .Give special attention to adolescents, those \nwho have developmental disabilities, those with \npsychiatric problems, and undocumented women  . \nWomen in these groups may be more vulnerable to \npressure  .  There may also be sexual abuse involved \nincluding forced sex or reproductive coercion (putting pressure on a woman to get pregnant \nagainst her wishes, which may or may not include \nbirth control sabotage)  .\nIn most cases, the client should discuss her plans \nwith the baby\u2019s father, who is usually required by \nlaw to sign papers consenting to the adoption  .

This can \nhappen at preterm births or at the end of a full-term \npregnancy  .\nEach person experiences perinatal loss in a unique \nway .  Although the situations and reactions differ, \nmany of the issues surrounding different kinds of loss \nare similar  .\nFamilies from different cultures will have different \nattitudes toward the death of an infant, an autopsy, \npreferences for burial, and normal expressions of \ngrief  .  If you are not familiar with a client\u2019s beliefs, \ncustoms, or rituals, let her know  .

You may say something \nlike: Many parents find it helpful to say goodbye to \ntheir baby  .\nContact social service staff at the delivery hospital to alert them to the family\u2019s need for \nservices during the mother\u2019s hospitalization  . Ask \nif the woman can be moved from the maternity unit following delivery, to avoid contact with \nother mothers and their newborns  .  Following her \ndischarge, re-contact the hospital to coordinate any \nfollow-up plans  .\nFollow Up\nTry to schedule the postpartum visit so the grieving family will not be in contact with \npregnant women and newborns. Inform clinic staff, \nboth health care and clerical, of the perinatal loss so they can express sympathy or at least not ask about \nthe baby  .\nSome staff often feel uncomfortable with the grieving family. Be aware of your own feelings and \nurges to avoid the family  .  Nonverbal body language \nand simple expressions of concern are usually much \nappreciated  .Assessment and Ongoing Help\nAllow the family to describe their experiences at \nthe hospital and after discharge  .  Retelling the story \nmay help them feel it really happened  .\nEvaluate symptoms of grief:\nn Lack of appetit e\nn I nability to return to normal activities (such as \ntaking care of other children, working, socializing \nwith others, etc  . )\nn I rritability and anger\nn Difficult y concentrating\nn Sleep distur bances (not being able to sleep, \nsleeping too much, having nightmares)\nn Apath y (not caring about anything)\nn F atigue (tiredness)\nn Unable t o think about much else besides images \nof the baby or hearing the baby cry\nn Flashbacks\nn Crying\nThese symptoms are common in the early stages of \ngrief  .

It can be a major problem such as \nmissing portions of the brain or a relatively minor \none, such as an extra finger  .  The defect may not \ninterfere with the normal life of the individual, can \ngreatly affect his or her life, or even lead to death  . \nSome birth defects can be corrected while others \nhave no effective treatment  .\nTypes of Abnormalities\nStructure: the physical form that the body takes \non as it grows and develops  .  A body part may \nbe missing, misshapen, or duplicated  .  Examples \nare open spine (spina bifida), water on the brain (hydrocephalus), clubfoot, cleft lip or palate, extra \nfingers or toes, and dwarfism  .\nFunction: the way one or more parts of the body \nwork  .  It may be related to a chemical deficiency  .  \nExamples are color blindness, muscular dystrophy, \nand some mental defects  .\nMetabolism: the way the body changes certain \nchemicals into others  .  For example, a child with \ngalactosemia is unable to produce a substance \nneeded to break down milk sugar  .  Other examples \ninclude PKU (phenyl-ketonuria) and Tay-Sachs disease  .\nBlood: problems with being able to carry out its normal duties due to a reduced or missing blood \ncomponent  . Examples include sickle cell anemia, \nhemophilia, and thalassemia  .\nWhen defects commonly occur together, they are \ncalled a syndrome  .  For example, Down syndrome and \nfetal alcohol syndrome are both conditions in which there is mental retardation together with typical \nstructural defects  .Causes of Birth Defects\nBirth defects have several causes:\nn Genetic\nn Environmental\nn A C ombination of Both\nGenetic Birth DefectsA genetic birth defect is present from the time of \nconception  . It can be caused by a mistake during \nthe development of the sperm or egg that forms the \nfetus  .  The birth defect may never have occurred in \nthe family in the past  . An example of this would be \nDown syndrome  .  Or the birth defect can be inherited \nfrom either the father or the mother  .  The trait will \nhave occurred before in the family and may be from \neither parent or both  . The parent who passed the \ntrait to the child inherited it from his or her parent \nor parents  .  Color blindness and hemophilia are \nexamples of birth defects inherited from either the \nmother or the father  .\nEnvironmental Birth DefectsAn environmental birth defect is one that occurred \nsometime during the pregnancy or delivery because \nof some influence from outside the baby\u2019s body  .  \nGenerally the effect is greater earlier in the pregnancy \nwhen the growth of the fetus is very rapid and the \nmajor body parts and systems are taking shape  .  This \ncan happen as a result of the mother getting sick, \ntaking harmful drugs, or eating poorly  .\nFor example, rubella (German measles) early in pregnancy can cause deafness, heart defects, eye \nproblems, and nervous system damage in the baby \ndepending on when the mother becomes ill during \nthe pregnancy  .  Sexually transmitted diseases such \nas syphilis, gonorrhea, or herpes can cause severe \nPage updated 2019PSY  |  24\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALBirth Defects\nmental or physical damage to the baby  .  Alcohol, \ntobacco, some prescription drugs, and \u201cstreet drugs\u201d \ncan damage the developing fetus  .  Poor maternal \nnutrition can cause fetal malnutrition and poor \nmental and physical development in the baby  .\nBirth Defects Caused by Genetic and \nEnvironmental Factors\nMost birth defects are thought to be caused by \na combination of genetic and environmental \nfactors  .  How strongly a child may be affected by \nan environmental cause, for example, may depend \non his or her genetic background  .  Many normal \nbabies may be born to mothers who took a certain \ndrug during the pregnancy  .  Possibly these children \ninherited a greater resistance to the drug than did \nchildren who were born with negative effects  .\nEach year as many as 250,000 babies are born with \nbirth defects in the United States  .  The most common \nbirth defects result from being born prematurely  . \nThese babies have immature organs unready to \nfunction outside the mother\u2019s womb  .  Malformations \nof the heart are the second most common  . \nSome birth defects are more common in certain \npopulations, such as sickle cell anemia in the African \nAmerican community  .  California has a Birth Defects \nMonitoring Project, which keeps track of patterns of \nbirth defects within the state  .\nCultural Views of Birth Defects\nDifferent cultures have their own beliefs about what \ncauses certain birth defects  .  A defect may be seen as \na parent\u2019s punishment by God for previous sins or the \nwork of an evil spirit or other supernatural powers  .  \nTo the client, these views are as believable as the \nmedical explanation  .\nLanguage to Describe Birth Defects\nA variety of words can describe children with birth \ndefects  .  Some are disabled, handicapped, retarded, \ndelayed, impaired, disordered, challenged, exceptional, or special. The general public uses certain words; \nmedical or legal professionals use others  .  Some \nwords used in the past such as crippled are no longer \nused  .  The client may have her own words to describe \nthe disability  .\nToday we are urged to use language that shows respect for the person\u2019s strength and individuality, \nsuch as a person with a disability rather than a \ndisabled person  . This acknowledges that the \nindividual is a person first and someone with a disability second.\nTreatment of Birth Defects\nFew birth defects can be completely corrected  .  \nHowever, available treatments can slow, stop, or \npartially reverse harmful effects  .  These include:\nn Corrective surgery for structural defects such \nas cleft lip and palate, clubfoot, and various heart \nmalformations\nn Chemical treatment by drugs, hormones, or \nvitamin and dietary supplements or restrictions; \nfor example insulin for diabetes and protein \nsubstitute for PKU\nn Prostheses such as hearing aids and mechanical hands\nn Transplants such as corneas, kidneys, and bone\nn Rehabilitative training to deal with mental, physical, and sensory handicaps\nPrevention of Birth Defects\nSome birth defects can be prevented  .  Encourage the \nwoman to keep all her prenatal care appointments, follow nutrition guides, and avoid harmful substances \nsuch as alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs  .\nMore Information on Birth Defects\nContact your local March of Dimes to receive client \neducation materials on birth defects  .PSY  |  25\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALBirth Defects\nWhat to Look For\nPrenatal Diagnosis\nIf the client has had a previous child with a mental \nor physical problem, the health care provider may \nsuggest genetic counseling  . A genetics counselor will \nask questions about the health of each parent\u2019s family  . \nThe counselor will try to determine if the birth defect \nis the result of genetic or environmental factors and \ngive an idea of how likely the same problem will occur \nin other children  . The counselor helps parents make \ninformed decisions and shares community resources  .\nGenetics counseling is available through Prenatal \nDiagnostic Centers (PDCs) located throughout \nCalifornia  . The Genetic Disease branch of the California \nDepartment of Health Care Services approves these \ncenters  .  Depending on her insurance, prior approval may \nbe required  .  Call 1-916-445-4171 for more information  .\nTests that can identify possible problems include:\nAmniocentesis: A hollow needle is inserted into \nthe pregnant woman\u2019s uterus to draw out some \nfluid surrounding the fetus  .  The test is usually done \nbetween 15 and 24 weeks of pregnancy  .  Cells from \nthe fluid, or the fluid itself, are analyzed  .  Analysis can \ndetect genetic and metabolic disorders  .\nChorionic villus sampling (CVS): Cells from the \ndeveloping placenta are obtained early in pregnancy, \nusually between 10 and 12 weeks  .  Analysis can \ndetect genetic and metabolic disorders  .\nBlood tests: Blood tests of the mother or fetus, such as the Expanded AFP blood test is usually done \nbetween 15 and 20 weeks  .\nSonograms: The mother\u2019s abdomen is scanned with high frequency sound waves to determine \nfetal position, head size, and rate of fetal growth and \ndevelopment  . With a sonogram the physician may \nsuspect or confirm a birth defect, such as missing \nlimbs and malformed internal organs  .Women with no previous history of babies with birth \ndefects are also offered some of these tests  .  The tests \nare optional and each woman should be counseled \nas to the advantages and disadvantages of taking \nthese tests  .  See the \u201cFirst Steps\u201d introductory chapter \nDecision Making Guidelines  section  .\nSuspected Problems\nIf a birth defect is suspected, further tests may confirm the diagnosis, but often the infant\u2019s full \ncondition cannot be known until after birth  . The \nperiod of waiting is often difficult  . Her reactions may \ninclude shock, disbelief, anger, sadness, and guilt  . She \nmay wonder what she might have done to cause the \nproblem  . Family and friends may also blame her  .  Until \nthe diagnosis is confirmed, she and her family will \nhave to cope with the anxiety of facing the unknown  .\nConfirmed Problems\nEarly in the pregnancy the mother may have the same basic decisions as in an unwanted pregnancy: \nabortion, raising the child, or making an adoption plan \nfor the child  .  Later in the pregnancy, abortion is not an \noption  . The family will have the two remaining options  .\nTermination Due to Birth Defects\nA genetic counselor can help clients considering \ntherapeutic abortion to understand the diagnosis \nof the fetus and choose among available options  .  \nThis is an opportunity to evaluate their personal and religious values and to learn more about services \nfor the child should they decide to continue the \npregnancy  .  See Unwanted Pregnancy and Perinatal \nLoss Guidelines.PSY  |  26\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALBirth Defects\nVoluntary Placement of Child in the \nChild Welfare System\nSome families will decide they cannot care for a \nchild with birth defects  .  They may need temporary \nor long-term relief from the care of the child by \nvoluntarily placing the child outside the home, in a \nstate-licensed residence or in a foster home  .  Parents \nmight also choose to place the child for adoption \nwith another family  .  These decisions cannot be made \nuntil after the birth of the child, but can be explored \nprenatally  .  After delivery, their options can be \nevaluated with a local child welfare agency  .\nRaising the Child\nOver the last 20 years there has been increased interest in helping people with disabilities participate \nmore fully in community life  .  More children with birth \ndefects are being raised in their own families instead \nof being placed in institutions  .  Many community-\nbased services are now available to help the family \nmeet the child\u2019s special needs  .\nPostpartum Diagnosis\nA large number of many birth defects will not be \ndiscovered until after the baby is born  . Some birth \ndefects may be quite obvious at the time of delivery, \nsuch as club foot or Down syndrome  .  Some birth \ndefects will not be discovered until the baby grows or when the child enters school, such as a baby whose \nmother took drugs during her pregnancy  .Steps to Take\nWhen there is suspicion of a birth defect:\nn Help the client find a suppor t person to \naccompany her to the tests that have been suggested to check on the fetus\nn Help the family understand what is suspec ted \nabout the baby\u2019s condition  . Help them ask \nappropriate questions of the medical staff  .  \nDetermine the parents\u2019 level of understanding of \nthe explanations they are given  .\nn A cknowledge their feelings of fear, anxiety, and \ngrief\nn R emain available to offer support\nn A ssess the strengths within the family  .  Encourage \ncontact with supportive family members, friends, or someone from their religious or spiritual \ncommunity  .\nn T alk to the family about a referral to a social \nworker or other mental health professional\nFollow Up\nWhen the birth defect is confirmed:\nn R emain available to offer support when the family \nis ready\nn B e prepared for a range of emotions--anger, \nsadness, fear, confusion \nn Allo w them to express their feelings\nn A ssess for feelings of depression  .  See the \nDepression Guidelines section for suggestions  .\nn When the family is r eady, help them prepare \nfor the decisions that need to be made by prioritizing what needs to be done first and what \ncan wait until later  .\nPage updated 2019PSY  |  27\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALBirth Defects\nn Help the family pr epare for the birth of the baby  .  \nEncourage them, if possible, to tour the hospital \nand meet the staff  .  It might be helpful to visit the \nNewborn Intensive Care Unit and get used to the \npolicies and equipment  . Be sure the family has a \nreferral for specialized pediatric care  .\nn A sk if they want to talk to parents of a child \nwith a similar condition  . A network of family \nresource centers can be found by contacting your \ncommunity\u2019s Early Intervention Program  .

They may include family training, \nspecial instruction/education, occupational or \nphysical therapy, psychological services, case \nmanagement services, medical screenings, \nassessments, and other related services based on the \nneeds of the child and the family  .  Call your county \nhealth department to locate the early intervention \nprograms in your area  .\nSupport Groups for Families with \nSpecial Needs\nSome communities have groups that meet regularly \nto explore feelings, share problems and concerns, and \nlearn more about how best to care for their children  . \nSome groups deal with a single problem such as \nparents of blind children  . Others include families \nwith children who have a range of conditions such as \nparents of children with genetic disorders  .  Some are \ndesigned for siblings of children with birth defects  .\nCalifornia Children\u2019s Services (CCS)\nServes children under the age of 21 who have:\nn A handicap r equiring orthopedic treatment or \nplastic surgery\nn Hear t disease\nn Epilepsy\nn C ystic fibrosis\nn V ision problems that require surgery\nn Hear ing problems\nn HIV inf ection\nn Blood diseases\nCCS can provide:\nn Diag nosis of the problem\nn Help in finding appr opriate health care\nn Help with financial planning\nn F und some or all of the medical careSupplemental Security Income (SSI)\nSee the Financial Concerns Guidelines  section  .\nDisabilities Rights Advocates\nNumerous local, state, and federal laws affect people \nwith disabilities  .

Early physical \ncontact through breastfeeding, rooming-in, holding \nskin-to-skin, and cuddling the baby set the stage for \nthe baby\u2019s healthy development  . \nWhat to Look For \nDuring the first three years of life, your child\u2019s brain will undergo a period of rapid growth \nand development  . Physical, motor, cognitive, \ncommunicative, and social and emotional development undergoes rapid growth in these \nearly years  .  Positive parent-baby/child interactions \nwill have a positive effect on a child\u2019s social and \nemotional development  . It is important to track your \nchild\u2019s developmental milestones and share any \nconcerns with your child\u2019s primary care provider  .  Early \nidentification and intervention for developmental delays are key for optimal outcomes for children \nidentified with developmental delays  .  \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has developed a number of resources for parents and \nstaff to monitor developmental milestones from birth \nto 5 years, through its \u201cLearn the Signs  .  Act Early  .\u201d  \nn P arents and providers can \u201cAct Early\u201d if there are \nconcerns about a child\u2019s development  .\nn I t is important to remember that tracking \nyour child\u2019s developmental milestones is not a \nsubstitute for use of a validated, standardized \ndevelopmental screening tool as recommended \nby the American Academy of Pediatrics  .  \nn I t is recommended to have a general \ndevelopmental screen at 9-, 18-, and 30- months \nof age and whenever there is a concern about a \nchild\u2019s development  . n An autism-specific scr een is recommended at age \n18- and 24- months  .  \nn T here are screening tools specific to social and \nemotional development  . \nResources \nThere are photos and videos about developmental milestones on the CDC website and in the mobile \napp .  \nYou can order print materials at:\nwww  . cdc . gov/ncbddd/actearly/freematerials  . html\nYou can find milestone checklists, photos, videos, and even children\u2019s books at: \nwww  . cdc . gov/ncbddd/\nactearly/index  .html\nDownload CDC\u2019s Milestone Tracker App (English and Spanish) at \nwww  . cdc . gov/ncbddd/actearly/\nmilestones-app  . html  \nPage updated 2019This page intentionally left blankPSY  |  31\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALFinancial Concerns\nRefer to supervisor immediately if you\u2019re unable to \nfind emergency shelter or food for a client.Background\nhe CPSP client will often have many \nfinancial concerns  .  Although you may \nnot be able to solve all of her financial \nproblems, you may be able to help in some areas  .  \nThis may relieve some of her stress  .  You may also help \nher gain skills that she can use after the baby is born \nto get help for herself and her family  .\nCheck with the resources in your county to find out \neligibility requirements, application procedures, and \nwhat the client needs to bring to her first appointment  .\nRules and regulations for public benefits programs \nconstantly change  .  Legislation may greatly change \nwhat programs are available to the CPSP client and \nher family  .  Try to keep up with current changes that \naffect your clients  .  When in doubt, seek advice from \na welfare rights advocate  .  Refer to the  Legal/Advocacy \nGuidelines  section  .\nAn excellent source is The Peoples\u2019 Guide to Welfare, Health and Other Services in Los Angeles County\n . \nThis guide has information about many statewide programs such as CalWORKs, SSI, WIC, CalFresh \nbenefits, etc  . , and is accurate and up-to-date  .   \nThe Guide is available in both English and Spanish, \ncan be viewed and downloaded at \n http://www  . hungeractionla  . org/peoplesguide/  \nor can be ordered for a small fee  .  Nonprofit \ncommunity agencies that help low income \npeople may also change. Be sure to keep your \nreferral lists up-to-date.\nA client may have many different financial concerns  .  \nThis guideline will address: cash assistance, housing, utilities, food, clothing, and baby \nsupplies. It will also cover the two main kinds \nof financial concerns: emergency and non-emergency. Nonprofit community agencies that \nhelp low income people may also change  .  Be sure to \nkeep your referral lists up-to-date  .Steps to Take\nWhen a client tells you she has financial concerns, ask \nquestions that will give you a better idea of the situation  . \nIs this an emergency? Does she have a place to sleep \ntonight? Is there food in the house? Does she have diapers?\nRefer her to the appropriate community resource to \nhelp her with her immediate problem  . Emergency \nresources are often hard to locate  .  Sometimes great \npatience and repeated efforts are necessary to find \nhelp for the family  .\nReferrals for Cash Assistance\nCalWORKs (California Work Opportunity and \nResponsibility to Kids)\nCalWORKs is a welfare program that gives temporary \ncash aid and services to eligible families with children \nunder 19 years old  .  County welfare departments \noperate the program locally  .  It replaces the former AFDC \n(Aid to Families with Dependent Children) program  .\nQualifying for Cash Aid\nChildren, and the adult relatives who care for them, \nmay be eligible to get cash aid  .  Both single parent \nand two-parent families may qualify if there is a child \nwith a deprivation (the death of a parent, incapacity \nof a parent, absent parent, or unemployed or under-\nemployed parent)  .\nApplicants for cash aid must meet income limits  .  \nSome sources of the family\u2019s income are counted, \nsuch as wages, and others are not counted such as \nSSI/SSP payments, tax refunds, and most student \nloans and grants  .\nThe family must also meet limits on property and \nother resources  .  Again, some property is counted \nsuch as cash on hand, savings, and stocks and bonds  .  PSY  |  32\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALFinancial Concerns\nSome property is not counted such as a home if lived \nin by the family, or personal items such as furniture, \nappliances, and tools needed for work  .\nA pregnant woman with no other children on CalWORKs can start receiving cash aid in the third \nmonth prior to the month of the anticipated birth  . \nShe will get a grant for one person and a small amount for the unborn child called a \u201cspecial need \npayment  .\u201d  If she has other children on CalWORKs, she \ncan get the special need payment from the date of \nthe pregnancy verification until the baby is born  . She \ncan get Medi-Cal immediately  .\nPregnant teens with no other children can get cash aid, \nfrom the date of the application with proof of pregnancy  . \nHowever, they must participate in the Welfare-to-Work Teen Parent Program to earn a high school diploma or the \nequivalent unless they are exempt  . Refer the client to the \nlocal Welfare-to-Work Teen Parent program  .\nIf she has never been married, she must live with her own parent, a guardian or another adult relative, or in an \nadult-supervised arrangement in order to qualify  .  If living \nwith her parent(s), their resources and income would be considered in determining eligibility for the teen but not \nthe unborn child  .  There are a few exceptions to this rule  .\nIf the pregnant woman is undocumented or receives SSI and has no other children on CalWORKs, she must \nwait until the child is born to get benefits for the baby  .\nThe rules and regulations are complicated and often change. Trained staff will determine if the \nfamily qualifies.\nTime Limits for Cash Aid\nAdults can only get CalWORKs cash aid for four years (48 \nmonths) in a lifetime  .  Any month the adult gets cash \naid counts against the 48-month time limit, even if the \nperson is entitled to only a few dollars a month  . The client \nwill need to decide if it is worth \u201cusing up\u201d a month of \neligibility to get a small amount of cash  .

Learn as much as \nyou can about their immigration \nexperience. See Cross Cultural Communication \nGuidelines  in the \u201dFirst Steps\u201d chapter  .\nGeneral Concerns\nNew immigrants are likely to have many emotional concerns such as:\nn F eeling homesick and missing loved ones left behind\nn R egretting their decision to come to the U  . S  .\nn I nability to return home\nn Exper iencing culture shock and confusion with \nunfamiliar customs, values, and ways of life\nn F eeling conflict and tension between younger \nand older generations in the family\nn B eing isolated with limited social support systems\nn Exper iencing constant fear of deportation\nPost-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\nSome immigrants will have experienced significant emotional trauma in their homeland or during \ntheir migration process  .  Some come from war-torn \ncountries where they have suffered or witnessed \nmany horrors  .  Women are sometimes sexually \nassaulted during the process of migration  . These \nexperiences may lead to a mental condition called post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n .\nA person with PTSD may re-experience the trauma  \nthrough painful daydreams (flashbacks) or nightmares  . \nEach episode may last from several minutes to several \ndays  .  Anxiety, depression, fear, distress, irritability, \ndetachment, and numbing of the emotions \nalso commonly occur with this disorder.  It can \nbe treated through individual or group counseling, \nself-help support groups, and/or drug therapy  .  See \nthe Emotional/Mental Health Concerns Guidelines \nsections for additional assistance  .Financial Concerns\nNew immigrants often have many financial concerns  . \nFamily members\u2019 ability to find work depends on their \njob skills, whether or not they have legal authorization \nto work, and their ability to communicate in English  . \nUndocumented persons will often have difficulty \nsecuring steady or fair paying jobs  .\nIf the family needs financial assistance, immigration status determines which government benefits they \nmay receive  .  These benefits are sometimes called \n\u201cpublic\u201d benefits  .  Children born in the U  . S  .  are citizens \nand are eligible for a full range of government \nbenefits  .  Legal permanent residents (LPRs) can \nreceive most, but not all, public benefits  .  In most \ncases, undocumented people are not eligible for \ngovernment assistance  .  However, they may be able \nto receive assistance from private agencies such \nas churches  .  See the Financial Concerns Guidelines \nsection for further guidance  .\nImmigration Status\nAn immigrant is someone who enters another country with the intention to live there temporarily \nor permanently  .  Students and tourists are considered \nnon-immigrants  .  The federal government\u2019s United \nStates Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), formerly known as Immigration and Naturalization \nServices (INS), recognizes many categories of \nimmigrants  .\nThe rules and regulations are complex and \nchange from time to time as the result of new \nlaws.

These benefits are \nsometimes called \u201cpublic\u201d benefits  .\nA child born in the U  . S  .  is a citizen and is eligible \nfor the full range of government benefits  .  If \nundocumented parents are applying for benefits for a citizen child or other eligible child, they do not have \nto tell the agency that they are undocumented  .  They \nmay simply tell the worker that they are not eligible for the program and are seeking assistance for the \ncitizen child only  .\nEligibility for legally admitted immigrants may depend on:\nn T heir immigration classification\nn Whether the y entered this country before or after \nAugust 22, 1996n Ho w long they have lived in the U  .

S  .  citizen \nor can be credited with 40 quarters of work (usually 10 \nyears)  . There are two major types of affidavits:\nn T he \u201ctraditional\u201d Affidavit of Support (Form I-134), \nis the main form used before December 19, 1997  . \nThis affidavit of support is not an enforceable \ndocument  .\nn T he \u201cenforceable\u201d Affidavit of Support (Form \nI-864) went into use on December 19, 1997  . It is a \nbinding contract by the sponsor for support of the \nimmigrant, and for repayment of certain benefits \nreceived by the immigrant such as CalWORKs, SSI, CalFresh (Food Stamps) (unless the sponsor is also receiving CalFresh (Food Stamps) and is part of \nthe same household as the immigrant), and non-\nemergency Medi-Cal  .  A new Form I-864 went into \neffect on October 19, 2006  . For those sponsors who \nare eligible to use it, the Affidavit may be submitted \non Form I-864EZ  . Regulations governing the use of \nForm I-864 are located in 8 CFR Section 213a  .\nSponsor Income\nSponsors who sign \u201cenforceable\u201d affidavits must show that they earn enough to support a household that \nincludes the immigrant, family members joining the \nimmigrant, and the sponsor\u2019s family, at 125% of the \nfederal poverty level  .  Sponsors who can\u2019t meet these \nrequirements may find a joint sponsor who also must sign an affidavit of support, promising to support the \nimmigrant  . A joint sponsor must meet all the same \nrequirements as the sponsoring relative, except the joint \nsponsor does not need to be related to the immigrant  .\nSponsored Immigrants and Public \nBenefits Deeming\nThe income and resources of the immigrant\u2019s \nsponsor are considered, or \u201cdeemed\u201d , available to the \nsponsored immigrant when he or she applies for \ncertain public benefits  .  Deeming rules usually make \nthe immigrant ineligible for benefits because adding \nthe sponsor\u2019s income and resources usually makes \n(deems) the immigrant \u201cover-income  .\u201d\nSponsored immigrants can get some other benefits without counting their sponsor\u2019s income or the \nsponsor having to pay back the government  . \nThese include emergency or pregnancy-related Medi-Cal, immunizations, testing and treatment of \ncommunicable diseases, short-term emergency cash \naid, school breakfast and lunch programs, Head Start, \nstudent financial aid, and a few other programs  .  Other \nexceptions to the deeming rules include domestic violence survivors or immigrants who would go hungry \nor homeless without assistance  .  Additional exceptions \nmay be available, depending on the program  .\nPage updated 2019PSY  |  51\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALNew Immigrant\nPublic Charge Issue\n\u201cPublic charge\u201d is a term used by USCIS to classify \npersons who have become dependent on public \nassistance programs  .  It can deny legal permanent \nresident status or the right to sponsor a relative  .  Only \nsome forms of public assistance will be counted when deciding if the person is a public charge, namely \ncash assistance programs such as CalWORKs, SSI, and \nGeneral Assistance (GA) or General Relief (GR)  . Other \nforms of public assistance such as CalFresh (Food \nStamps), WIC, school lunch, vocational training, rent \nsubsidies, and Medi-Cal are not usually counted  .\nConditional LPR (due to marriage to a \nU.S. citizen)\nGenerally, the citizen and alien spouse need to file a \njoint petition to have the conditional status removed \nafter two years  .  Then the alien can become an \nunconditional legal permanent resident  . Under certain \ncircumstances, an alien spouse may receive a waiver and be able to receive unconditional LPR status without \nthe cooperation of her citizen spouse  .  (i  . e . , proving she \nis a battered spouse  . ) For more details, refer the client \nto an immigration attorney; see the Legal/Advocacy Guidelines\n section for further assistance  .\nSteps to Take\nImmigration Status\nAssure the client that her medical record is confidential and will not be seen by officials of the \nUSCIS  . You will be asking her questions about her \nimmigration status in order to better determine \nher eligibility for appropriate services  .  You or other \nstaff will not report her and her family to USCIS if \nshe is here without legal papers  .  If she has concerns \nabout her immigration status or eligibility for public \nbenefits, do not try to provide legal advice  .  Refer her \nto an immigration advocate or agency where her \nquestions can be answered  .Immigration Experience\nGently ask questions about her reasons for leaving \nher native country  .  Questions may include:\nn Did she want to come to the U.S.?\nn D id she come because of a spouse, parent, or other \nperson?\nn D id she experience trauma such as war or extreme \npoverty in her homeland?\nAsk about her experience of traveling to the U  .

Like all important work, \nthere is stress from time to time  .  Parents \ncan feel overwhelmed and even dissatisfied with \ncaring for their children  . You can help a pregnant \nwoman prepare for the demanding task of caring for \nher newborn, which may also decrease the stress she \nmay experience about parenting  .\nParents who experience a lot of stress may take it out \non their children  . Mandated Reporters are required by \nstate law to report suspected child abuse or neglect \nto the authorities  .  See the Child Abuse and Neglect \nGuidelines  section  .\nEvery culture has its own parenting values  .  There are \ndifferences among cultures in what parents expect of a child at a certain age and attitudes toward child \ndevelopment  . What may be considered positive \nchild rearing in one culture may be frowned upon in \nanother  .  Discipline practices may vary as well  .  Some \ncultures may rarely discipline unless real danger exists; others may rely on verbal correction and \nguidance; others may approve of corporal (physical) \npunishment; others may use indirect methods such \nas shame  .\nWhat to Look For\nFor the Pregnant Woman\nAll women expecting a child face a period of \nadjustment  . Even with a planned and wanted \npregnancy, caring for a dependent and needy \nnewborn can be a tremendous strain  .\nExperienced parents may also have difficulties  .  Many \nfactors determine how much stress a woman will \nface .  Although it is impossible to predict how a client \nwill do once her baby is born, you may be able to \nguess which clients may experience a lot of stress  .  \nThese may include clients who:Inform your supervisor immediately if you suspect \nthat a child has been harmed or is in danger of being \nharmed.\nn Ar e teens, especially young teens\nn Ha ve a history of intimate partner abuse\nn Ha ve emotional concerns such as marital stress or \nother family problems\nn W ere abused or neglected as a child\nn Ha ve a history of being violent\nn Lack social suppor t, such as some single parents \nor new immigrants\nn Ha ve severe financial concerns, such as being \nunemployed or homelessness\nn Ar e expecting a child with problems, such as \nbirth defects\nn Ha ve alcohol or substance abuse problems\nn Ha ve a physical illness or disability\nn Ha ve a mental illness or disability\nn Ha ve an Intellectual and/or cognitive learning \ndisability\nn Ar e developmentally delayed\nn Ha ve a baby who is premature\nFor guidance on how to help a client with some of \nthese stresses, see the \u201cTable of Contents\u201d for the \nPsychosocial section in this manual  .\nFor the Pregnant Woman with Other \nChildren\nA client may tell you of parenting stress during the \ninterview  .

Is she \nconfident or scared? What does she need to learn or do to help her prepare for being a parent? Ask \nquestions like:\nn Do you have any ideas about how you\u2019ll handle\u2026 ?\nHelp prepare the pregnant woman, and her partner, if available, by letting them know what to expect, \nespecially in the early weeks and months of the \nbaby\u2019s life  .  Say things like:\nn A lot of new parents find themselves wondering\u2026\nn Many par ents find it useful to\u2026\nn Y ou may want to try\u2026\nn Many c ouples experience\u2026For the Pregnant Woman with Other \nChildren\nBuild on Strengths\nAcknowledge that being a parent has its ups and \ndowns, and you know she\u2019s trying to do her best  .

Say something like:\nn Being a parent is a difficult job. Are there times when it seems worth all the effort? Can you tell me about one?\nBuild Upon Parental Strengths Rather than \nFocusing on Weaknesses\nLet her know when you think she\u2019s doing a good job  .  \nSay something like:\nn It\u2019s so nice to see a parent who . . .\nn I lik e the way you . . .\nn Y ou seem really good at . . .\nHelp the mother identify positive things about her \nchild  .  Some behaviors that the mother identifies as \nbad can be reflected to her as acceptable  .  For example \nif the mother is angry at a toddler who is busy pulling \nopen all the drawers in the exam room, you may say:\nn What a curious child! She really wants to find out more about her world. Maybe we can help her \nexplore something else besides the drawers. Here\u2019s a \ntoy that she might like to play with.\nHelp the Parent Make a Plan for Changing the \nChild\u2019s Behavior Over Time\nSay something like:\nn Let\u2019s see if we can figure out a better way.\nn W ould you like help in finding a way that works?\nHelp her figure out the steps in teaching the child, \nand make plans for how long it may take and what to \ndo if the plan doesn\u2019t work  .PSY  |  55\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALParenting Stress\nHelp her identify the child\u2019s positive behaviors \ninstead of negative behaviors  . Help her determine \nif the child is capable of such behavior at his/her \nstage of development  . For example, is it reasonable \nto expect an 18 month old to sit quietly for half an hour while the mother watches a video on \nchildbirth? Is it reasonable for a 3 year old to have \nresponsibility for watching the newborn while the mother naps?\nExplore what methods she has tried in the past. \nWhat was effective and what was ineffective?\nProvide information on behavior management \ntechniques for children of different ages. Contact \nyour local Child Abuse Prevention Council for \nsuggestions  .\nEncourage the woman to focus on positive behavior. Reward good behaviors as much as \npossible  .\nIgnore unwanted behavior if it is not harmful  to \nsomeone or something  .  An example of this is a toddler \ntemper tantrum  . The child should be praised as soon \nas the inappropriate behavior stops and when the \nchild does something approved of by the parent  .\nDistraction works well especially with young \nchildren  . Suggest alternatives  .  If the child stands on \nthe table, suggest:\nn Come sit next to me, and I will show you some pictures in this book.\nSome behaviors can\u2019t be ignored  .  If a child is hurting \nhimself or others or damaging something, the parent \nwill have to intervene as unemotionally as possible  . \nShe can say something like, \u201cI can\u2019t let you do this  .  I \nwill have to help you stop until you can stop yourself  .\u201d  \nSetting limits is an important parenting skill  .  It creates \nstructure, ensures safety and develops healthy boundaries The parent lets the child know that the \nbehavior is unacceptable  .  At the same time she should let the child know what is acceptable  .  For example she \ncan say, \u201cYou may not stand on the table  .  You may sit \nnext to me in this chair  .\u201d\nTime Out\nWith time out the child is taught to spend a short time by him or herself away from the rest of the \nfamily, perhaps one minute for each year of the \nchild\u2019s age  .  This technique stops the child from \ngetting attention for unacceptable behavior and sets \nlimits on what is acceptable  .  It also gives the child \nand parent each a chance to calm down  . When the \ntime is up, the parent calmly explains why he or she \nwas sent to the time out space and what behavior \nshe expects in the future  .\nThe goal is for the child to develop self-control, \nnot to act properly due to fear of punishment  .\nModel Behavior\nSet a good example for the parent in handling the \nchild  .  For example, praise the child for good behavior:\nn Mommy must be really proud of you for making that picture while she\u2019s waiting for the doctor. What a \ngood artist you are.\nPut an arm around the fussy child and say:\nn You seem to be having a bad day. I wonder what \nyou\u2019re trying to tell us.\nAdvise the mother to have patience  .  A different \napproach may take time to show results in changing \nthe child\u2019s behavior  .  Encourage parents to engage in \namiable social conversation in front of their children  . \nThis is a good example of modeling good behavior \nand social interaction  . \nCreate hope by reminding her that there are ways \nshe can relieve her parenting stress  .  Tell her that \nother parents in her situation have found solutions to \ndifficult problems  .\nPage updated 2019PSY  |  56\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALParenting Stress\nGiving Advice\nTry to give nonthreatening, supportive advice \non how to handle the child differently  .  When giving \nadvice, try not to criticize the parent or make her feel \ndefensive  .  Instead of saying You shouldn\u2019t . . . or Stop \ndoing\u2026, try saying:\nn You may get better results if you\u2026\nn Hav e you tried\u2026?\nEmphasize how the different approach may benefit \nher as well as the child  .  Say something like:\nn You\u2019ll probably find it easier to\u2026\nEncourage Parental Responsiveness\nIf the mother is not responsive to the child\u2019s needs, \ngently try to get her to empathize with the child  .  In \nother words, get her to feel what the child may be \nfeeling  .  Say something like:\nn I wonder how she feels when\u2026\nn W hat do you think he feels when\u2026\nn I t must be hard for the child to\u2026\nAttitudes about Child Raising\nAsk how she was raised  .  Does she want to do the \nsame things her parents did or something different? \nIf her parents were abusive, she may not want to use \nthe same parenting techniques  .  She might be less \nlikely to abuse her child if she can remember what it \nfelt like to be a helpless, scared child  .\nFind out what role the child\u2019s father or the mother\u2019s \npartner plays in providing care to the children  .\nn What role do extended family members play? \nn W hat are their ideas about child raising and \ndiscipline? \nn D o they agree or disagree on how the children \nshould be handled? \nn Ho w does she handle parenting disagreements?While you want to respect the family\u2019s cultural values, you also may need to inform some \nfamilies that the discipline techniques they find \nacceptable may be against the law. Discipline that is excessive or forceful enough to leave marks or \ninjuries is considered abusive  .  The use of instruments \nsuch as whips, belts, sticks, shoes, and cords also \nincreases the likelihood of serious injury  .\nThe Importance of Social Support\nThe isolated parent often experiences a lot of \nparenting stress  .  Help her see the need for support \nsystems and how to develop them  . Discuss \nthe possibility of getting help from her current community, which may include: extended family, \nfriends, neighbors, place of worship, support groups, \nparenting and childbirth preparation classes, and ESL \n(English as a Second Language) classes  .\nEncourage her to find one or two women she can call \nwhen she feels angry or frustrated  .  They can support \neach other  .\nSeeking Outside Assistance\nGive all parents the number of the parental stress line, \nif you have one in your community  .  Most are staffed \nby trained volunteers and operate 24 hours a day  .\nIf you think the family needs outside assistance, \nexplain the benefits of a referral  .  See the following \nreferral guidelines  .\nIf the woman is angry with you for suggesting such \nhelp, remain calm  . Don\u2019t take it personally  .  Share \nwith her success stories of other families in her situation (leaving out names and details to maintain \nconfidentiality)  . If she refuses help, tell her that you \nwill be happy to give her the referral again if she \nchanges her mind  .\nIf the mother is interested in the referral, you may \nwant to help her call from your office  .

(Penal \nCode \u00a711166(g)  . It is important that those who \ndon\u2019t function in the role of a mandated reporter communicates suspected or alleged abuse to their \nsupervising licensed health practitioner or the CPSP \nPractitioner\u2019s supervising physician  . \nThis practice ensures that the physician or licensed \nCPSP Practitioner meets his or her reporting duties  .  \nKeep in mind:\nn CPSP P ractitioners should inform licensed medical \nand mental health staff of the high-risk situation  . \nThe mandated staff member has the responsibility \nto assure a report has been completed in the Inform your supervisor immediately if you suspect that a \nchild has been harmed or is in danger of being harmed. \nIt is extremely important for all CPSP offices and clinics \nto have Policies and Procedures in place on how they will handle Mandated Reporting in their practice.\nspecific timeframes mandated by California law  .  \nCA Penal Code S 11165  .9 and 11166\nn A r eport must be made if there is a reasonable \nsuspicion that a child is being abused or \nneglected  .  You do not need to prove that abuse/\nneglect occurred or know who did it to make a \nreport  . It is up to the authorities to investigate  .  \nThe law was made to protect the children and \nget help for their caregivers  .\nWhat to Look For\nThere are several ways you may learn that a child is \nbeing abused or neglected  .\nThe client may tell you of reportable abuse or neglect \nduring the interview  .  For example, she may say:\nn T hat she lost control and slapped the child in \nthe face when she was angry at the child for \ndisobeying \nn T hat her boyfriend burned the toddler with his \ncigarette to punish her for wetting her bed\nn T hat she left the 5 year old alone at home all day \nunsupervised\nn T hat her uncle is sexually abusing his adolescent \ndaughter\nn T hat she sold her CalFresh (Food Stamps) to buy \ndrugs and the children haven\u2019t eaten in two days\nYou may also observe reportable abuse or neglect in \nyour office  .

It is most often the \nresult of severe physical (corporal) punishment  . It is \nconsidered abusive if discipline is excessive or forceful \nenough to leave injuries  .  These may include striking, \nshaking, pushing, pulling or throwing the child  .  This \ndefinition also includes intentional, deliberate assault \nsuch as burning, biting, cutting, poking, twisting \nlimbs, or otherwise physically torturing a child  .\nPhysical Neglect\nThe law divides physical neglect into two categories: \nsevere neglect and general neglect  .\nSevere neglect: endangering the child\u2019s health by intentional failure to provide adequate food, clothing, \nshelter, medical care, or supervision  .\nGeneral neglect: failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical care, or supervision where the \nchild\u2019s health has not been endangered  .  This is reportable \nonly to county welfare, not to law enforcement  .Sexual Abuse\nIncludes acts over a long period of time or a single incident that involves:\nSexual assault: rape, incest, sodomy, molestation, or \nother acts\nSexual exploitation: child pornography or \npromoting prostitution or sex trafficking \nSee the Teen Pregnancy and Parenting Guidelines \nsection for information on child abuse reporting laws \nfor consensual sexual intercourse of minors  .\nEmotional Maltreatment\nThis includes verbal abuse and emotional deprivation  . \nSuch cases are extremely difficult to prove  .  All emotional \nabuse incidents may be reported, but only the most severe cases involving \u201cwillful cruelty or unjustifiable \nmental suffering\u201d are required to be reported  .\nPast Abuse\nA Mandated Reporter is required to report all instances of current and past child abuse and neglect as long as \nthe victim is currently younger than 18 years of age  .  It is \nup to the child welfare agency whether or not they will \ninvestigate the case  .  When a report has been made, the \nMandated Reporter has followed the law by reporting  .\nIf the victim is now an adult and the abuse took place when the victim was younger than 18 years \nof age, a Mandated Reporter is not required to report \nthe past abuse  .  However, if there are other children \nin the home of the abuser and there is a reasonable \nsuspicion that these children may be currently in \ndanger, a Mandated Reporter is required to report \nthis as a possible danger to these children to the local \nchild welfare agency  .\nCultural Differences\nBe aware of different cultural attitudes toward child \nraising and discipline  .  Some immigrant parents may \nneed to be informed that customary discipline legally permitted in their country of origin may be against the \nPage updated 2019PSY  |  61\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALChild Abuse and Neglect\nlaws of this country  .  Some parents may use the same \nsevere physical punishment that they received as a \nchild on their own children  .\nAbused Teens\nIf the teen is younger than 18 years of age and \nphysically or sexually abused by someone in her home, \na Mandated Reporter is required to report to the child \nwelfare agency in his/her community  .  If she is battered \nby someone outside the home, such as a boyfriend, \na Mandated Reporter is usually required to report \nthe assault to law enforcement; they may direct the \nreporter to report to child welfare, depending on the \npolicies of the specific county  .  The teen may be placed \nin a foster home or special teen shelter  .\nSteps to Take\nReporting Suspected Abuse and \nNeglect\nConsult with your clinical supervisor immediately \nif you have any suspicions that a child is experiencing \nabuse or neglect  . This should take place before the \nfamily leaves the office  .  It is extremely important for all \nCPSP offices and clinics to have Policies and Procedures in place on how they will handle Mandated Reporting \nin their practice  .  The Perinatal Service Coordinator in \nyour local health jurisdiction will ask to see site specific \nProtocols, which should reflect this practice  .  \nIf you or your supervisor are unclear as to whether the case should be reported to the authorities, \none of you should call your local child welfare \nagency for a \u201ctelephone consultation\u201d to discuss \nthe case  .  Remember to document the results of \nthe phone consultation in the chart, including the date, time, agency and representative with \nwhom you consulted, and what the representative \nrecommended or advised during the consult  .\nIf your supervisor will file the report , this will meet \nthe mandate; however, always keep documentation that a report has been made within the time required \nby law  .  If your supervisor disagrees with a need for \na mandated report and you still reasonably suspect \na child is being abused or neglected, a Mandated \nreporter would still be required by law to report the \nsuspicion of abuse and a non-mandated reporter is not liable for making a report based upon reasonable \nsuspicion (as this is allowable by California law, and best \nwhen done in accordance with your practice protocols) \nthrough the mandated reporting law requirements  . \nAn employer is forbidden by law to stop or punish a Mandated Reporter who makes or intends to make \na report as long as the reporter has a reasonable \nsuspicion that a child is being or has been abused or \nneglected  .  Source: CA Penal code \u00a71116 (h)-(i)\nThe Mandated Reporter may want to inform the family that he/she is making a report of child abuse \nor neglect  . This is difficult because the family may \nbe very upset or angry  .  However, in most cases, it \nis better to let the family know what is going to be \nreported and why  .\nRemind them that in your first meeting you said all \ndiscussions would be confidential, with the exceptions \nas required by law, such as if you suspected someone \nwas being harmed  .  You need to take steps to protect \nthe child and get help for the caregiver(s)  .\nAsk if they want to be present when the call is made \nto child welfare. This can be helpful in maintaining \ncommunication with them in a time of crisis  .  Tell them \nyou want to help them find a successful resolution for \nthe abuse or neglect investigation  .\nMaking a Report\nWhen reporting, a Mandated Reporter must give his/her name (which will be confidential unless the \ncourt orders the report be released to representatives \ninvolved with the case)  . Non-mandated reporters \nor those not functioning in the role of a Mandated \nReporter may report the suspected abuse at the time \nthe abuse is discovered  .  PSY  |  62\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALChild Abuse and Neglect\nIf the situation is very serious and you feel \nthe child is in immediate danger, call your local \nchild abuse reporting line immediately  .  If there is \nno immediate danger to the child, a Mandated Reporter is required to report it as soon as possible \nby phone  .  Look in the White Pages of the phone \nbook under County Social Services for the reporting \nphone number  .  Or you may find the number in \nthe government pages of the phone book, under the county section; look for Department of Social \nServices or Department of Children and Family \nServices  .  In most communities, you will report to \ncounty welfare services who will then \u201ccross report\u201d or \ninform local law enforcement  .\nWithin 36 hours of the phone report, a Mandated \nReporter is required to file a written report using \nthe Suspected Child Abuse Report Form SS8572  . \nObtain copies of this reporting form from the county \nchild welfare agency and have them available in your \noffice  .  The form can also be downloaded from the \nCalifornia Attorney General\u2019s Office: www  . caag  . state  .\nca .us/childabuse/pdf/ss_8572  .pdf .\nChild Welfare is required by law to inform a Mandated Reporter of the results of any action the \nagency takes  .  They may not share the details of their \nfindings, but will usually let you know if they will continue to provide services to the family or dismiss \nthe case  .\nDealing with a parent suspected of abusing or neglecting a child can be difficult. Discuss the \ndifficulties in a case conference with other members \nof your health care team, as appropriate  .  Ask for \nemotional support, supervision, and training on \nworking with difficult families  .\nFollow Up\nHopefully, the family will continue to see you after \nthe report is made  .  Do not take it personally if they \nchoose not to come back for care at your site or refuse to talk to you  .  You did what the law required or \nallowed in order to protect the child  .\nFind out the results of the report  . Has a child welfare \nworker been to visit? What was that experience \nlike? Did the worker make any recommendations or \nrequirements? Is there a way you can help the family \nfollow through on the child welfare plan?\nAcknowledge that being a parent/caregiver is a \ndifficult job  .\nBuild on strengths rather than focusing on \nweaknesses  .

It is estimated that 1 out of \nevery 12 pregnant women is abused \nduring her pregnancy by her spouse or partner  . \nIt can happen in families of all socioeconomic, \nreligious, and ethnic groups  .\nIntimate partner violence is a pattern of assaultive \nand coercive behaviors including physical, sexual, and \npsychological attacks that adults or adolescents use \nagainst their intimate partners  .\nThe abuse may take many forms  .  There may be \nphysical abuse such as hitting, slapping, kicking, \npushing, shoving, grabbing, biting, attempted \nstrangulation, or assault with an object or weapon  . \nPsychological abuse may also include emotional and economic abuse\n . This can include threats of \nviolence, verbal abuse, social isolation, total control of the family\u2019s finances, or other methods of controlling \nthe victim, such as birth control sabotage  .  There \nmay be sexual abuse including forced sex, or reproductive coercion (putting pressure on a woman \nto get pregnant against her wishes)  . \nPhysical abuse during pregnancy is recognized as a \nsignificant health risk for both the mother and baby  .  If \nabuse occurs, it frequently begins or escalates during \npregnancy  .  Women have reported direct blows to \nthe pregnant abdomen, injuries to the breasts and \ngenitals, and sexual assault  .\nAbused women are twice as likely to wait to begin \nprenatal care until the third trimester  .  They are at \nincreased risk for complications of pregnancy such as poor weight gain, urinary tract and sexually \ntransmitted infections, first or second trimester \nbleeding, anemia, smoking, and alcohol or other drug \nuse . They are also more likely to deliver an infant with \nlow birth weight  .Domestic Abuse Intervention Programs (https://\nwww  . theduluthmodel  . org/) developed the Power and \nControl Wheel and the Equality Wheel which provides \na simple framework to understand the range of abuse \nthat constitutes domestic violence and the tenets of \na relationship built on equality  .

It tends to follow \na pattern called \u201cthe cycle of violence  .\u201d  There are \nusually three phases of the cycle:\nn Increased tension, anger, blaming, and arguing\nn Abusive incidents, that may include  \nhitting, slapping, kicking, choking, use of  \nobjects or weapons, sexual abuse, verbal  \nthreats, or other abuse\nn \u201cHoneymoon\u201d phase, in which the abuser may deny the violence, say they were drunk, say they are \nsorry, and promise that it will never happen again\nThe cycle is usually repeated over and over, getting \nmore frequent and severe  .  The honeymoon phase \nmay get shorter and shorter over time  .\nEffects on Children\nChildren who grow up in a household where a parent \nis abused may suffer physically and emotionally  .  The \neffects will vary according to the individual child, \nbut most children living in a family where the parent \nis abused are also victims of abuse  .  Children are \nfrequently accidental victims when they attempt to \nintervene or protect their parent  .\nEven if the children do not witness the battering, they are affected negatively by being cared for by a \ndepressed or anxious caretaker  .  If a mother is aware \nof the effect on her children, she may be more likely \nto seek help to end the abuse for their sake  .\nUnfortunately, an often unrecognized state of the \nabused mother or spouse is co-dependency  .  A classic \nmodel of co-dependency is the alcoholic abusive \nhusband and his co-dependent wife  .  The personality \ntraits of co-dependency can negatively affect the \nmaturing and coping of the children  .\nSigns of co-dependency can include:\nn Lack of self- esteem or self-worthn Lack of trust in one \u2019s self\nn V aluing others approval and acceptance more \nthan one\u2019s own\nn Difficult y in making appropriate decisions in the \nrelationship with the abuser or the children and making excuses for inappropriate decision-making\nInterviewing the Client\nInterview the client alone in a private setting without \nher partner or children present  . If you are using an \ninterpreter, use a staff member, not a family member \nor friend  .  Tell the support person you are glad they \ncame to the visit, but it is the federal law (HIPAA) and clinic practice to interview each client alone for part \nof each visit  .\nScreen all clients by asking questions about present \nor past abuse  .  Approach the topic like any other \nhealth risk assessment  .\nStart with a statement acknowledging that all families have conflict such as:\nn All families have disagreements\nn All c ouples fight from time to time\nInform the client that because of your concerns for your clients\u2019 health, you ask all of them questions \nabout violence in the home  .  Remind her that her \nresponses will be confidential unless she is being abused and:\nn She has cur rent physical injuries, in which case \nyou are mandated (required) to report to local law enforcement; see the Complicated Situations \nGuidelines \nsection for more information  .\nn She is under the age of 18 and is being abused , \nin which case you are required to report to your \ncounty\u2019s child abuse reporting agency; see the \nComplicated Situations Guidelines section for more \ninformation  .\nAsk general questions about conflict in her home  .  \nPage updated 2019PSY  |  67\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALSpousal/Intimate Partner Abuse\nSample questions include:\nn What are arguments like in your house?\nn W hat happens when your partner doesn\u2019t get his or \nher way?\nn D o you feel safe at home?\nYou may need to ask more direct questions such as:\nn Has your partner ever hit, punched, slapped, kicked, \nor hurt you in any way?\nn Hav e there been times during your relationship \nwhen you have had physical fights?\nEncourage, but do not insist, that the woman \nrespond to your questions.  A woman will choose to \nshare a history of violence when she is ready  .\nIf she denies abuse, but you strongly suspect that it\u2019s \ntaking place, let her know that you\u2019re available to talk \nin the future if she wishes  .\nSteps to Take\nIf the woman admits to physical abuse, get details of current and past occurrences including how badly she \nwas hurt and how often it has happened  .  Ask about \nthe first, worst, and most recent violent assaults  .\nEmpathize with her and validate her feelings; express support by simple statements such as:\nn You are not alone.\nn No one deser ves to be treated this way.\nn Y ou are not to blame.\nn Y ou are not crazy.\nn W hat happened to you is against the law.\nn Help is av ailable.\nReassure the client she does not deserve to be \ntreated this way, and that you are there for support  . \nIntimate partner abuse is against the law. This may be new information to immigrant women \nfrom countries where spousal battering is socially accepted and even legal  .  Offer to listen if she wants \nto talk  .  Ask what you can do to help  .\nRespect the cultural values and beliefs that affect her \nbehavior and decision making  .  These beliefs may be a \nsource of security  .  Do not minimize their importance  .\nFocus on concrete problem solving and emotional \nsupport, not on telling her what to do  .\nIf There are Current Injuries\nA woman with current physical injuries that you \nsuspect are the result of assault or abuse should be \nimmediately referred to the health care provider who \nwill assess and document the extent of the problem  .\nClearly document the client\u2019s statements about the \ncurrent injuries and past abuse using direct quotes \nfrom the client, writing: The client states that  . . .\nExplain to the client that a report to the police is \nrequired by law  .  Inform her of the likely response by law \nenforcement  . In some counties, the report will be filed \nbut the police will not get involved unless requested by \nthe victim  . In other counties, the police will investigate \nand the district attorney will attempt to prosecute the \nbatterer even if the victim does not want to press charges  .\nAsk if she wants to be present during the phone call \nto the police  .

Watch for:\nn An incr ease in how often or severely she is beaten\nn I ncreasing or new threats of homicide or suicide \nby the batterer\nn A batt erer who is severely depressed\nn T hreats to her children, pets, or extended family \nmembers\nn V iolence by the batterer outside the home\nn A w eapon, especially a firearm, in the house or \navailable to the batterer\nn Drug and alcohol abuse b y the batterer (not \nthe cause of violence, but frequently the two \nbehaviors co-exist)\nn W atchfulness/stalking by the batterer of the \nwoman outside the home\nn Obsession b y the batterer about the woman, \nincluding extreme jealousy or accusations of unfaithfulness\nn F orced sexual encounters, reproductive coercion \n(which may include birth control sabotage)n R age by the batterer at the possibility of being \nleft by the woman\nn A shor tened or absent \u201choneymoon phase\u201d; the \nbatterer stops saying he is sorry\nn I ncrease in social isolation of the woman (from \nfamily, friends and others who would offer support or help)\nIn general, the woman is the best authority on matters of her own safety and the best predictor of her partner\u2019s behavior. However, she may also \nbenefit from your feedback and objective assessment \nof the situation  .\nMake a Safety Plan\nIf it is not safe for your client to return home, help \nher explore options for staying with family or friends  .\nIf she is unable to stay with a family member or friend \nor this is determined to be unsafe, help her contact a \nbattered woman\u2019s shelter  . If they are full, they can \nadvise on alternatives  .\nIf the woman decides it is safe to return home, \nencourage her to pack an overnight bag in case \nshe needs to leave quickly in the future  .

She should get a  restraining order as soon \nas possible that can include a temporary custody \norder, if she does not already have each  . This order \ngives her the right to keep the children; otherwise \nthe father has equal rights to the children  .\nAdvise her to be careful with whom she leaves the \nchildren, because the father may try to get them \nback  .  Once she has a temporary custody order, she \nshould notify (verbally and in writing) the child\u2019s school or day care of the problem so they won\u2019t \nrelease the children to anyone other than her  .\nLegal Options\nRefer the woman to a legal resource to help her determine if she is able to remain in the home and \nhave her partner receive a \u201ckick out order  .\u201d  Once \nthe partner is out of the home, advise the woman not to let him back in, even if he seems calm and \napologetic  .  Review the cycle of violence and the \n\u201choneymoon phase  .\u201d\nYou should not provide legal advice; however, you can tell the woman that she has several legal options designed for her protection and she should seek \nadvice on those options, which include:\nn Or ders of protection such as emergency \nprotective orders and restraining orders\nn P ressing criminal or civil charges against the \nbatterer\nRecognizing Danger\nRemind the woman to call 911 in case of \nemergency  . She should tell the police that she is in \nimmediate danger and needs help immediately  .  She \nshould let them know if she has a court order  .  If the \nbatterer is arrested and taken to jail, it is most likely he will be released and the woman may be at increased \nrisk . Assist her in making plans to protect herself  .  \nShe may use the time to quickly gather her personal \nbelongings and find a safe place to stay  .\nRe-evaluate her situation and be sure to reassess her \nsafety and reinforce her options  .\nIf a client chooses to leave the abusive relationship, \nit may take multiple attempts  .  Continue providing \nsupport, client education, and referrals to the woman \nwho stays with her batterer  .\nTry not to be angry or disappointed with a woman who stays with an abusive partner. She may be \ndoing the best she can to cope with her situation  . \nWomen may stay for many reasons  .  These may include \nfinancial, religious, cultural, and many other reasons  . \nIn many cases, the woman wants the abuse to stop, \nnot the relationship with her partner  .  Be honest and \nexplain your concerns for her safety, and let her know that she can always come back to you and you will \ncare about her regardless of her decision  .\nReferrals\nReview with the woman resources appropriate to her \nsituation  .

Write the \nphone number on a clinic appointment card or a \nblank prescription  . Referrals written on these items \nare generally safer than a brochure or resource list  . It \ncan be dangerous for her to have written information \nabout intimate partner violence in her possession  . \nAlways document in the chart what you have done  .\nProvide all clients with an opportunity to learn \nabout community resources for battered women. \nHave pamphlets and other materials that can be \npicked up anonymously from the exam room or \nbathroom where she is usually alone at some point  . \nInformation left in the client waiting area is less likely to be picked up by a battered woman, but may \nbe taken by a concerned friend or family member  .  \nMaterials may be available from local battered women\u2019s shelters or agencies listed in the \u201cResources\u201d \nsection of this chapter  .\nComplicated Situations\nIf the Battered Woman is also a \nSubstance Abuser\nMost battered women\u2019s shelters will not accept \nwomen who are actively using drugs or alcohol  .

She \nis eligible to apply even if she is undocumented  .  An \nimmigration attorney can determine if she qualifies and \ncan help her with her application  .\nIf she and her spouse are both undocumented, she is not eligible to apply for a Legal Permanent Resident \ncard under VAWA  . She may go to a domestic violence \nshelter which will not ask about her immigration status  .\nIf her children are U  .

S  .  citizen or \nlawful permanent resident, and the person being abused does not have to have been married to the \nabuser to be eligible for a U-visa  . The federal law \ngives victims work authorization and California law gives them access to certain public social service, \nincluding, but not limited to, refugee cash assistance, \nMedi-Cal, employment social services, and Healthy \nFamilies Program benefits  .

One essential \nresource is Mother To Baby which provides evidence-based information to mothers about medications \nand other exposures during pregnancy and while \nbreastfeeding  .  In addition to the most up-to-date fact \nsheets, MotherToBaby  . org has many ways to engage \nclients: (1) an on-line \u201cChat Live with An Expert;\u201d (2) a toll free warm line at 866-626-6847; (3) text them at \n855-999-3525; and (4) email  .  These services are also \navailable to health care professionals, and the general \npublic  .  These guidelines cover the addictive use of \nthe following substances:\nLegal Substances\nn Alcohol\nn Marijuana\nn P rescription drugs:\nu Amphetamines: R italin, Aderall, Dexedrine\nu B enzodiazepines: Klonopin, Xanax, Valium \n(also known as Diazepam), Halcion, Rohypnol\nu Bar biturates: Pentobarbital, Seconol\nu Opiat es: Oxycontin, Codeine, Morphine\nIllegal Substances\nn Opiat es: Heroin\nn Cocaine\nn PCP\nn LSD\nn Methamphetamines\nRefer to the Health Education Steps to Take Guidelines \nto help the client who uses tobacco, drugs, or alcohol \non occasion  .\nFor some people, addiction gets worse over time and \ncan be life-threatening if left untreated  .  But it is a treatable disease.  While addicted people may not \nbe responsible for their disease, they are responsible \nfor their recovery  .  Many have sought help and \ncurrently live productive, clean, and sober lives  .\nPregnancy can be a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d when an addicted woman may be highly motivated to \naccept help for her substance abuse  .  Non-punitive \napproaches seem to work the best  .\nRisks of Perinatal Addiction\nAny substance use during pregnancy may cause \nharm to the pregnancy and the developing baby  .  \nEncourage all pregnant women to avoid all drugs \nand alcohol  .\nPregnant women who use substances and their babies are vulnerable to numerous medical \ncomplications such as:\nn Miscarriage\nn P reterm labor\nn Abruptio placenta\nn I ntrauterine growth retardation\nn F etal distress\nn I ntrauterine fetal death\nn Bir th defects\nWhether or not an individual woman will have these \nproblems depends on many factors such as:\nn T he type of alcohol or other drugs used\nn T he amount of alcohol or other drugs used\nn T he frequency of alcohol or other drugs used\nn T he weeks gestation of the pregnancy\nn I ndividual characteristics of the babyPSY  |  78\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALPerinatal Substance Use\nNo one knows why some babies may be more \naffected by their mothers\u2019 substance use than others  .  \nSome women will say, \u201cI used and drank with my \nother kids, and they\u2019re fine  .\u201d  That may be true, but \nthis baby may be affected differently than his or her \nsiblings  .  There is no way of knowing until the baby is \nborn  . By that time, the harm is already done  .\nIt is common for addicted women to use more \nthan just alcohol or one drug  .  If there are medical \ncomplications, they may be due to interactions \nbetween the different substances she uses, or to \nlifestyle choices related to nutrition and health and not \nthe substances themselves  .   . \nWhat to Look For\nAssessing the Woman\u2019s Drug Use\nAs part of the psychosocial assessment and \nreassessment, ask all clients about past and current \nsubstance use including:\nn Type\nn Amount\nn Frequency\nn Dat e of last use\nSome women who use substances will say they \nuse less than they actually do  .  Some will deny use \nbecause they fear disapproval or being reported to \nchild protective services  .  Therefore, you need to be \naware of some of the signs of substance abuse:\nn T he woman\u2019s current status\nn Smell of alcohol on her br eath\nn Slur red speech\nn Stagger ing walk\nn I rritability or extreme restlessness\nn I nappropriate or strange behavior\nn T rouble concentrating\nn Suicidal f eelings, gestures, or attemptsn M ood swings\nn Depression\nn P oor nutritional status\nn M emory lapses and losses\nn Blackouts\nn F requently missed appointments without notice \nand/or frequently arriving very late (hours) to \nappointments\nThe Woman\u2019s Other Children\nn P revious involvement with Children\u2019s Protective \nServices including foster care or placement  with relatives\nn F etal alcohol spectrum disorder\nn L earning disabilities or hyperactivity\nn P oor school performance or behavior problems\nThe Woman\u2019s History\nn C omplicated perinatal history including \npremature birth, growth retardation, or  multiple miscarriages\nn M any emergency room visits\nn P sychiatric treatment or hospitalization\nn Depression\nn I ntimate partner violence\nn P artner is a substance abuser\nn Client \u2019s parent is/was a substance abuser\nn A utomobile accidents or citation arrests\nn Little contac t with family or friends isolation\nSteps to Take\nProvide Education\nDiscuss the woman\u2019s substance use as a  health concern,\n not a moral problem  . Some \npregnant addicts view themselves as bad mothers and suffer from intense feelings of guilt, shame, and \nlow self-esteem  . PSY  |  79\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALPerinatal Substance Use\nExpress your concern for the client and her \ndeveloping baby, and the harm using alcohol and \nother drugs can cause to both the mother and baby  .\nProvide Referrals\nExplain that help is available if she wants to \nstop her substance use  .  Many other women in her \nsituation are leading alcohol and drug-free lives and \ncan show her how to begin  . If possible, refer her to \na substance use treatment program that is woman-focused and can meet her special needs once the \nbaby is born  . County alcohol and drug programs are \naware of such programs  .\nDetermine if the client\u2019s partner is also a substance user. If so, this may contribute to her stress and make \nher recovery efforts more difficult  . Make appropriate \nreferrals for treatment for the partner so they can \nsupport each other in \u201cstaying clean  .\u201d  Support the \nhealthy aspects of the woman\u2019s life such as coming \nfor prenatal care  .  Express interest in her priorities  . \nEncourage her to talk about her feelings  .  Let her know \nyou will support her in her struggle against addiction  .\nInform her that Children\u2019s Protective Services may \nevaluate her situation at the time of delivery  .  They \nmay place the newborn outside the home if they \ndecide that the infant is not safe in her care  .  Let her \nknow that this may be a good opportunity to begin her recovery process and it may make a difference for \nher baby  .\nAct as an Advocate\nOffer to act as an advocate. \nRefer her to a public health nurse or home \nvisitor who can work with her in the home to follow \nthrough on the treatment plan  .\nRefer her to a social worker or psychosocial \nconsultant  .\nIf she reports intravenous drug use, discuss the risk of exposure to HIV through sharing needles having a sexual partner who uses IV drugs, and risky \nsexual practices that can occur while high  . Offer \na referral for HIV testing  .  See the Perinatal Health \nGuidelines, \u201cHIV/STIs\u201d section  .\nIf the client denies alcohol or other drug use after discussing the topics above and you still suspect she \nis using, discuss the case with your clinical supervisor \nand the health care provider for coordinated care  .\nSome addicted people may be very hard to help, \nand others may not want help at all. Assess what kind \nof help she desires and focus on meeting that need  .  Try \nto find out her most immediate concerns and focus on \nspecific things that can be done  .\nPrenatal Exposure to Alcohol and \nOther Drugs\nCurrently, child welfare agencies will not accept a \nprenatal report for alcohol or other drug exposure of the \nfetus  .  This is not considered child abuse  .  A postpartum \nreport may be made by the staff at the delivery hospital \nif the newborn is suspected to be at risk  .\nParental alcohol and other drug use alone, by law, is not sufficient proof for a report of child abuse and \nneglect  . However, if it is reasonably suspected that \nthe child is being abused or neglected, a report \nshould be made  .  See the  Child Abuse and Neglect \nGuidelines  section for further information  .\nFollow Up\nContinue to: \nn Praise her for continuing her prenatal care\nn Assess her alcohol and other drug use\nn Educate her about the health and child welfare consequences of her addiction\nn Refer her for appropriate treatment and supportive services\nn O ffer to act as an advocatePSY  |  80\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALPerinatal Substance Use\nRecognize successes  no matter how small  .  Assure \nher that requesting help is an act of strength and  \nself-respect  .\nRequest a release of information from the client if \nshe is in a substance use treatment program  . This will \nenable you to communicate with her counselor and \nassist in her recovery  .\nSee if she has followed through on any referrals that \nyou made previously such as referrals to public health \nnursing, substance use treatment, and other services  .\nInform the social work staff or medical staff at the delivery hospital of the client\u2019s history of alcohol \nand other drug use  .  This will give the mother and \ninfant appropriate hospital care  .\nRelapse is a normal part of the recovery process. \nThis is not a sign of failure for either the client or you  .  It \nis rare for a person to quit using substances and never \nrelapse  .  Encourage her to talk to her substance use \ncounselor about ways to prevent future relapse  .\nFor women that are receptive, stress the benefits of her quitting at this stage of the pregnancy. \nStress other things she is doing right, such as getting \nprenatal care  .  Every day she does not use alcohol or \nother drugs helps her developing baby  .  Remind her \nof the benefits of a drug-free lifestyle in providing \ngood care to the baby after the birth  .\nDealing with Your Feelings\nSome of your clients will not quit or cut down their \nalcohol or other drug use  .  This may make you feel \nfrustrated, angry, or that you have failed  .  You have \ndone your job if you have maintained a respectful \ntone of service, assessed, educated, referred, \nand offered to act as an advocate  .  You are not \nresponsible for the substance user\u2019s behavior, \nonly your own. Talk with your supervisor or co-\nworkers about your feelings  .

Advocate for her with the \ncounty\u2019s drug treatment agency, stressing the medical \nurgency of treatment  . See the  Teen Pregnancy and \nParenting Guidelines  section  .\nFor a client who is homeless or the victim of domestic violence and actively using substances, finding a \nshelter may be more challenging  .  Help her find a \nmedical detoxification program that accepts pregnant \nwomen so she will be able to go to a shelter  .  See the \nFinancial Concerns and Spousal/Intimate Partner Abuse Guidelines\n sections  .\nIf the client has psychiatric problems that were present before her addiction, she is considered to be \n\u201cdually diagnosed  .\u201d  Individuals with a dual diagnosis \nmay use substances in an effort to seek relief from \ntheir psychiatric symptoms  .  Once the client quits \nusing substances, the psychiatric symptoms such as \ndepression may be more obvious  .  Refer for mental \nhealth services  .

The \nmisuse of opioid medications has \nsignificant consequences for pregnant women and \ntheir babies  .  The prevalence of maternal opioid \ndrug use at the time of delivery in California is \napproximately very low  .  Taking opioid medication \nearly in pregnancy can cause birth defects such \nas neural tube defects, congenital heart defects \nand gastroschisis  .  Neonatal abstinence syndrome \n(NAS) develops in 42 to 94 percent of infants born to narcotic dependent mothers, and often leads to \nprolonged treatment in a neonatal intensive care unit  . \nNAS is a term used to describe the constellation of symptoms experienced by newborns withdrawing \nfrom substances on which they have become \nphysically dependent while in utero  .  Exposure of \nthe fetus to opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, or \nantidepressants may result in NAS  . However, the \nmost common causes are maternal opiate use (e  . g . , \nheroin, methadone) and misuse of prescription \npainkillers (e  . g . , oxycodone)  .  The neonate may be \npoly-drug exposed to illicit and licit drugs, nicotine, \nand alcohol  .  NAS usually manifests between 2-7 days \nfollowing birth, depending on the amount and type \nof substances used by the mother during pregnancy  .\nSymptoms of NAS\nNot all exposed babies will withdraw  .  For those \nthat do, symptoms will vary in severity depending \non drug, dosage, and age of the baby at delivery  .  \nSymptoms of withdrawal may begin as early as 48-72 \nhours after birth or as late as 4 weeks of age  .  Here are \nsome of the most common symptoms of withdrawal \nfor full-term babies: \nn I rritability (excessive crying)\nn H igh-pitched crying \nn Trembling Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome\nn Difficult y sleeping \nn T ight muscle tone \nn H yperactive (overactive) reflexes \nn Seizures \nn Y awning, stuffy nose, and sneezing \nn P oor feeding and sucking \nn Vomiting \nn Diarrhea \nn Dehydration \nn Sweating \nn F ever or unstable temperature\nDiagnosis of NAS\nAn accurate report of the mother\u2019s drug exposure \nis important  . Urine and stool samples will be \ncollected from the infant for toxicology screening  .  \nAn assessment tool, which helps diagnose and grade withdrawal, may be used to evaluate the presence of \nsymptoms  .\nRefer to the Psychosocial section on Alcohol or Drug Use Steps to Take for guidelines on addressing \nsubstance use  .\nReferences:\nStephen W  .

This section of the manual focusses \non screening to determine if the client is a danger to herself, a danger to her child(ren), poses a risk of \ncommitting suicide, or exhibits symptoms which \nsuggest the presence of other mental health issues  .  \nPostpartum Emotional Problems\nPostpartum emotional problems are common \nand may develop for various reasons  .  They may be \ncaused by hormonal changes, genetic factors, poor \ncoping strategies and problem solving skills, and \npsychosocial stresses  .\nCauses of Emotional Problems\nSome emotional problems are related to a specific \nsituation or crisis  .  Some are the result of chemical \nimbalances in the brain  .\nTreatment for Emotional Problems\nTreatments are available, and range from support groups, peer-to-peer support, medication, and \ncounseling from a mental health professional to \nhospitalization if warranted  .  It is important to know the \nresources in your community  .\nCultural Considerations\nEmotional concerns are viewed in very different ways \nby different cultures  .  What may be a problem in one \nculture may be acceptable in another  .  The causes \nand treatments will vary according to the cultural \nbeliefs  .  For example, members of one culture may \nview emotional problems as a punishment from God \nwhile others believe bad spirits or other supernatural \npowers cause them  . Culture also influences the type \nof help, if any, that the client will seek  .Special Considerations for  \nPregnant Women\nSome normal psychological changes can be \nexpected during pregnancy such as:\nn M ore anxiety, especially worries about the baby\nn M ore attention to her own thoughts and feelings\nn Gr eater feeling of being dependent on other \npeople\nn M oods that change more often than before she \nwas pregnant\nn M oods that are \u201chigher\u201d or \u201clower\u201d than before she \nwas pregnant\nMaternity or Baby Blues\nAbout half of all new mothers experience the mildest \nform of postpartum depression often called the \nmaternity or baby blues  .  She complains of tiredness \nand has crying spells that usually start right after \nthe baby is born or as late as two weeks following \ndelivery  .  After a week or so, the mother starts to feel \nmuch better  .  If she was previously was diagnosed \nwith depression, she will likely have the blues after \nher next deliveries  .\nBaby blues can\u2019t be prevented, but they can be lessened by knowing ahead of time that such \nreactions are common in postpartum women  . Social \nsupport and reassurance are also effective  .\nCommon signs and symptoms of Baby Blues may include:\nn Crying\nn Irritability\nn Insomnia\nn T emporary mood swings\nPage updated 2019PSY  |  88\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALEmotional or Mental Health Concerns\nn A positiv e score means a mom is at high risk for \nemotional stress and/or a perinatal mental health \ndisorder\nEPDS and PHQ-9 is considered negative if the total score is 9 or less\nn I f the mom\u2019s score is 9 or less, continue to follow \nthe tool screening schedule  .  However, it is very \nimportant to check the last question of each tool \nwhich asks about suicidal thoughts  .  If the mom \nstates that she is having suicidal thoughts at all, \nthen her screen is considered positive  . \nWhat to do with positive screens?\nn Notify the pr ovider immediately to discuss making \na mental health referral or call 9-1-1 in the event of an emergency\nn 9-1-1 should be called immediat ely when you feel \na patient is unsafe to themselves, others, or their baby\nn D ocument in the chart: the screening, the notification \nof provider, and all referrals/inventions made\nGeneral Anger\nWhen the client\u2019s anger is general and justifiable, help diffuse the anger by listening, giving \ninformation, and offering referrals  .\nYour questions may include:\nn How long has she had this problem?  Did she \nbecome depressed after the breakup with her \nboyfriend or has she been depressed most of her \nlife? Has it been continuous or off and on? When is the last time she can remember being truly happy? \nDoes she see any patterns?\nn How has the problem affected her thinking \nand mood? For example, has it affected her ability \nto concentrate or remember things? Does she \nhave periods of irritability or depression?\nn Does she have physical problems because of the emotional problem such as loss of energy, or \nproblems eating or sleeping?n T emporary sadness\nn Anxiety\nn Difficult y concentrating\nn F eeling overwhelmed\nn Appetit e problems\nScreening\nRegular Screening enables earlier identification of \nmental health and substance use disorders, which \ntranslates into earlier care  .  \nTiming - When to Screen\nn F irst prenatal visit\nn A t least one time in the second trimester\nn A t least one time in the third trimester\nn F irst postpartum OB/GYN visit\nn 6 w eek postpartum OB/GYN visit\nn R epeat screening after delivery at 6 and/or 12 months \nat OB/GYN, Pediatric, or Primary Care settings\nn 3, 9 , 12 months at P ediatric visits\nScreening Tools\nTwo examples of screening tools used are the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Edinburgh \nPostnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)  .

Does she have hope for \nimproving her problem? What does she think might help? Who does she think might help her?\nn Consider writing a letter to the person or place she is angry with. She can send it or  \nkeep it for herself  .\nn A referral may be appropriate if anger is about eviction or other legal matter. Offer an \nappropriate referral (i  .e . , Tenants\u2019 Rights)  .\nSleep Problems\nSleep problems may raise risk for, and even directly contribute to, the development of some psychiatric \ndisorders  .  This research has clinical application, \nbecause treating a sleep disorder may also help alleviate symptoms of a co-occuring mental health \nproblem  . Sleep problems also increase the risk of \ndeveloping depression  . \nhttps://www  . health  . harvard  . edu/newsletter_article/\nsleep-and-mental-health\nn Lack of sleep can be a trigger for irritability, \nanger and/or depression  .

Things that \nwould normally not upset her, like a partner \nasking a question, might be triggers  .  \nAnxiety, Nervousness, or Fears\nWhen a client\u2019s anxiety or fears are about life events \nlistening and offering support can be helpful  .\nAllow the client time to talk  .  Tell me what you are most \nafraid of.n Discuss her f ears .  For example, if she is afraid of \nlabor and delivery, encourage childbirth classes  .\nn I f fears are because of intimate partner violence, \nsee Spousal/Intimate Partner Abuse Guidelines.\nn I f a client describes extreme anxiety or fears that \naffect her daily functioning (such as she\u2019s unable to leave her house alone and has to have someone \nwith her all the time), refer her for mental health \ncounseling  .  If she refuses, notify your supervisor \nand the health care provider for evaluation  .\nGeneral Emotional Concerns\nWhen the client is dealing with her emotional concerns:\nn A ssist her on your own  .  A non-judgmental, good \nlistener may be all that is needed for some clients \nwith certain kinds of problems  .\nn W ork with a consultant or outside agency  .\nAsk Questions and Observe  \nthe Client \nIs she clean and neat or disheveled? Does she have \nan angry or tired expression? Does she complain \nabout eating, stomach, or sleeping problems? These \ncan be signs and symptoms of depression or anxiety  .  \nFor example, you might say: \nYou look like you\u2019re ready to cry. How are things going for you?\nIf unable to identify a characteristic, ask:\nOn an average day what best describes how you feel?  \nDo you feel happy, sad, angry, easily irritated or \ndepressed?\nIf she says she is happy, okay, or something similar, \nno further assessment is needed  .  A negative answer \nsuch as \u201cscared, depressed, easily irritated or angry,\u201d \nneeds further assessment  . Go to the appropriate \nsections: Helping a Client with Anger or Helping a Client \nwith Anxiety, Nervousness or Fears  .

Depression can run in \nfamilies  .  Sometimes depression can happen for no \nreason  . People who are depressed see themselves \nand the world in a negative way  .  Researchers are \nunable to find a single cause of depression  . There \nseem to be many possible factors which include:\nBiological Factors\nDepression can be hereditary and often blood relatives \nmay have suffered the same kind of problem  . \nPsychological Factors\nDepression can be triggered by an event  . For \nexample, loss of a loved one, poor early mother-child \ninteractions, childhood abuse, and managing anger \nby turning it inward  .\nDepression may be:\nn Chr onic (a long-term, continuous problem)\nn Episodic ( comes and goes)\nn O ccur only once in a person\u2019s lifetime\nDepression has certain signs and symptoms  .  It is \nimportant that she discuss any of these feelings with her medical provider or a licensed mental health \nprofessional  .n F eeling sad and/or irritable\nn Not enjo ying things that used to be fun (being \nwith friends, sports, hobbies, sex)\nn Unexpec ted changes in appetite and/or weight\nn Unexpec ted changes in sleep patterns, sleeping \ntoo much, or not sleeping enough\nn F eeling tired all the time or having little energy\nn F eeling guilty, hopeless, or worthless\nn P roblems with concentration, memory, and \ndecision-making\nn Not car ing if you die, thinking about death or \neven trying to commit suicide\nTreatment\nTake a look at her daily life  .

R egular exercise and getting daily sunlight \nwhenever possible\nYou may need some medical attention, including \nmedication, along with professional mental health \ncounseling or \u201ctalk\u201d therapy  .\nWhat to Look For\nWe all experience mood changes in our daily lives  .  \nFeelings of sadness and disappointment are normal  .  \nHow can you tell if the client\u2019s depression is serious \nenough to be considered clinical depression?PSY  |  96\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALDepression\nSigns of Depression\nMood Problems\nn F eelings of sadness which remain even when no \nnegative or upsetting experiences have \nn Cr ying for no apparent reason\nn L oss of interest in normal activities that once \nwere enjoyable, such as, sex, social events, family \ngatherings, or hobbies\nn Difficult y doing usual tasks, such as duties at \nwork, housework, or caring for her family\nn F eeling hopeless and helpless; feeling unable to \ncope and no hope that things will be better in the future\nPhysical Problems\nn Distur bances of sleep, appetite, and sexual activity  . \nShe may have trouble sleeping or sleep too much  . \nShe often will lose her appetite or overeat  . \nn Lack of ener gy without doing anything to get \ntired  .  Her speech, thought and movement may \nactually be slowed down  .\nn A gitation  .  The person suffers from unpleasant \nrestlessness or tension  . She may be unable to relax \nor sit still  .  She may feel irritable or short-tempered  . \nn O ther bodily complaints such as backaches, \nheadaches, hyperventilation, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, \nstomach aches, constipation, and heartburn  .\nProblems with Thinking\nn Difficult y concentrating  .  She may be so wrapped \nup in her own thoughts that she has a difficult time paying attention to what is happening \naround her  .\nn F eeling guilty, worthless; exhibiting poor  \nself-esteem\nn S ymptoms of psychosis, most commonly \nhallucinations and delusions  .  Refer to the \nEmotional or Mental Health Concerns Guidelines \nsection for more information  .A person you suspect is clinically depressed should have a thorough medical and psychiatric assessment \nto determine an accurate diagnosis and the best \npossible course of treatment. Based on the woman\u2019s current symptoms and past psychiatric history, she \nmay be prescribed medication. The medical provider or \nlicensed mental health professional and the client will consider the risks and benefits. The possible effects of \ncertain medications on the fetus may be less than the \nrisk of a mother with untreated depression.\nSteps to Take/Screening\nBe understanding and supportive  .  If the client is feeling \ndepressed, she may feel isolated and helpless  . .  Don\u2019t \ntry to talk her out of her feelings of sadness by saying \nthings such as \u201cthings aren\u2019t so bad  .\u201d\nGet a brief history of emotional problems in the client\u2019s family, especially blood relatives such as parents, \ngrandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins  .  This discussion \nmay also give clues as to the client\u2019s cultural beliefs and \npersonal attitudes toward emotional problems  .\nReassure and inform the client that depression can be treated.\nDiscuss her available options. Provide a referral to a \nmental health counselor for evaluation and possible \ntreatment and ensure follow-up  .\nRaise the client\u2019s self-esteem by pointing out what \nhardships she has overcome and her current strengths  . \nShe may be able to draw upon this strength to seek help  .\nHelp identify specific causes of her stress. Help her find possible solutions that would relieve some of the \nstress that may be contributing to her depression  .\nCheck for severe psychological symptoms, such as:\nn Delusions\nn Hallucinations\nn Distur bed thoughts\nn Suicide thoughtsPSY  |  97\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALDepression\nRefer to the Emotional or Mental Health Concerns \nGuidelines  section for more information  .\nPrenatal Depression\nMany pregnant women suffer from the common symptoms of depression, such as fatigue, sleep \nproblems, eating disorders, and lack of sexual interest  . \nThese women may or may not be clinically depressed  .\nWomen who have a personal or family history of depression are more likely to be depressed during \npregnancy  .\nIf the client states that she is feeling depressed, refer her to a licensed mental health professional or to the \nmedical provider for an assessment and intervention  . \nBased on her current symptoms and past psychiatric \nhistory, she may be prescribed medication  . Often a \npregnant woman fears that medication may harm \nher unborn baby  .  The medical provider or a licensed \nmental health professional and the client will consider \nthe risks and benefits  .  The possible effects of certain \ndrugs on the baby may be less than the risk of \nuntreated maternal depression  . Depression may lead \nto poor nutrition, substance use, and suicide risk  .\nStrongly encourage the client to follow through on a referral for mental health assessments and \ncounseling  .\nPostpartum Clinical Depression\nPostpartum clinical depression is more serious, but also less common. About one in every five new \nmothers experience signs of clinical depression  . The \nconsequences of this condition to both mother and \nchild are significant  . Depressed mothers often show \na more negative attitude toward their children, and a depressed new mother puts significant emotional \nburdens on family relationships  .  Solid evidence is \nmounting that maternal depression is harmful to the \nbaby\u2019s development  . In addition, there is a possibility \nof maternal suicide  .The symptoms usually appear between a month after \ndelivery, or as late as one year postpartum  . It is more \ncommon in women who:\nn Ha ve a personal or family history of depression\nn Ar e first-time mothers\nn Ha ve mixed feelings about the pregnancy\nn Ha ve negative feelings about pregnancy \noutcomes such as sex of baby, perinatal loss, or who experienced a difficult delivery\nn Ha ve other psychosocial stresses such as marital, \nfinancial, or housing problems\nMany women may be afraid to tell someone about \ntheir negative or depressive thoughts and feelings  .  \nThey often feel quite guilty since they believe that having a new child is a time when they should feel \nvery happy  .  Postpartum depression is a condition \nthat is very treatable  .  Leaving it untreated can \nsometimes affect the quality of bonding and the \nrelationship between a mother and her child  .\nA woman with serious postpartum depression needs help. Pay attention to suicidal thoughts and \nsymptoms of severe mental illness  .\nAsk permission of the client to contact family and friends to see if they can provide additional social \nsupport  . Refer to a new mothers\u2019 support group  .\nTry to help with the other psychosocial stressors in \nthe new mother\u2019s life, such as lack of resources  .\nBe sure to refer the woman showing signs of depression to the medical provider or licensed \nmental health professional for further assessment and \nintervention  . Based on the woman\u2019s current symptoms \nand past psychiatric history, she may be prescribed \nmedication  . The medical provider and the client will \nconsider the risks and benefits together  .  If the client \nis breastfeeding, the risk of certain medications on \nthe baby may be less than the risk of a mother with \nuntreated depression  . For healthy, full-term babies, the \nPage updated 2019PSY  |  98\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALDepression\nknown benefits of breast milk outweigh the potential \nhazards of most antidepressant medications  .\nStrongly encourage the client to follow through on \na referral for mental health assessment and mental \nhealth counseling  .  She may benefit from counseling \nor short-term medication treatment  . In rare cases, she \nmay need to be hospitalized  .\nPostpartum Psychosis\nThe symptoms usually appear rapidly, one to two \nweeks after delivery or as late as one year after birth  . \nThe client at greatest risk is the person with:\nn A hist ory of bipolar disorder (formerly called \nmanic-depression)\nn P revious postpartum mental health problems, \neither psychosis or clinical depression\nn A family hist ory of postpartum mental health \nproblems\nSome of the symptoms to look for are:\nn R apidly shifting moods\nn M anic symptoms such as extreme agitation, \nrestlessness, and distractibility\nn E uphoria, insomnia, crying spells, and/or extreme \nconfusion\nn S ymptoms of psychosis such as auditory or visual \nhallucinations and delusions  .  See the Emotional \nConcerns or Mental Health Guidelines sections for \nmore information  .\nn Obsessions , which often focus on religious \nthemes or an impulse to hurt or kill the infant\nConsult with your clinical supervisor or the health \ncare provider for an immediate psychiatric referral for \nassessment and treatment  . A client who refuses can \nbe considered a danger to herself or others and held \nfor emergency psychiatric evaluation and treatment  . \nSee the Emotional or Mental Health Concerns \nGuidelines  sections for additional information  .Suicide Risk\nSuicidal clients have reached a state of unbearable \nemotional pain  . \nIt is impossible to absolutely predict who will attempt suicide, but some factors make it more likely:\nn P ast history of suicide attempts, especially if there \nis a history of impulsiveness\nn H istory of suicide by one or more close relatives\nn H igh degrees of stress, particularly stress \nassociated with medical illness or the loss of a loved one\nn S ocial isolation\nn D epression, substance abuse, and schizophrenia\nA client with suicidal thoughts may be at highest risk after the improvement of some of her symptoms, \nbecause it is then that she may have enough energy \nand motivation to carry out a plan  .\nWhat To Do If You Think A Client \nMight Be Suicidal\nIf a client has symptoms of clinical depression:\nListen for indirect statements about wishing to die \nsuch as the client saying:\nn They would be better off without me.\nn I don \u2019t think that I can go on much longer.\nn I wish that I had ne ver been born.\nn I might as w ell give up because I can\u2019t make things \nbetter.\nLook for certain behaviors, such as:\nn Giving a way prized possessions\nn F requent risk-taking behaviors and accidents\nTalking about suicide may be challenging, but respectful \nquestioning does not increase the client\u2019s interest in \nmaking a plan  .PSY  |  99\nSTEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALDepression\nAsk a series of questions to get at her possible \nsuicidal feelings:\nn How bad does it get?\nn D o you sometimes feel like giving up?\nn Hav e you ever thought of ending your life?\nn Hav e you ever thought you might lose control and \nactually hurt yourself?\nn D o you have a plan for how you might kill yourself?\nn D o you have a way of carrying out your plan?\nn Ho w close have you come to killing yourself?\nn D o you feel that you will kill yourself in the near \nfuture?\nn W hat has kept you from killing yourself?\nn D oes anyone know of these feelings?\nIf she denies any suicidal thoughts, express your concern for the client\u2019s sadness and tell her that you \nwant to know if she has any thoughts of hurting \nherself in the future  .\nIf she admits to suicidal thoughts, don\u2019t try to \nhandle the situation on your own.\nLet her know that you care about her safety \nand will need to immediately refer her to your clinical supervisor or a health care provider who \nhas more experience with such situations. Try to \nremain calm and communicate a sense of hope to \nthe client  . If possible, assure her that you will remain \nwith her until she gets the special help she needs  .\nTry not to leave her alone while you consult with your \nsupervisor  .  Have another staff person stay with her  .\nContact your clinical supervisor or the health care provider who will assess her suicide risk and take the \nappropriate actions, according to your on-site, high-\nrisk protocols  .

The pregnancy pushes her \ninto womanhood when she is still in many ways \na child, with many conflicting needs and wants. \nShe will need to care for a dependent infant while still \nhaving needs and interests of other teens her age  .  \nShe may have had little experience in independent \nproblem solving and making important decisions  .  \nShe probably lives and thinks in the present and \noften lacks the ability to plan for the future  .  She is \nprobably greatly influenced by what her friends do \nand say and could be resistant to the advice of adults  .\nSpecial Legal Rights of Minors\nCurrent California law gives some special legal rights \nto children under 18 years of age  .\nConsent to Care \nMinors under the age of 12 may consent to  receive pregnancy, contraception, abortion, \nemergency medical services, and skeletal x-ray to \ndiagnose child abuse or neglect  . In cases of abuse or \nneglect, the provider does not need the minor\u2019s or \nparent\u2019s consent  . In cases of sexual assault services \nand rape, the provider must attempt to contact the \nminor\u2019s parent/guardian, unless the professional \nreasonably believes that the parent/guardian \ncommitted the assault  . \nMinors 12 years of age or older may consent to \nthe services above as well as infectious, contagious \ncommunicable diseases, sexually transmitted disease \ncare, diagnosis, or treatment, AIDS/HIV testing and treatment, mental health treatment, and other \nreproductive health related services  .  The provider \nis not permitted to contact the parent or guardian \nwithout the minor\u2019s consent  . Parents are not responsible for payment if the minor receives services on her own under Medi-Cal\u2019s Sensitive \nServices described below  .

Between ages 12 and 21, Medi-Cal \ncovers sexually transmitted diseases and treatment, drug and alcohol abuse treatment and counseling, \nand outpatient mental health treatment and \ncounseling  .  These services are confidential  .  \nIf a public agency has legal responsibility for a minor, \nthe minor is not eligible for Minor Consent Program \nservices, and the minor must apply for the regular \nMedi-Cal program  . \nMedi-Cal may not contact the parents and the \nparents\u2019 income is not considered in determining \neligibility; only the teen\u2019s own income is counted  .  \nIt is available to young people in all immigration categories, including undocumented; a Social \nSecurity number is not required  .

Tell the support person you\u2019re \nglad they came to the visit, but it is the federal law \n(HIPAA) and clinic practice to interview each client alone \nfor part of each visit  . Then you can ask the teen how she \nwishes to involve family members, her partner, or the \nfather of the baby in her prenatal care  .\nYou may need some extra time to establish a relationship with the teen before the psychosocial \ninterview  .  Give her information about how long the \ninterview will take and the kind of questions you will \nbe asking  .  See the Interviewing Techniques section in \nthe \u201cFirst Steps\u201d chapter  .\nIt is very important to have a nonjudgmental attitude \nwhen working with pregnant teens  .  They \nare often very sensitive to adults\u2019 negative attitudes \nand body language  .\nUnwanted Pregnancy\nGive her a chance to talk about her feelings about \nbeing pregnant  . Spend some time exploring \nwhether the pregnancy was planned or unplanned \nand wanted or unwanted  .  If unwanted, be sure to \nexplore all of her options as outlined in the Unwanted Pregnancy Guidelines\n section  .\nBecause of their emotional and financial dependence on their parents, they are often pressured to do as their \nparents wish  . This may involve making a choice that \nis not truly their own  . If you observe this happening, \nadvocate for the teen\u2019s wishes to be heard  .  You may \nwant to make a referral for family counseling to help the teen and her parents resolve the crisis before a \nfinal decision is made  .The Teen\u2019s Parents\nAsk the teen if her parents are aware of her pregnancy  . \nIf yes, how did they react? Are they supportive? If they do not know, how does she plan to tell them? When? How \ndoes she think they will react? Would she like to practice \nwith you how she would tell her parents?\nThe parents\u2019 reactions may include anger, guilt, sadness, \nor acceptance  .  Usually their reactions will be mixed\nLiving Arrangements\nIf the family is unable to accept the teen\u2019s pregnancy, she \nmay have to live elsewhere  .  Help her explore her options  .\n C an she live with a relative or friend who can provide \nher with physical and emotional support?

They may also \nbe involved in prostitution  . Refer to guidelines in this section for Perinatal Substance Use/Abuse, Emotional or Mental Health Concerns, Depression, and Spousal/\nIntimate Partner Abuse\n, if indicated  .\nIn spite of their high-risk status, some homeless youth \nare reluctant to get services  .\nOthers may want help but are excluded from services \nsuch as battered women\u2019s shelters or residential \nperinatal drug treatment programs because they \nare under 18 years of age  .

Where will she be happiest? \nWhere will her physical and emotional needs as a \npregnant teen best be met?\nAcknowledge that at times it will be difficult to deal \nsuccessfully with both the demands of education and \npregnancy  .  This continues to be true after the baby is \nborn when she will have the challenges of school and \nparenting  .  With the client\u2019s written permission, you might \nwant to communicate with the client\u2019s case manager at \nAFLP so you can support her plans to finish school  .\nSocial Relationships\nPeer groups are important influences for teens  .

The father of the baby may provide \nfinancial and/or emotional support depending on his \ncircumstances and desires  .  The foundation for his \nfuture role as a father is usually laid down during \nthe pregnancy. If he is a positive figure in the client\u2019s \nlife, encourage him to attend prenatal appointments and take part in childbirth preparation classes and \nhospital tours  .Advise her that all unmarried parents will be asked at the time of delivery if they wish to participate in a \nstatewide Paternity Opportunity Program operated by \nthe California Department of Child Support Services  . \nThe program is voluntary and helps establish paternity \nand helps the children gain he same rights and \nprivileges as a child born within marriage, including \nfinancial support and non-custodial benefits, including financial support and access to the non-custodial \nparent\u2019s medical benefits  .

Insulin, a hormone the body \nproduces in the pancreas, helps glucose enter the cells \nto turn the glucose into energy  .  With diabetes, either \nthe body does not make enough insulin or it is not \nable to use the insulin as normal  .  As a result, you may have a problem with high blood sugar  .  Controlling \nblood sugar levels in pregnancy can prevent a difficult \nbirth and help keep your baby healthy  . \nTypes of Diabetes\nThere are different types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, \nprediabetes and gestational diabetes  .\nType 1 diabetes  can occur at any age  .  In type 1 \ndiabetes, a person\u2019s pancreas produces little or no \ninsulin  . People with type 1 diabetes must inject \ninsulin several times every day in order to survive  .\nType 2 diabetes  normally occurs in people over \nage 40, but has been developing as early as early \nchildhood due to the increased weight of the general \npopulation  . Type 2 diabetes runs in families and is less \ncommon among people with a healthy body weight  . \nMany people with type 2 diabetes can control their \nblood sugar with diet and exercise  .  Others may need \noral medications and/or insulin to control blood sugar \nlevels  .  Type 2 diabetes is highest among certain ethnic \ngroups, such as African-American, Native American, \nHispanics, Asian-Americans, and Pacific Islanders  .\nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is diagnosed \nonly during pregnancy  .  In this type of diabetes, the \nwoman\u2019s blood sugar rises because of pregnancy\u2013\nrelated hormonal changes  .  Gestational diabetes \nusually develops during the last half of pregnancy  .  \nIn most cases, blood sugar levels can be controlled \nwith diet and exercise, but some women may need \noral medication or insulin  . African-American, Native \nAmerican/Alaska Native, Hispanics, Asian-Americans, and Pacific Islanders are at higher risk for developing \ngestational diabetes  .\nMost women with GDM return to normal blood \nsugars after delivery  .  If the woman is overweight or \nobese, weight loss Is recommended to prevent or \ndelay the onset of diabetes  .  GDM  |  6\nSTEPS TO TAKEGESTATIONAL DIABETESWhy High Blood Sugar in Pregnancy \nMatters\nWomen with high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) are at \nrisk for:\nn H igh blood pressure\nn C omplications during delivery\nn C esarean section\nn Infections\nn Preeclampsia\nInfants born to women with poor glucose control are at risk for:\nn Lar ge for gestational age (making delivery difficult)\nn L ow blood sugar (hypoglycemia) following birth\nn Shoulder dyst ocia\nn P remature birth\nn J aundice (yellow skin)\nn R espiratory distress syndrome (trouble breathing)\nn M iscarriage or stillbirth (fetal death)\nn B ecoming obese, having diabetes, or heart \nproblems later in life\nChildren of pregnant women with high blood sugar \nare at risk for health issues later in life including:\nn Obesity\nn C ardiovascular disease\nn P oor glucose control\nn T ype 2 diabetes \nWho Provides Care for Gestational \nDiabetes?\nCDAPP Sweet Success Affiliates or specially trained \ndiabetes providers care for women who have diabetes \nduring pregnancy  .

Treatment includes high risk medical \nmanagement as well as education and support in controlling blood sugar, diet, exercise, and psychosocial stress  .  The CDAPP Sweet Success Affiliate team may \ninclude a physician, nurse educator, registered dietitian, and behavioral medicine specialist or clinical social \nworker  .  Some CPSP providers may refer women to an \nendocrinologist or a diabetes center for care if a CDAPP \nSweet Success Affiliate is not available  .\nWomen with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or a prior history of GDM should seek diabetes care before they \nbecome pregnant to achieve control of their blood \nsugar, in order to reduce the risk of birth defects \nand miscarriages  .  Early diagnosis and treatment of \ngestational diabetes reduces the risks of complications \nfor the woman and the infant  .

Milk, breads, fruits, and vegetables all produce \nvarying amounts of sugar in the body  .  These foods \nare needed for good nutrition, but eating too much at one time can raise the client\u2019s blood sugar too \nhigh  . Many women with gestational diabetes can \ncontrol their blood sugar by changing some of the foods they eat, eating small more frequent meals, \ndistributing carbohydrates throughout the day and \nadding physical activity to their daily routine  .\nThere is no \u201cone\u201d meal plan for diabetes  .  A meal plan should be based on the woman\u2019s schedule, food \npreferences, cultural practices, and blood sugar levels  .  \nFor this reason, she should be referred to a registered \ndietitian who specializes in diabetes and pregnancy \nor a diabetes specialist for an individualized meal \nplan  .

For breakfast, it is recommended to:\nn K eep portions small\nn Eat a pr otein food such as cheese, meat, an egg, \nor low-fat cottage cheese with whole grain bread, \ncrackers, or corn tortillas  .  The protein may prevent \nher blood sugar from getting too high  .\nn Not eat fruit, milk , and yogurt or other foods that \ncontain sugars  .

If the client has a blood sugar value of 200 \nmg/dl or greater twice, instruct her to call her CDAPP \nSweet Success Affiliate or diabetes specialist  .\nWhen Insulin or Oral Medications Are \nNecessary\nMany women with GDM can control their blood \nsugar with a meal and exercise plan  . Some women \nmay have to use insulin or oral medications  .  Although \ninsulin is the treatment of choice for pregnant \nwomen with diabetes, new evidence supports \nthe use of some oral diabetes medications in the \nmanagement of gestational diabetes  .  The dosing of \noral medications depends on the woman\u2019s individual \nneeds  .  She will still need to continue following her \nmeal plan, checking her blood sugar, and exercising  .\nInsulin is injected into fatty tissue, usually in the \nabdomen  . The amount of insulin needed is different \nfor every woman  . If the client needs insulin, she will \nbe instructed to give herself one or more shots a day  .  \nHer need for insulin normally increases as she gets \nfurther along in her pregnancy  .\nn Discuss f ears the woman may have regarding the \nuse of insulin or oral diabetes medications\nn I f the woman is not understanding and/or following \nher medication plan, contact the health care providerHandling Stress with Diabetes during \nPregnancy\nA pregnancy complicated by diabetes places \nadditional demands on a woman and her family  .  She \nmay find herself dealing with fears about her own and \nher baby\u2019s health  . The extra medical appointments, \ndietary changes, and blood sugar monitoring may take \ntime away from her work, family, and personal time  . \nIf there are other stresses in her life she may find it \ndifficult to take care of her health  .\nSome women will have difficulty believing that they have \ndiabetes  .  They may ask the same questions over and \nover again as the weeks go on  . It is important to provide \naccurate medical information as well as emotional \nsupport during the pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum  .\nIt is important to find out what the woman is most \nconcerned about and what her fears are  .\nn C omplete a psychosocial assessment and provide \nreferrals or services as indicated\nn A ssess the level of support the woman has to \nhelp her manage having diabetes\nn A ddress common concerns by reviewing the If you \nhave diabetes while you are pregnant: Questions \nyou may have handout with the woman\nn Discuss an y additional concerns the woman may \nhave about diabetes and the adjustments she will need to make\nEffect of Stress on Blood Sugar\nStress can increase blood sugar levels  .

Help the \nwoman decide what may work for her  .GDM  |  10\nSTEPS TO TAKEGESTATIONAL DIABETESOther Psychological Concerns\nIn addition to the normal risks involved with \npregnancy, there are certain psychosocial risks related \nto diabetes  .  Any woman with identified psychosocial \nneeds should be referred for counseling and support from a mental health professional trained in pregnancy \nand diabetes care  .  Pay attention to the following:\nn P revious pregnancy loss: If she has had a previous \npregnancy loss, she may have fears about the health of this baby\nn F amily history of diabetes: If she has friends or \nrelatives who have diabetes, she may have beliefs \nand ideas about diabetes management  . She may \nalso have fears about complications from diabetes  .\nn P revious or current substance use: If she uses or has \nused substances, she may worry that using needles \nwill lead to a relapse  .  She may also be concerned \nabout others having access to the syringes  .\nn Eating disor ders: She may have trouble talking \nabout her eating habits with others  .  Look out for \nover eating, under eating, binging or purging, \nand resistance to talking about her food habits  .  \nRefer clients with possible eating disorders to the \nhealth care provider and registered dietitian  .\nLabor and Delivery\nHow Does Diabetes Affect Labor and \nDelivery?\nIf the woman\u2019s blood sugar has been well controlled \nthroughout her pregnancy, she will likely have a \nnormal delivery  .  The following interventions are \nstandard for all women with diabetes:\nn T he delivery method is based on the size of the \nbaby and how well the baby is doing\nn T he woman\u2019s blood sugar is checked while she is \nin labor and delivery\nn T he baby\u2019s blood sugar is checked after deliveryOngoing Support\nThe task of managing diabetes is difficult and demanding  . \nThe woman will need support and understanding in order \nto follow her meal plan and check her blood sugar daily  .  She \nwill need encouragement, especially toward the end of her \npregnancy when she is tired and ready to deliver her baby  . \nKeeping her blood sugar well controlled during the last few weeks of pregnancy is important for both the mother\u2019s and \nbaby\u2019s health  .\nAddress the items below at each CPSP visit  . If any \nconcerns are identified, refer to the CDAPP Sweet Success Affiliate \nor diabetes specialist  .\nn A ssess the woman\u2019s adjustment to the diabetes \ndiagnosis and the lifestyle changes she has had to make\nn A sk the woman if she is having any difficulties following \nthe meal plan, exercise routine, or blood sugar testing\nn R ecord and plot the woman\u2019s weight gain or loss at \neach visit\nn A t least at each trimester, complete a 24-Hour Dietary \nRecall, and check to see she is gaining appropriate \nweight and has access to healthy food  .

Encourage \nher to breastfeed exclusively for six months and as long as \ndesirable  .  The benefits of breastfeeding are discussed in \nBreastfeeding  in the \u201cNutrition\u201d section  . The breastfeeding \nbenefits of reducing the risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and future diabetes for both the mother and her \nbaby are especially important for a woman with GDM  . \nRefer to a lactation expert as needed  .  See the postpartum \nsection for nutrition guidance for the mother  .\nTesting for Diabetes After Delivery\nIn most cases, following a pregnancy with GDM, blood sugar returns to normal in the weeks after delivery, \nbut up to 25% of women with prior GDM continue to \nhave high blood sugar after their baby is born  . About \n5% will have type 2 diabetes and about 20% will have \npre-diabetes  .  Every woman who has had gestational \ndiabetes should be tested for diabetes postpartum with \nan oral glucose tolerance test  . There is a high chance \nthat a woman who had GDM will have it with the next \npregnancy, so early screening is very important  . The following is recommended for postpartum care for \nwomen with prior GDM:\nn T he woman should see her health care provider \nearly in the postpartum period\nn T he standard for screening women with prior \nGDM is a two hour 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test done before six weeks postpartum\nn T he woman should have her blood sugar tested \nby her health care provider annually\nn S creening for gestational diabetes should occur \nat the first prenatal visit in the next pregnancy\nFor professional materials and more information on \nguidelines for testing blood sugar and treatment \npostpartum see: https://www  . cdph  . ca  . gov/Programs/\nCFH/DMCAH/Pages/CDAPP  . aspx\nPlanning for Future Pregnancies\nEncourage the woman to discuss family planning \nwith her health care provider  .

The information \nincluded in this section is designed to assist in providing the client with basic information on why \nthe tests are ordered and when they are performed, \nas well as a description of the procedure and what \nthe results might indicate  .\nLaboratory Tests\nHemoglobin/Hematocrit\nWhy : This test tells the medical provider if the client \nis anemic, which means she does not have enough \niron in her red blood cells  .  Lack of iron can restrict the \namount of oxygen that gets to her cells  .  Hemoglobin \nor hematocrit is required to determine WIC program \neligibility  .  See Anemia in the Nutrition section for \nadditional information  .\nWhen: Usually at the first prenatal visit and often \nagain at 24-28 weeks  .  Sometimes it is repeated at the \npostpartum visit, especially if the client had heavy blood loss during delivery or during the postpartum \nperiod  .\nProcedure : Blood is drawn from a vein, usually in the arm  . \nResults: Test results of less than 11 gms for hemoglobin or less than 33% for hematocrit may \nindicate anemia; however, variations in these values \ncan also be related to normal pregnancy changes  .  \nClients whose results indicate anemia should be \nencouraged to eat foods high in iron and vitamin C  . \nSee the handouts on Anemia in the Nutrition section \nof this manual  .Rh/ABO factors\nWhy : Everyone has a blood type and a factor, Rh and \nABO being the more commonly identified ones  .  When \na woman who has a negative Rh factor is pregnant with \na baby who has a positive Rh factor, the opposite factors \ncan react to one another and harm the baby  .  The baby \nmay be born severely anemic and, in rare cases, may die  .\nWhen: Blood tests ordered at the first prenatal visit \nwill determine if the client is Rh negative or positive  .  \nIf she is negative, the tests will further determine \nwhether she has already been sensitized  .  If she is not \nsensitized, the test will be repeated at 28 weeks  .\nProcedure : Blood is drawn from a vein, usually in the arm  . \nResults : The test determines sensitivity to Rh  . If the \nclient is Rh negative and remains unsensitized at 28 \nweeks, she will be given Rh Immune Globin (RhIG)  . \nAfter delivery, if the baby\u2019s blood type is Rh positive, she will be given another injection of RhIG or \nRhogam to help prevent sensitivity from developing, \nwhich could impact future pregnancies  .\nUrinalysis\nWhy : Urine may give indications of kidney problems, \ndiabetes or infection, even though the client may not \nbe aware of symptoms  .  All of these conditions can have \nserious consequences for the mother and the baby  .\nWhen: At the first prenatal visit and at each \nsubsequent medical obstetric visit  .\nProcedure: The client is asked to urinate in a specimen \ncontainer  .  If the specimen is to be cultured, she will be \nasked to obtained a \u201cclean catch\u201d specimen (practice \nprotocols should include instructions)  . \nResults: Specimens positive for protein may \nindicate kidney problems or pregnancy-induced \nhypertension; glucose may indicate the client has \ndiabetes; and a positive culture is an indication of \npossible infection  . All of these conditions require \nfurther evaluation by the medical provider  .APP  |  6\nSTEPS TO TAKEAPPENDIXPrenatal Laboratory and Diagnostic T ests\nRubella\nWhy : Rubella, or German measles, is a viral disease that \ncauses a generally mild illness  .  During pregnancy, however, \na Rubella infection, especially in the first trimester, can cause \nserious congenital anomalies in the baby  . \nWhen: The test for Rubella antibodies is usually \nperformed at the first prenatal visit  .\nProcedure : Blood is drawn from a vein, usually in the arm  .\nResults: A person is generally considered immune to \nRubella if their test shows antibodies present at a ratio \ngreater than 1:8  . However, sometimes when a woman \nhas been vaccinated for Rubella her results may show less \nthan 1:8, even though she is immune  .  If the test shows no \nimmunity and the client has not been immunized, she should be offered a Rubella vaccination after delivery that \nwill protect her for future pregnancies  .\nProcedures\nPAP Smear\nWhy : This is a screening test used to determine \nwhether a woman has cancerous or precancerous cells \non her cervix  . The cervix is the part of the uterus (or \nwomb) that is in the upper part of the vagina  .\nWhen: Done as part of the pelvic examination \nconducted at the first obstetric visit  .\nProcedure: The medical provider will use a small implement (wooden, like a small tongue depressor, or \nsometimes a small brush) to scrape a few cells from the \ncervix that are then placed on a small glass slide and \nsent to the laboratory for microscopic evaluation  . The \nprocedure is not painful  .\nResults: Actual wording of the test results may vary from laboratory to laboratory, but generally they give some \nindication whether or not abnormal cells were found  . \nSometimes cells are identified that are abnormal but not \ncancerous  .  These may be related to infections and should \nbe evaluated by the medical provider  .Ultrasound\nWhy : This procedure allows the medical provider \nto check the size and position of the baby and \nthe placenta and to check for multiple babies and \ninternal organs  .  This is helpful in determining if \nthe baby is growing well, whether there might \nbe complications during delivery, and if there are \ncongenital anomalies  .\nWhen: Can be performed at any time during \nthe pregnancy  .  Timing depends on what the \nmedical provider is trying to evaluate  .  Ultrasound \nis not recommended on a routine basis or only to \ndetermine the sex of the baby  .\nProcedure : Ultrasound is not an x-ray  .  The procedure \nuses sound waves to produce a picture of the baby and the contents of the uterus (similar to how a \nsubmarine uses sonar)  . A lubricating gel is placed on \nthe client\u2019s abdomen and a scanner is rubbed over \nthe entire abdomen  . The sound waves are converted \ninto a \u201cpicture\u201d  .  Other specific preparations may be \nnecessary and the client should be referred to the laboratory that will do the ultrasound or check the \npractice procedure manual for those done onsite  .  \nOften the woman will be asked to drink fluids to fill \nher bladder prior to the ultrasound  .\nResults: The results depend on why the test was \nordered  .  Some things it might show are: the baby\u2019s \nsize and development as an indication of when the baby is due, which is important if a cesarean \nsection is possible or to prepare for other pregnancy \ncomplications; determine the baby\u2019s position; see if the baby is growing at an appropriate rate; and to \nguide needle placement in amniocentesis  .\nAmniocentesis\nWhy : The fluid that surrounds the baby in the \nuterus can provide the medical provider important \ninformation about the baby  .  For instance, tests can \ndetermine if a baby has a genetic disorder such as Down\u2019s syndrome or Tay-Sachs disease, a neural tube APP  |  7\nSTEPS TO TAKEAPPENDIXPrenatal Laboratory and Diagnostic T ests\ndefect such as spina bifida (open spine), immature \nlungs (important if preterm labor threatens), and Rh \ndisease in clients who have already been sensitized  .\nWhen: As indicated, usually in the second or third \ntrimester when there is sufficient amniotic fluid  .\nProcedure: An ultrasound is done to show the medical provider where the baby, placenta, cord, and pockets \nof fluid are located  .  A local anesthetic is used on the \nabdomen at the site of insertion and then a very fine needle is inserted through the abdominal wall and \nuterus into the \u201cbag of waters\u201d  .  A very small amount of \nfluid is removed and sent to the laboratory for analysis  . \nThe client may feel some \u201cpressure\u201d as the needle is \ninserted  .  In general, the procedure is not painful  . \nResults: The woman will remain on a maternal/fetal monitor to make certain that the procedure does \nnot start premature contractions  .  Occasionally this \nprocedure can cause the woman to have premature \nlabor  .  The provider may nick the umbilical cord, which \ncan result in an immediate C-section  . Their is a small \nchance of infection from this procedure  .\nScreenings\nSyphilis\nWhy: Untreated maternal syphilis can result in fetal death or can damage the infant\u2019s internal organs and long bones \nin addition to the consequences of untreated infection in \nthe mother and her sexual partners  .\nWhen: A screening for syphilis is required at the first \nprenatal visit  . In California, it is also recommended for all \nwomen in the third trimester  .  Women who are at high risk \nfor sexually transmitted diseases (multiple sexual partners \nduring the pregnancy and/or a partner with multiple \nsexual partners) should have another test at delivery  .\nProcedure: The typical test for syphilis is identified as Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) or as \nrapid plasma reagin (RPR), both of which are tests on \nblood usually drawn from a vein  .Results: Either test will give results that indicate no \ninfection, probable current infection or previously \ntreated infection  . Patients with suspected current \ninfection not only need appropriate treatment but also need to be interviewed for previous sexual contacts \nand need to notify those people regarding their \nneed for testing and possible treatment  . Your local \nHealth Department can assist you with this process  . \nInfants born of women with syphilis infection during \npregnancy will also need to be tested at birth  . For \nadditional information concerning sexually transmitted \ninfections, see the Health Education section on STIs  .\nChlamydia, Herpes, Gonorrhea\nWhy : These three diseases are sexually transmitted \nand each has the potential to harm an infant born \nwhile the mother is actively infected  .\nWhen: In some practices, all women are routinely \nscreened for these infections; in others, they are \nscreened only when the woman is symptomatic \nor gives an at-risk history such as multiple sexual partners or is the partner of someone with multiple \nsexual partners  .  A woman with a herpes infection will \nprobably notice painful blister-like sores in the genital \narea  . Women with chlamydia and/or gonorrhea may \nor may not have a vaginal discharge  .\nProcedure: All of these infections can be diagnosed by examination/culture of the cervical secretions \ntaken during a pelvic examination with a speculum  . \nLaboratories usually provide instructions as to the \nappropriate handling of such specimens  .\nResults: Each test will give an indication of whether a \ncurrent infection is present or not  . Each infection has \nspecific treatment and follow-up procedures that are \nthe responsibility of the medical provider  .  Additionally, \nthese infections are reportable to the local Health Department and also require sexual contact follow-\nup, with which the Health Department can assist  . For \nadditional information concerning sexually transmitted infections see STIs\n under Health Education  .\nPage updated 2019APP  |  8\nSTEPS TO TAKEAPPENDIXPrenatal Laboratory and Diagnostic T ests\nHIV\nWhy : State law requires that all pregnant women be \noffered an HIV test in addition to education about HIV \ninfection and the risks and benefits of testing (See \nHIV in the Health Education section)  . Many women \nwho were later found to be HIV positive did not have \nidentifiable risk factors  .  Thus it is important to talk \nabout HIV testing as an important part of general \npreventative health services in addition to the \nimportance of lowering perinatal transmission  .\nWhen: The test should be offered at the first prenatal visit but can be done at any time during the \npregnancy  .\nProcedure: The most common test for antibodies to HIV (direct testing for HIV virus is not done as a \nscreening procedure) is done on blood drawn from \na vein in the arm  . It is important to remember that \nspecific written consent is required before doing an \nHIV test  .\nResults: Most generally the results will be negative \n(no evidence of infection) or positive (evidence \nof antibodies)  . Occasionally the test results are \n\u201cindeterminate\u201d , which usually indicates that the test needs to be repeated; necessary follow-up for \nthis test result should be decided by the medical \nprovider  .  Positive test results should only be given \nby the medical provider or by a staff person who has \nextensive experience giving HIV positive test results \nand/or crisis intervention skills  .  It is important to \nremember that negative test results may not actually reflect the patient\u2019s HIV status as a person may be \ninfected, and infectious, but not have developed \nsufficient antibodies to result in a \u201cpositive\u201d test  . \nThis situation usually applies to the individual who \nengaged in risk behavior in the three months just \nprior to the test  . Further testing will show more \ndefinitive results  .  Serum Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP)\nWhy : Increased levels of serum alpha Fetoprotein \nhave been associated with a higher risk of having a \nbaby with a neural tube defect (defects of the spinal \ncolumn, anencephaly, spina bifida)  .\nWhen: The test must be done at 16 to 20 weeks of \npregnancy  .\nProcedure: The test is performed on blood taken \nfrom a vein in the arm  .\nResults: Test results are given in a range, with positive \ntests being elevated  .  However, a positive test does \nnot necessarily mean that the baby has a neural tube \ndefect and those tests need to be followed by an \namniocentesis and ultrasound  .  \nDiabetes \u2014 Glucose tolerance test \n(GTT)\nWhy : Diabetic women have three time the potential \nfor giving birth to babies with heart defects  .  They \nare also at risk for large babies and increased fetal \nmortality  .\nWhen: At about 24 weeks of pregnancy, usually \nbetween the 24th and 28th week of gestation  . Some \nwomen may be screened more than once (See the \nGestational Diabetes section of these guidelines)  .\nProcedure: The client will be asked not to eat or \ndrink after midnight the night before the test  . Blood \nwill be drawn for the fasting blood sugar and then \nshe will be asked to drink a very sweet soda-like \nliquid  .  Her blood sugar will be checked one hour later \nto measure the amount of sugar in her blood  .\nResults: The test will show if the woman\u2019s blood \nsugar level is within normal limits  .  If her blood sugar \nlevel is not within normal limits, more tests may be \nrequired  .APP  |  9\nSTEPS TO TAKEAPPENDIXIntroduction to Managed Care\nBackground\nanaged Care is a coordinated approach \nto providing health care services  .  The \ngoal is to provide prompt quality service \nin a cost-effective manner  .  Over the past few years, \nthe State of California has expanded managed care \nwithin the Medi-Cal Program in order to improve \nwomen\u2019s and children\u2019s access to preventive and \nprimary care health services  .\nMany of the most populated counties within \nCalifornia have Medi-Cal managed care systems \nalready in place, and others are in the process of \ndeveloping such systems  .  If you currently see Medi-\nCal patients who are enrolled in a managed care \nsystem, or if you are expecting to see managed care \npatients in your practice, the following information \nmay be useful to you  .\nSteps to Take\nEligibility and Enrollment\nEnrollment in Medi-Cal managed care is required or \nmandatory, for some people, and optional for others  .  \nPeople in the mandatory category include:\nn T hose on CalWORKs\nn M edically Indigent Children\nPeople receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) \nare in the optional group for Medi-Cal managed care  . \nYou may have some patients in your practice who are \non Medi-Cal and never enroll in a managed care plan  . \nContact your local Medi-Cal managed care plan(s) for \nthe specific aid codes that are covered  .  This eligibility \ninformation is subject to change under welfare reform  .\nIn most counties, there is more than one Medi-Cal \nmanaged care plan  . It is important to know which \nplan each of your patients belongs to, so that you \ncan receive the appropriate information to best meet \ntheir needs  .  Your patients may carry cards from their specific plan that will help you to determine their \neligibility and benefits  .  You can also use the patient\u2019s \nBenefits Identification Card (BIC), or the Automated Eligibility Verification System (AEVS) to get eligibility \nand enrollment information  .\nBecause you may have patients from more than one plan in your county, it is important to have \ninformation on all of the plans  .  Try to establish \na contact person at each plan that can give you information on member benefits and provider \nrequirements  .\nDisenrollment\nThere are certain situations in which a member is automatically disenrolled from a Medi-Cal managed \ncare plan  . Some of those are:\nn M ember moves out of the plan\u2019s service area\nn M ember no longer qualifies for Medi-Cal benefits\nn M ember has changed aid codes and now has a \ncode that is not covered by the plan\nn M ember does not keep up with paperwork \nneeded to maintain qualification - may still be eligible, but not qualified\nMembers may also voluntarily disenroll from their \nmanaged care plan and enroll in another plan  . The \nmanaged care plan(s) in your county may have \ndifferent disenrollment procedures  .\nPrimary Care Physician\nIn managed care, the usual way that a member accesses care is through her PCP (Primary Care \nPhysician)  . All members are to receive a physical \nexam when they first enroll with their managed \ncare plan, and regularly thereafter  .  The PCP will then \nmonitor the care of the member on an ongoing basis, to be sure that all of the member\u2019s health care needs \nare being met  . The member should discuss all of her \nhealth-related concerns with her PCP  .APP  |  10\nSTEPS TO TAKEAPPENDIXIntroduction to Managed Care\nThe PCP provides standard care, including:\nn R outine examinations\nn P reventive screenings\nn T reatment of routine injuries and illnesses\nA PCP also coordinates the patient\u2019s care, and offers \nassistance to patients in getting the full benefits of \nthe managed care systems  .  The PCP refers patients to \nspecialty services as needed, and monitors the care \nthat the patient receives from other providers  .\nObstetric care is an exception to this rule  .  In order to \nincrease access to early prenatal services, members \nmay self-refer to OB providers  .  You may provide \nroutine perinatal services to Medi-Cal managed care patients without prior authorization if you are a \nprovider in the patient\u2019s managed care plan  .\nIf the OB doctor is not the member\u2019s PCP , it is important to coordinate with the patient\u2019s PCP so \nthat all care needs are met  . The OB provider must \nrefer the patient back to the PCP for any primary care needs that arise during pregnancy, and at the \nconclusion of perinatal care  .  Prior Authorization is not \nneeded for routine prenatal care services  .OB Services in Managed Care\nManaged care plans follow the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) standards as the \nstandard for services provided to Medi-Cal pregnant \nwomen  .\nIn addition, pregnant members are to receive \nsupport services consistent with the CPSP program \nrequirements  .  These services include but are not \nlimited to initial Health Education, Nutrition, and Psychosocial assessment, trimester reassessments, \npostpartum assessments, care plan development, \nand interventions  .  Each plan may implement these \nrequirements in slightly different ways, so it is \nimportant to contact the Medi-Cal managed care \nplan to determine what their requirements are  .  It is \nalso important to find out if the plan requires use of \nspecific forms and/or written protocols  .APP  |  11\nSTEPS TO TAKEAPPENDIXNutrition T oolsThis page intentionally left blankCDPH 4472 A (12/16)  State of California  - Health and Human Services Agency               California Department of Public Health   \n24-HOUR PERINATAL DIETARY RECALL   \nName:  \nTo be completed by a CPSP Practitioner after asking:  \n\u201cWhat did you eat and drink yester day, starting with w hen you got  up?
