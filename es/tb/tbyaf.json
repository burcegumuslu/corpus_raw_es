By exploring the emergence of activism, changes in corporate practices, and the processes through which pollution comes to matter, this chapter situates recent conflicts over mining within national debates and historical processes. Over La Oroya\u2019s history, toxic emissions have been variously treated as a problem of industrial hygiene and occupational health, and more recently, as an environmental and public health concern affecting local residents, the neighboring valley, and the entire watershed. La Oroya\u2019s notoriety as one of the \u201cworld\u2019s most polluted places\u201d allowed for an expansion of alliances among residents, NGOs, scientists, and activists working to make pollution visible.
