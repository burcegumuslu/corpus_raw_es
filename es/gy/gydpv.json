It also tackles other challenges \nfacing biomedicine today, such as the \nmicrobiome and emerging infectious \ndiseases.\nIrsiCaixa  was created as a private non-\nprofit foundation in 1995 with the \nsupport of \u201cla Caixa\u201d Banking Foundation \nand the Department of Health of the \nGeneralitat of Catalonia. Its director is Dr. \nBonaventura Clotet .\nThe fact that both IrsiCaixa  and the \nFight AIDS Foundation are located in \nthe Germans Trias i Pujol University \nHospital makes for a unique model of \ncollaboration between researchers, \nhealthcare professionals, patients and \ncommunity representatives. This transfer \nof knowledge between the various \nstakeholders with an interest in HIV leads \nto novel solutions that facilitate progress \ntowards eradication of this disease.\nIrsiCaixa  applies a combined approach \nto eradicating AIDS, based on five \nstrategic lines: prevention, eradication \nand functional care; the microbiome; \nnovel treatments and resistance to \nantiretrovirals; immunopathogenesis; \nand other diseases.\nIrsiCaixa  also participates in clinical trials \nto evaluate novel therapeutic strategies \nand actively cooperates with low-income \ncountries in the global fight against the \npandemic. It places special emphasis on \nthe formal training of young scientists, \non innovation and on the transfer of \nknowledge generated in its laboratories. IrsiCaixa  continued, in 2017 , to develop its research agenda aimed at \ncontributing to global efforts to eradicate HIV infection. Aside from the \nimplementation of planned actions aimed at furthering our lines of research, \n2017  was notable for the following: \n\u2014 International alliances of the Microbial Genomics group have been \nstrengthened through collaborations with key international groups and \norganization of The Barcelona Debates on the Human Microbiome 2017 . \n\u2014 PASeq, a web server developed by IrsiCaixa  researchers, was launched \nto facilitate use of next-generation sequencing for viral genotyping and \npolymorphism analyses. Since the beta version was launched, some 3,000 \nsamples from around the world have been sequenced.\n\u2014 New applications have been developed for virus-like particles (VLPs), \ninitially developed as a preventive HIV vaccine strategy. In 2017, applications \nbeyond infectious diseases were explored, such as molecular visualization, \ncancer treatment and animal health, in collaborations with the Barcelona \nSupercomputing Centre, the Vall d\u2019Hebron Oncology Institute and HIPRA. \n\u2014 Eradication studies have been consolidated within the framework of an \nIciStem international consortium (funded by amfAR) project, as evidenced \nby the Dominique Dormont Prize awarded, at the International AIDS Society \nannual conference, to Dr. Salgado  for her research into factors related to \nstem-cell transplantation that could lead to a potential cure for HIV infection.\n\u2014 Progress has been made in developing compounds in spin-offs:\n    \u2022  Aelix Therapeutics SL: first clinical trials using HTI and amplification of \navailable vectors with GMP production of the chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) \nvector. \n     \u2022  AlbaJuna Therapeutics SL: GMP production of immunoglobulins for use \nin clinical studies. \n\u2014 Living Lab for Health has consolidated its participation in new European \nand national initiatives aimed at promoting responsible, participatory and \nopen innovation and research in society.\nIn the immediate future, it will be of crucial importance to be able to access the \nresources necessary to implement a research agenda as ambitious, complex \nand successful as ours. The difficulties in raising funds (fewer calls, smaller \nbudgets and greater competition) cannot be compensated for by increasingly \nsmaller and fewer philanthropic and private sector contributions. To meet this \nchallenge, we need to develop collaborations with IrsiCaixa  in the form of \npublic-private partnerships, so as to raise the funds necessary to maintain our \ncompetitiveness worldwide. \n Letter from the DireCtor\nBonaventura Clotet\nIrsiCaixa Director\nAbout \nirsiCAixAIrsiCaixa 2017 Annual Report  | 4\norgAnizAtionAL  struCture\nBoard\nPresident\nHead of the Generalitat de Catalunya department responsible \nfor health policy \nVice-president\nAppointee of \u201cla Caixa\u201d Banking Foundation\nJosep Vilarasau i Salat\nMembers\nAppointee of the Director of the Catalan Health Service \n(CatSalut) \nAlbert Barber\u00e0 i Lluis\nAppointee of the Generalitat de Catalunya department \nresponsible for research \nIolanda Font de Rubinat GarciaRepresentatives of the Generalitat de Catalunya department \nresponsible for health policy \nAntoni Andreu i P\u00e9riz\nJordi Casabona i Barbar\u00e0\nJoan Guix i Oliver\nManel Puig i Domingo\nRepresentatives of \u201cla Caixa\u201d Banking Foundation\nJaume Gir\u00f3 i Ribas\nJaume Lanaspa i Gatnau\nEsther Planas i Herrera\n\u00c0ngel Font i Vidal\nMarta Casals i Virosque\nRepresentatives of the Fight AIDS Foundation \nMontserrat Pinyol i Pina\nAnna Veiga i Lluch\nSecretary\nMarta Casals i VirosqueIrsiCaixa 2017 Annual Report  | 5\nExecutive Committee\nFor \u201cla Caixa\u201d Banking Foundation\nSra.

This evasive capacity is a major \nobstacle to the design and development \nof new drugs and vaccines. Our challenge \nis to discover mechanisms of viral evasion \nfrom immune response by identifying \nnew viral factors and key immune \nmechanisms.\nOur group has developed three main \nlines of research to date: (1) mechanisms \nof HIV-1 infection immune evasion in \nextreme progression phenotypes; (2) \nidentification of cellular responses \nduring antiretroviral treatment of \nHIV-1 infection; and (3) identification \nof immune mechanisms and their \napplication to the control of persistent \nviral infections and the development of \nnew immunotherapies.\nThe results of these studies are crucial \nfor the development of new therapeutic \nstrategies and drugs aimed at controlling \nand preventing HIV-1 infection. All our \nprojects \u2014 strongly multidisciplinary and \nwith translational potential for clinical \npractice \u2014 tackle the interconnection \nbetween molecular virology and cellular \nimmunology. \n2017 milestones \nMilestones in the past year within \nIrsiCaixa \u2019s strategic lines were as follows:\n\u2014 Immunopathogenesis . Studies of elite \ncontrollers and viremic non-progressors. \nCollaboration with the National AIDS \nNetwork (RIS) in the field of HIV-1 elite \ncontrollers has led to publication of a \nscientific article (Pernas et al, JVI, 2017, \nunder review).\n\u2014 New treatments and resistance \nto antiretrovirals.  Identification of \nnew mechanisms of resistance to \nantiretroviral drugs. This line has given rise to a scientific article (Codo\u00f1er et al, \nSciRep, 2017) and to a presentation at \nthe 15th European Meeting on HIV & \nHepatitis (Rome, Italy). \n\u2014 Prevention, eradication and functional \ncure. This year has seen the continuation \nof two funded projects (PI14/01058 and \nMDS LKR 136618). In vitro models of HIV-\n1 reactivation have been implemented \nto analyse the functionality of CD8+ \nresponse regarding elimination of the \nviral reservoir in the presence of latency-\nreactivating molecules. These studies, \nwhich have attracted the interest of the \ninternational scientific community, have \nresulted in two posters displayed at the \nHIV & Cancer Forum and IAS 2017 (Paris, \nFrance) and at GESIDA (Vigo, Spain). \nOur studies indicate that agents that \nreactivate HIV-1 latency induce specific \nimmune recognition of the reactivated \ncells, but that immune factors are \nessential for effective recognition of \nthe reactivated cells. We are currently \nfinalizing a scientific article and filing \na patent for the method. We are also \nevaluating the role of cellular restriction \nfactors in controlling the viral reservoir \nand their potential as new targets for the \ndevelopment of gene therapy strategies. \nAn additional post-doctoral researcher \nhas been recruited for this area. \nPerspectives for 2018\n\u2014 Establishment and consolidation of \nthe research team and incorporation of \nnew staff. \n\u2014 Continuation with current work in \nterms of advancing research to identify \nnatural infection control mechanisms \nwith a view to developing new \nimmunotherapies and, by improving \ncellular response, advancing research \ninto drugs to control or eliminate the viral \nreservoir.\n\u2014 Expansion of funding at the European \nlevel for our emerging group of young \nresearchers.Graduate theses\nMolecular epidemiology of the \ntransmission of viral variants in \nnew HIV-1 infeccions.\nName: \u00c0uria Eritja Sanjuan\nDegree in Biomedical Sciences, \nUniversity of Lleida (UDL)\nGrade: ExcellentIrsiCaixa 2017 Annual Report  | 14\nmiCrobiAL  genomiCs\nPrincipal investigator\nRoger Paredes\nrparedes@irsicaixa.es\nRoger Paredes is a doctor in Medicine and \nSurgery from the Autonomous University of \nBarcelona (UAB).

Our main areas of research \nare as follows:\n1. Investigating the role of the gut \nmicrobiome in human health and disease\nVia sequencing we study the role played \nby the human gut microbiota in different \nstates of health:  \n\u2014 We analyse the influence of the gut \nmicrobiome in the ability of HIV-1 infected \nindividuals to achieve adequate immune \nreconstitution, control HIV-1 replication \nand limit chronic inflammation. \n\u2014 We characterize co-evolution of the \ngut microbiome and the immune system \nfollowing acute HIV-1 infection. \n\u2014 We study how the human microbiome \nmay affect response to the AIDS vaccine \nand how vaccines and other strategies for \neliminating HIV-1 affect the microbiome. \n2. Developing and evaluating interventions\n\u2014 Improving response to the HIV/AIDS \nvaccine\n\u2014 Mitigating the chronic complications of \nHIV/AIDS infection. \n3. Improving genotypic viral diagnostic \ntools to maximize antiretroviral efficacy\nAs a pioneer in next-generation sequencing \nof HIV-1 in Europe, we lead a number of \nstudies to evaluate the clinical value of \nultrasensitive tests of HIV-1 resistance \nand tropism in response to antiretroviral \ntreatment. \n4. Defining HIV-1 global clinical \nepidemiology\nWe work with leading European \nclinical cohorts (ESAR and EuroSIDA) in \ninvestigations of effects of the virus on \nresponse to treatment, clinical progression \nto AIDS and death.  \n2017 milestones and perspectives for \nthe future\nDuring 2017, our group continued \nto advance knowledge of the causes \nand clinical and health implications of \nresistance to antiretroviral treatments. \nWe also progressed in studies of the microbiome and HIV infection \npathogenesis. \n1. Antiretroviral resistance\n\u2014 Translational research: Two multicentre \nstudies have clarified that the test of HIV-\n1 tropism in PBMCs is useful in guiding \nchanges to treatment for individuals with \nthe suppressed virus. However, this test \ncannot predict who will develop clinical \ncomplications derived from HIV-1 infection \nin the following year.  \n\u2014 Bioinformatics:  We have developed \nPASeq as an open web server \u2014 suitable for \nusers without knowledge of bioinformatics \n\u2014 for automated high-quality analyses \nof HIV sequences obtained using the \nnew mass sequencing methods. This is a \nfundamental step in advancing the fight \nagainst resistant HIV worldwide.  \n\u2014 Public health and policy: As members \nof the WHO HIV Steering Group, we \nparticipated in the launch, in July 2017, \nof three key documents aimed at \nredirecting the global fight against HIV/\nAIDS: HIV Drug Resistance Report 2017, \nGuidelines on the Public Health Response \nto Pretreatment HIV Drug Resistance and \nGlobal Action Plan on HIV Drug Resistance \n2017-2021.\n2. Microbiome \n\u2014 Our group has become a world \nreference for the microbiome and HIV. Our \nfindings that suggest a strong association \nbetween microbiome composition and \nrisk factors for HIV acquisition have \nbeen confirmed by several international \ncohorts. Work is ongoing on deciphering \nthe nature of intestinal dysbiosis in HIV \ninfection using shotgun metagenomics, \nwhich characterizes the microbiome by \nspecies and enables microbial function \nto be determined for individuals with and \nwithout HIV-1.\n\u2014 With support from the Gl\u00f2ria \nSoler Foundation, we are working on \ndeveloping new diagnostic markers of \nchronic inflammation and intestinal \ndysbiosis in HIV-infected persons and on \ndeveloping new probiotic candidates. We \nare investigating interaction between the \nmicrobiome and kick-and-kill strategies \nto eradicate HIV and the impact of \nantiretroviral therapy on the microbiome. \nWe have also begun work, in collaboration \nwith US centres, on animal models of HIV \ninfection.Other participating bodies: \nCenter for Medical Mycology \nand Mycology Reference \nLaboratory (Dermatology) \nat Case Western Reserve \nUniversity and University \nHospitals-Cleveland Medical \nCenterIrsiCaixa 2017 Annual Report  | 16\nhost genetiCs  \nAnD CeLLuLAr  immunity\nNetworks\n- Thematic AIDS Research \nNetworks (ISCIII RETIC RIS \nRD12/0017/0002)\n- Recognized Group SGR2014/211. \nClinical and Basic AIDS Research \nGroup\n- Co-investigator for the FIPSE \ncohort of HIV-positive liver \ntransplants beneficiaries (CB)\nProjects \nRETIRE-HIV.\nFunding body(ies): US NIH/NIAID\n2017- 2021\nResearch supervisor(s): Christian \nBrander\nOther participating bodies: \nUniversity of Miami, University of \nCalifornia at Davis\nRegulation of the immune \nresponse by HIV-specific CD4+ \nT-cells.\nFunding body(ies): Carlos III Health \nInstitute (ISCIII)\n2018 - 2020\nResearch supervisor(s): Alex \nOlvera\nAwards and recognition\nChristian Brander : Organizing \nCommittee of the R4P (Research \nfor Prevention) Programme \n(Madrid 2018)\nChristian Brander : Steering \nCommittee of the HIVACAR project\nChristian Brander: Scientific \nAdvisory Board for the GREAT \nproject \nBeatriz Mothe : Professional \nExcellence Award from the College \nof Physicians of Barcelona \nBeatriz Mothe : Protagonist of the \nJust the Essentials campaign (\u201cla \nCaixa\u201d Banking Foundation) \nGraduate theses\nThe role of HLA-E expression \nprofiles in the in vivo control of HIV.\nAuthor: Clara Duran\nDegree in Biotechnology, \nUniversity of Vic-Central University \nof Catalonia (UVic-UCC)\nTutor(s): C.

These \nstudies include longitudinally followed, \nHIV-infected individuals as well as HIV-\ninfected and uninfected individuals who \nreceive an organ transplant. We also aim \nto identify markers of biological control \nof HIV to improve our understanding of \nHIV immunopathogenesis. Identifying \nimmunological correlates of HIV control \nalso supports our attempts to define \nbiomarkers related to HIV-associated \nneurofunctional impairment. \nOver the last years, our group has \ndeveloped a therapeutic vaccine \nimmunogen that resulted in the creation \nof AELIX Therapeutics as a spin-off in \n2015. The ongoing clinical studies are \ncomplemented by analyses in individuals \nwho have been exposed to HIV but \nremain uninfected. These studies aim \nat deciphering key parameters and \nmechanisms of natural resistance to HIV \nthat could contribute to the development \nof preventive vaccines. \nWe also study possible factors governing \nHCV evolution and immune determinants \nof organ rejection in HIV-infected liver \ntransplant recipients.  These studies \nare also expanded to the clinical setting \nwhere the organ recipient as well as \nthe organ donor are HIV-infected. A \nkidney transplant model is also used \nto determine the effects that ablative \npre-transplant conditioning treatment \nhas on the repertoire of post-transplant \nT-cells and to evaluate how this \nrepertoire contributes to the control \nof opportunistic infections associated \nwith post-transplant lymphoproliferative \ndiseases and other malignant disorders. \n2017 milestones and \nperspectives for the future \nWe have continued to advance the HTI \nT-cell immunogen, now entering the \nclinical trial phase. In these studies, \nHTI is included in different vectors and \ncombinations of vectors, including \nRNA, DNA and MVA. The clinical grade \nproduction of chimpanzee adenovirus \nvector (ChAd) expressing HTI is underway \nas well and will allow us to assess how this vector can boost vaccine responses \neven further.  To date, the ChAd vector, \ntogether with different RNA-based vaccine \nformulations has demonstrated very \nstrong immunogenicity in animal models. \nIn 2017, we completed immunological \nanalyses of a clinical trial conducted \nin Lima, Peru that compared the \nimmunogenicity of a MVA-B vaccine \ndelivered either intramuscularly or via a \ntranscutaneous administration. The data \nwere complemented by transcriptomic \nanalyses and studies of the microbiota \nin faecal and skin samples. The \nPeruvian collaboration has also led to \nthe identification of new HLA class II \nalleles associated with slow HIV disease \nprogression and of the definition of new \nT-cell response targets restricted by \nthese alleles, both potentially helping to \nadvance the development of effective \nHIV vaccines.  As a consequence of these \nstudies, we have been able to successfully \napply for competitive funding (US NIH and \nISCIII) for the 2017-2021 period, which \nwill allow us to further explore T cell \nresponses restricted by HLA class II alleles \nand to study the role of T-cells restricted by \nHLA-E. The assessment of T-cell receptor \nusage by HIV-specific T cell responses \nwere initiated this year in collaboration \nwith the CNAG in Barcelona, employing \nsingle-cell transcriptomic analyses aimed \nat obtaining detailed information on the \nT-cell receptor repertoire in HIV infection. \nThanks to the support by the Gl\u00f2ria \nSoler Foundation, we have essentially \ncompleted the analyses of samples \ncollected in the BCN02 clinical trial. In this \ntrial, early-treated HIV-infected individuals \nreceived a therapeutic vaccination and \na treatment to reactivate the dormant \nvirus and then stopped their antiretroviral \ntreatment. During 2017, when participants \nwere monitored to detect possible viral \nrebound, we observed prolonged control \nof viral replication in 5 of the 14 subjects \nthat stopped treatment. Preliminary \nresults presented at various international \nconferences have been received with \ngreat interest and we are not completing \nthese analyses with additional in vitro \nstudies. \nProgress has also been made in identifying \nplasma factors associated with control of HIV and whose expression is epigenetically \nregulated as a result of HIV infection. The \nIL27 cytokine and its specific receptor \nhave been found to be associated with \nviral load and, more importantly, with the \nsize of the HIV viral reservoir. These results \nhave been validated in additional cohorts \nand have been compared with data from \nHIV uninfected individuals, identifying \nIL27 as a possibly important determinant \nof an effective HIV-specific immune \nresponse. On the basis of these findings \nwe are currently evaluating additional \nmarkers for their potential relation with \nin-vivo control of HIV and the pathological \nconsequences of HIV infection (including \nneuro-function). For these studies, our \ngroup works with two local cohorts of HIV-\ninfected individuals and also uses blood \nand spinal fluid samples obtained from a \ncohort in San Francisco. \nDuring 2017, we have also completed \nour study on how in-vitro inhibition \nof O-linked glycosylation affects HIV \nreplication.  Our findings suggest that \nglycosylation is a viral defence mechanism \nthat carries a potentially significant fitness \ncost for the virus. As inhibition of O-linked \nglycosylation greatly enhances viral \nreplication, this strategy has also been \nused to improve viral outgrowth kinetics, \nenabling better characterization of the \nreplication component viral reservoir in \nHIV-infected individuals. \nContinuing work in liver transplant \nrecipients has enhanced understanding \nof both viral evolution in HCV-infected \nindividuals and the impact of host and \ndonor genetic factors on survival and \norgan rejection. In 2017, the group \nidentified genetic markers in the IL28 \ngenes in patients and donor organs that \nhave an impact on liver fibrosis after \ntransplantation and organ rejection On \nthe basis of these data, we have also been \nable to establish a link between strong \npre-transplant allo-reactivity and organ \nrejection. For the transplantation work, \nwe have also progressed our collaboration \nwith a clinical site in Cape Town in South \nAfrica where the first cohort of HIV-\npositive-to-HIV-positive transplant studies \nhad been initiated and which offers a \nunique opportunity to study virological \nand immunological parameters of \nsuccessful transplantation in this context.IrsiCaixa 2017 Annual Report  | 18\nhiV p Athogenesis\nPrincipal investigator\nJos\u00e9 Est\u00e9\njaeste@irsicaixa.es\nDr. Jos\u00e9 Est\u00e9 \u2019s laboratory focuses on the \nstudy of cofactors associated with HIV-1 \ninfection and the relationship with AIDS \npathogenesis.

Identification of new cellular cofactors \nof viral infections\nOur work over the past few years has \nfocused on the study of cell targets \nas an antiviral intervention strategy \nand on validation of these targets in \ncohorts of HIV-positive patients. This \nwork has allowed us to build a portfolio \nof cellular factors at different stages of \ndevelopment, ranging from new target \nidentification/validation and approved \ndrug monitoring to technology transfers \nthrough reports to pharmaceutical \ncompanies or patent registration.\n \n \n2. Study of viral entry and between-cell \ntransfer mechanisms\nHIV needs cell activation and inter- and \nintra-cellular signalling mechanisms \nto ensure productive replication and \nthe establishment of chronic infection. \nChemokines and other cytokines induce \nmaturation, survival and proliferation \nof lymphocyte cells targeted by HIV \nand also regulate the expression of \nchemokine receptors (CXCR4 and CCR5), \nwhich act as the main co-receptors of \nHIV entry and the intracellular signalling \nthat leads to virus-induced cell death. \nIn the entry process, and particularly \nin cell-to-cell transmission, different \nreceptors play a key role. Chemokines \nand cytokines modulate expression in \nthe cell surface and activate the cells \nnecessary for viral replication. Our aim \nis to deepen understanding of both the \nmechanisms of interaction between HIV \nand the target cell admitting HIV entry \nand the subsequent viral replication \nprocess.\n3. New antiviral drug development\nWe continue to screen and characterize \nthe antiviral activity of new compounds, \nplacing special emphasis on compounds \nactive against viral strains resistant \nto other drugs and on validating new \ntherapeutic targets based on cell viral \ninfection cofactors.\n4. Coinfection as a model for studying \nthe virus-host relationship\nThe role of mucosal immunology and host genetic factors in susceptibility to \nHPV is poorly understood. Pre-existing \nHPV infection may act as a cofactor for \nHIV-1 transmission and infection through \ncellular and molecular mechanisms that \ngenerate an environment conducive to \ncoinfection. We propose to study the \nexpression of HIV infection cofactors \nmodulated by early infection events or \nHPV reactivation in infected cell models \nand in patients coinfected to varying \ndegrees. Our project results will lay \nthe foundations for new treatment, \nprophylaxis and prevention strategies \nfor sexually transmitted viral infections. \n2017 milestones\nWe plan to continue work underway \nand to improve both the quantity and \nquality of our publications. Significant \nefforts have been invested in applying \nfor and obtaining competitive funding \nto improve the quantity and quality \nof our scientific output and to acquire \nmore staff. Accepted in 2017 was a \nnew Spanish Health Research Fund \n(FIS) project to continue with the \ndevelopment of SAMHD1 as a possible \ntherapeutic marker. Funding was also \ngranted for research staff under the \nStrategic Research and Innovation Plan \nfor Health (PERIS) and by the Agency \nfor Administration of University and \nResearch Grants (AGAUR), to Roger \nBadia and Edurne Garcia-Vidal , \nrespectively. \nThe group now has five projects receiving \nexternal funding. All our researchers are \nfunded or are principal investigators of \nprojects. Dr. Est\u00e9  continues to be an \nexpert advisor to the Research Executive \nAgency of the European Commission \nand Chairperson of the International \nSociety for Antiviral Research. \nPerspectives for 2018\nBasic research is and will continue to \nbe a cornerstone in generating the \nknowledge necessary to discover new \nand effective strategies to cure HIV, \nAIDS and other infectious diseases. Our \ngoal is to continue our research into HIV \ncellular cofactors and restriction factors \nso as to determine mechanisms of action \nand determine their possible role in the \nformation of viral reservoirs in patients. Preliminary results will enable possible \ntherapeutic targets to be identified \nthat will limit or reduce the viral \nreservoir, induce immunity to HIV and \nmaybe even assist in HIV eradication. \nBased on preliminary results, the \ngroup is confident that it will be able \nto contribute to both understanding \nHIV/AIDS immunopathogenesis and \nidentifying new therapy and immune \nreconstitution alternatives.IrsiCaixa 2017 Annual Report  | 20\nretroViroLogy  AnD \nCLiniCAL  stuDies  (greC)\nPrincipal investigator\nJavier Mart\u00ednez-Picado\njmpicado@irsicaixa.es \nEl Dr. Javier Martinez-Picado  is a \nCatalan Institute for Research and \nAdvanced Studies (ICREA) researcher \nat IrsiCaixa  and associate lecturer at \nthe University of Vic-Central University \nof Catalonia (UVic-UCC).

A better understanding of \nHIV and HCV evolutionary dynamics \nwould enable a definition of the factors \nthat contribute to immune evasion, \nimmune persistence and the emergence \nof variants resistant to new antivirals. \nStudies of HIV and HCV variation can \npotentially contribute to the design of \nnew antiviral strategies, bearing in mind \nthe high mutation rates. \nOur group is developing a strategy based \non a new technology called synthetic \nattenuated virus engineering (SAVE), \nwhich recodes and synthesizes parts \nof the viral genome while maintaining \nthe amino-acid sequence present in \nthe wild-type virus and attenuating \nvirulence. This technique has been \nsuccessfully used to develop attenuating \npoliovirus and influenza virus vaccines \n(Martinez et al, Trends in Microbiology, \n2016).\nDeoptimization of different moieties of \nthe HIV-1 gag and pol genes has enabled \nthe development of variants of HIV-1 \nwith attenuated phenotypes in MT-4 \ncells and PBMCs obtained from healthy \ndonors (Martrus et al. Retrovirology \n2013; Nevot et al. 2017). \nThe study of viruses is a pioneering \nendeavour in the new research field \nof synonymous genome recoding and, \ntogether with synthetic biology, is \ngiving rise to interesting basic biology \napplications and the development of \nnovel therapies. Despite great progress \nin research into viral genome recoding \nand attenuation, several questions as yet \nremain unanswered. A priority would \nbe to decipher the mechanism through \nwhich synonymous mutations affect the \nvirus phenotype.\n2017 milestones and perspectives \nfor the future\nOur group is currently studying the \nstability of attenuated viruses and the \npossibility of obtaining a new attenuated \nvirus by deoptimizing other viral genes. \nRecoding has been done by introducing different codon pairs in the gag (1502 \nnucleotides), pol (3011 nucleotides) \nand env (2069 nucleotides) regions \nof HIV-1 (pNL4-3). Only synonymous \nsubstitutions have been introduced. \nThe recoded segments have the same \namino-acid sequence as the wild-type \nvirus but have different arrangements \nof synonymous codon pairs. That these \nviruses have an attenuated phenotype \ndepends, on the one hand, on the \npresence of mutations in certain gag, \npol or env regions that do not allow \nsynonymous nucleotide changes \u2014 \nwhether because they affect the \nsecondary RNA structure or because \nof their effect on the translation of the \ncorresponding messenger \u2014 and on \nthe other hand, on base pair content \n(e.g., the presence of CpG and/or TPA). \nAn important issue is to develop a \nprotocol for culture production of \nHIV-1 infected tissue (MT-4 cells) from \ntransfection of synthetic DNA fragments \n(produced by chemical synthesis or \nPCR) in the absence of infectious virus \nclones. We have produced infectious \nvirus from one or more DNA fragments \n(up to six fragments have been tested) \ncovering the complete HIV-1 genome. \nPreliminary results indicate that the \nstability of the different viral variants is \nassociated with the loss of replicative \ncapacity and, more importantly, with \nthe number of mutations introduced, \nwhich, in turn, determine the \nphenotypic stability of viruses whose \nbiological effectiveness is reduced. \nMassive sequencing of individual \nclones (viral quasispecies) has yielded \ninformation on the sequence space \nexplored by different viral variants.\nAn unexplored aspect of HIV-1 genetic \narchitecture is how choice regarding \nuse of synonymous codons influences \nthe diversity and evolutionary capacity \nof the virus. To be clarified is whether \nthe HIV-1 genome sequences are \noptimized not only in the amino-acid \nsequences but also in the viral RNA \nand proviral DNA sequences. We have \nexplored whether viruses recoded in the \npol region \u2014 with 13% of synonymous \nmutations that alter codon pair usage \nbut not viral replicative capacity \u2014 \nare able to develop genotypic and phenotypic resistance to viral protease \ninhibitors in a similar way to wild-type \nviruses. Our results show that viruses \nrecoded in the pol region show a pattern \nof resistance to protease inhibitors that \nis different from that of the wild-type \nvirus (Nevot et al 2017, in press). Our \nresults confirm that the virus recoded \nin their use of codon pairs occupy a \nsequence space that is different from \nthat of the wild-type virus. Note that \neven though the recoded viruses show \ndifferent patterns of resistance, their \nphenotypic resistance is similar to that \nof the wild-type virus, suggesting that \nthe recoded virus is, in mutation terms, \nequally as robust as the wild-type virus. \nThese results have been reported in the \nfirst published study on the evolutionary \ncapacity of an enzyme recoded in its use \nof synonymous codons.\nWe have also explored the impact of the \nuse of synonymous codons in terms of \nan ability to both express the Env viral \nprotein and to replicate the virus. The six \nenv-HIV-1 gene codons AGG, GAG, CCT, \nACT, CTC and GGG were synonymously \nchanged to CGT, GAA, CCG, ACG, TTA \nand GGA, respectively, generating a \nnew Env protein, with results showing \nthat the ability to replicate HIV-1 is \naffected by codon use. Also observed \nwas that mutations in the Env 3 coding \nregion can induce lethality. Ex-vivo \nexpression experiments have shown \nthat Env protein translation is affected. \nOur results underline the importance \nof synonymous substitutions in the \nconfiguration of the viral phenotype. \nWe plan to continue using and deepening \nour knowledge of the SAVE technology. \nWe also plan to study the possible effect \nof bias in the use of codon pairs in HIV-\n1 and HCV translation and evolutionary \ncapacity, as well as the stability of \nrecoded viral variants. These variants \nwill also be used to identify functional \nredundant RNA elements in the coded \nsequences for HIV-1 and HCV. Because \nsynonymous recoding is directed to \na basic function like translation, our \nhypothesis is that bias in the use of \ncodons, codon pairs or dinucleotide \ncomposition potentially has a general \napplication in terms of altering the \nphenotypes of viruses and organisms.IrsiCaixa 2017 Annual Report  | 24\nCeLL ViroLogy  \nAnD immunoLy  (ViC)\nPrincipal investigatorJuli\u00e0 Blanco\njblanco@irsicaixa.es\nDr. Blanco \u2019s group has conducted in-\ndepth studies of the HIV envelope \nprotein and its role in viral transmission \nand CD4 cell death and has also \ndeveloped various tools for analysing \nthe function of this protein both in vitro \nand in vivo.

Her research, initially \nfocused on evaluating the initial stages \nof the viral replication cycle, is currently \naimed at evaluating the pathogenic \neffects of HIV in the lymphoid tissue of \ninfected individuals. In collaboration \nwith the Department of Urology of \nthe Germans Trias i Pujol University \nHospital, Dr. Cabrera has extended her \nresearch to superficial bladder cancer \nand the role played by the immune \nsystem in responding to treatment. She has published some 40 papers in \ninternational scientific journals, has \nparticipated in numerous national and \ninternational conferences, has benefited \nfrom ongoing public and private funding \nfor her research and collaborates with \nseveral national and international groups. \nIn the teaching area, she is a lecturer on \nthe microbiology degree course at the \nAutonomous University of Barcelona \n(UAB) and has been the director of one \ndoctoral thesis and co-director of a \nsecond doctoral thesis. IrsiCaixa 2017 Annual Report  | 27\nPresentation\nThe group focuses its activities on three \nmain research lines:\nHIV pathogenesis in lymphoid tissue\nHIV infection can be viewed as a mucosa-\nassociated disease whose pathogenesis \ndevelops in two phases:  an acute phase, \nassociated with a massive loss of CD4+ \nT-cells resident in the mucosa, especially \nin the gut-associated lymphoid tissue \n(GALT), and a chronic phase, featured \nby gradual destruction of CD4 T-cells \nin peripheral blood, a high degree of \nimmunological activation and massive \nproduction of pro-inflammatory \ncytokines.\nThe mechanisms of destruction of \nCD4 T-cells and the reasons for GALT \nincomplete immune recovery, despite \nantiretroviral treatment and unlike what \nis observed in peripheral blood, is a \ncurrent topic of debate. This difference \nbetween blood and tissue has highlighted \nthe importance of assessing the effect of \nboth the virus and antiretroviral therapy \non lymphoid tissue, as this is where \nlatent viral infection (the viral reservoir) \nis established. Therefore, studies in \nthis area can contribute to achieving \ntotal eradication of the virus. Our group \nevaluates viral pathogenic effects (for HIV \nand SIV) and the impact of antiretroviral \ndrugs on the tissue of HIV-positive \nindividuals with different levels of viral \nand/or immune control as well as in ex \nvivo models of healthy donor tissue.\nFunctional evaluation of the immune \nsystem of individuals with poor immune \nrecovery\nMassive destruction in GALT is one of \nthe possible causes of poor immune \nrecovery after antiretroviral treatment, \nobserved in 15%-30% of people infected \nwith HIV. These immunodiscordant \nresponders present a maturation of the \naltered T-cell compartment and greater \ninflammation and immunosenenesce, \nultimately resulting in higher morbidity \nand mortality. Having collaborated in \nimmunophenotype characterization \nof immunodiscordant individuals, the \ngroup\u2019s current focus is on functional \ncharacterization of the immune system \nof these individuals and on studying the \nrole played by CMV co-infection in their poor immunological recovery and poor \nclinical response.\nUrinary bladder cancer\nBladder cancer is one of the most \nprevalent cancers in the world. Around \n80% of patients present with superficial \nbladder cancer confined to the mucosa. \nThe standard treatment for this cancer \nis the intravesical administration of BCG \n(Mycobacterium bovis  mycobacterium) \nand, although the mechanism of action \nis not fully understood, it is thought \nthat it activates the immune system and \nattracts immune cells to the bladder \nwall. BCG potentially prevents the \nappearance of new tumours but, despite \nits effectiveness, many patients fail to \nrespond and no alternative is as yet \navailable. Our group is working to improve \ncurrent treatment by developing new \ntherapeutic strategies and identifying \nbiomarkers that would predict response \nto treatments.\n2017 milestones and perspectives \nfor the future \nIn 2017, the results obtained in different \nlines of work were as follows:\nHIV pathogenesis in lymphoid tissue \n\u2014 Determination of autophagy in tonsil \ncells using different techniques. This has \nenabled us to evaluate the changes that \noccur in autophagy after HIV infection. \n\u2014 Demonstration that, in lymphoid \ntissue, cell death is a complex process \nthat implies both non-inflammatory \ndeath (apoptosis and autophagy) and \ninflammatory death (pyroptosis).\n\u2014 Description of the effects of cell \ndeath inhibition on HIV pathogenesis. \nEvaluation of the effects of different \ndrugs modulating autophagy, apoptosis \nand pyroptosis in infection will allow us \nto determine if these processes could be \nnew therapeutic targets.\nImmunodiscordant responders\n\u2014 Determination of the effect of the \nhumoral immune response against CMV \nin immune recovery. Immunodiscordant \nindividuals present higher levels of IgG \nantibodies against CMV in plasma than \nindividuals with adequate immune \nrecovery. This increase in IgG levels is \nthe result of a greater number of CMV \nreactivations, which suggests that co-infection with CMV is an important factor \nin high mortality/morbidity rates for \nthese patients.\n\u2014 Determination of cellular immune \nsystem functionality and characterization \nof the specific cellular response. Despite \nhaving a phenotypically very altered \nT-cell compartment, immunodiscordant \nindividuals preserve their polyclonal \nand HIV-specific responses. In contrast, \nspecific responses to CMV are much \nhigher in immunodiscordant patients \nthan in immunoconcordant or HIV-\nnegative individuals. This reinforces the \nidea that co-infection with CMV plays a \nsignificant role in the inadequate immune \nrecovery of these individuals.\n\u2014 Determination of the role played \nby autophagy in immune recovery. \nT-cell autophagic response is reduced \nin immunodiscordant patients. \nCharacterization of the autophagy \nprocess in other patient cohorts would \nimprove understanding of the role played \nby this process in the immune recovery \nof HIV-infected individuals. \nBladder cancer\n\u2014 Therapeutic strategies for improving \ntreatment with BCG. A phase I clinical trial \nhas been launched to study the possibility \nof strengthening the immune system of \nindividuals with superficial bladder cancer \nbefore they receive intravesical BCG, \nso as to improve clinical efficacy of the \ntreatment. \n\u2014 Study of treatment response \nbiomarkers. A cohort of individuals with \nsuperficial bladder cancer has been \nestablished in order to study possible \nblood, urine and tissue biomarkers of \nresponse to treatment.Mem\u00f2ria IrsiCaixa 2015  | 28\nMem\u00f2ria IrsiCaixa 2015  | 29\nreseArCh  mAnAgementIrsiCaixa 2017 Annual Report  | 30\nsCientifiC  AnD\nteChniCAL  serViCes\nCoordinatorLidia Ruiz\nSample Conservation \nand Processing Service\nEul\u00e0lia Grau\nRafi Ayen\nLuc\u00eda G\u00f3mez\nSequencing Service\nTeresa Puig\nCristina Ram\u00edrez\nAssistant\nSusana EstebanSample Conservation \nand Processing Service\nThe IrsiCaixa  Retrovirology Laboratory, \nwhich began operations in 1993, \nprocesses and preserves biological \nsamples from HIV-infected patients for \nuse in research projects.\nOver the years, the laboratory has \nprocessed and conserved samples for \nnumerous projects and clinical trials \nsponsored by IrsiCaixa  and external \nnational and international sponsors.

The Gl\u00f2ria Soler Foundation , committed \nto encouraging collaboration through \nlines of action based on ongoing dialogue, \nalso looks to the future by building \npioneering experiences in healthcare, \nscientific research and the humanities. \nIn 2016, the Gl\u00f2ria Soler Foundation \nsigned an agreement with IrsiCaixa  to \ndevelop a project aimed at deciphering the \nrelationship between the gut microbiome \nand HIV that has led to significant \ndiscoveries. Thanks to this contribution, \nthe IrsiCaixa  Microbial Genomics group, \nusing shotgun-sequencing techniques, \nhas demonstrated the correlation \nbetween immune deficiency progression \nassociated with HIV and a reduced gene \nand functional diversity of gut microbes. \nThe loss of microbial gene diversity is \ncharacterized by a reduction in methane-\nproducing organisms and an increase in \ngenes that detoxify endogenous toxic \nreagents derived from oxygen (ROS) and \nnitrogen (RNS). \nPresentation of these results at \ninternational conferences has led to \ncollaborations with groups with a long \nhistory and track record in this field. \nShort-chain fatty acid (acetate, butyrate, \npropionate, valerate, isobutyrate, and \nisovaleric) content in faecal samples \nhave been estimated and analysed in \ncollaboration with the group led by \nNichole Klatt, principal investigator of \nthe Center for Innate Immunity and \nImmune Disease at the University of \nWashington. \nEarly results show that individuals with \na less diverse gene pool have higher \nlevels of butyrate, a metabolite essential to the growth of the cells that form the \nintestinal epithelium. \nFaecal metabolome was analysed on a \nlarge scale in collaboration with Rovira \ni Virgili University (Tarragona). Gas \nchromatography and mass spectrometry \nwere used to characterize the metabolic \nprofile of the 156 faecal samples \ncollected for the project. At present, \naround 300 metabolites of microbial \norigin per sample have been identified. \nThese results are being analysed as we \nacquire the necessary knowledge to \ncorrectly interpret them.\nA longitudinal study of gut flora was \nlaunched to run parallel to the HIV-1 \ntherapeutic vaccine clinical trial led by \nChristian Brander \u2018s group at IrsiCaixa . A \ntotal of 85 faecal samples are available, \nprovided by 12 individuals who \nparticipated in the BCN02-ROMI trial, \nwhich has also received funding from \nthe Gl\u00f2ria Soler Foundation . Analysis \nof the corresponding sequencing data, \nwhich will begin shortly, aims to identify \nmicrobial changes in the guts of these \npatients during immune response \nactivation at different stages of the \nclinical trial.\nFinally, collaboration has begun with \nDr. Jason M. Brenchley, leader of the \nparasitic disease group at the US NIH, a \nworldwide reference for the microbiome \nand HIV. The aim of this project is to \ncharacterize faecal microbes in macaque \nmonkeys before and after exposure \nto SIV, related to HIV and the cause of \nAIDS in simians. These samples will be \nshotgun-sequenced in the first quarter \nof 2018.IrsiCaixa 2017 Annual Report  | 36\ntrAining\nIrsiCaixa  has been committed from the \noutset to training young researchers \nand developing successful careers in the \nbiomedical research area.

This  is the first evidence \nthat the microbiota can influence HIV-\n1 transmission.  The study launches an \narea for research into the role played by \nmicrobes in the drug metabolism that \nwill acquire great importance in the \ncoming years.\nDr. Fern\u00e1ndez-Real from the University \nof Girona presented results of recent \nwork demonstrating that one effect of \nmetformin \u2014 the drug most commonly \nused to treat adult diabetes \u2014 is to \nmodify the gut microbiota so as to favour \nbacteria more capable of metabolizing \nsugars in the diet.\nThe IrsiCaixa  Microbial Genomics group \npresented data demonstrating that the \ngut microbiome in people with HIV-1 is \nmodified to adapt to the oxidative stress \ncaused by the infection.  This adaptation \nleads to an increase in bacteria more \ncapable of tolerating oxygen and \nnitrogen free radicals. Adaptation to \noxidative stress, which is much more \nevident in people with a significantly \nimpaired immune system, favours \nincreases in certain bacterial virulence \nfactors and brings about changes in an \nindividual\u2019s antibiotic resistance profile. \nAn interesting observation is that the \npatterns of change observed in HIV \ninfection are similar to those of other \ndiseases where there is inflammation of \nthe gut. \nMicrobiota and cancer\nLaurence Zitvogel from INSERM \npresented data showing that \ncertain gut microbiota bacteria can \nstimulate the response to the new immunomodulatory drugs used to \ntreat certain types of cancer. He also \nsuggested that antibiotic treatment \ncould alter the response to some of \nthese new immunomodulatory drugs \nand so affect patient survival.Jordi Cabanas | BIOCAT\nJordi Cabanas | BIOCAT\nThese and other issues related to the \nrole played by the microbiota in healthy \nageing, neurodegenerative diseases \n(such as Parkinson), inflammatory \nbowel disease and other human health \nareas were the focal points of an event \nthat annually brings together some 200 \npeople interested in the science of the \nmicrobiome and its translation to the \nmedicine of the 21st century.Mem\u00f2ria IrsiCaixa 2015  | 43\npubLiCAtions  AnD presentAtionsIrsiCaixa 2017 Annual Report  | 44\npubLiCAtions\nOriginal publications\n1.
