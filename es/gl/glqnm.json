We deliver emergency aid to people affected by armed conflict, epidemics, natural disasters and exclusion from healthcare.   \nThis report is presented along with the financial statements of the \norganisation for the year ended 31 December 2015. These financial statements are a means of transparency and accountability, illustrating the financial situation of the movement as a whole. They have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in Note 1 to the Financial Statements.   \nOBJECTIVES AND POLICIES \nMSF offers humanitarian assistance to people based on need and irrespective of race, religion, gender or political affiliation. We work to save lives, alleviate suffering and restore dignity. Our actions are guided by medical ethics and the principles of neutrality and impartiality. \nIn order to be able to access and assist people in need, our operational \npolicies must be scrupulously independent of governments, as well as religious and economic powers. We conduct our own assessments, manage our projects directly and monitor the impact of our assistance. We do not accept funds from governments or other parties who are directly involved in the conflicts to which MSF is responding. We rely on the generosity of private individuals for the majority of our funding.\nIn 2015, more than 7,700 health professionals, logistics specialists  \nand administrative staff of all nationalities left on field assignments \nto join 30,900 locally hired staff working in medical programmes in nearly 70 countries.  MSF is constantly seeking to improve the quality, relevance and extent of its assistance, and is dedicated to the pursuit of innovation. The Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines supports our field programmes by pushing for improved access to existing medicines, diagnostics and vaccines, and the development of better, more appropriate medicines. MSF also funds research into the development of drugs for neglected diseases.\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nMSF is a non-profit, self-governed organisation. Founded in Paris, France in 1971, MSF today is a worldwide movement of associations, with offices all over the world. Specialised organisations \u2013 called satellites \u2013 are in charge of specific activities such as humanitarian relief supplies, epidemiological and medical research studies, and research on humanitarian and social action. \nIn 2011 MSF\u2019s international governance structure was reformed. MSF \nInternational was registered in Switzerland, and in December 2011 the first annual MSF International General Assembly (IGA) was held. In subsequent years, the IGA will be held in June. The IGA comprises two representatives of each MSF association, two representatives elected by the individual members of MSF International, and the International President. The IGA is the highest authority of MSF International and is responsible for safeguarding MSF\u2019s medical humanitarian mission, and providing strategic orientation to all MSF entities. \nThe International Board acts on behalf of and is accountable to the IGA.  \nIt is made up of representatives of MSF\u2019s operational directorates as \nwell as a group elected by the IGA, and is chaired by the International President. The International Board prepares and presents the international combined Financial Statements to the OGA for approval.For the year ended 31 December 2015\nTHE CHARTER OF M\u00c9DECINS SANS FRONTI\u00c8RES\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res is a private international association. The association is made up mainly \nof doctors and health sector workers and is also open to all other professions that might help in achieving its aims. All of its members agree to honour the following principles: \n\u2013   M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res provides assistance \nto populations in distress, to victims of natural or man-made disasters and to victims of armed conflict. They do so irrespective of race, religion, creed or political convictions.\n\u2013   M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res observes neutrality  \nand impartiality in the name of universal medical \nethics and the right to humanitarian assistance and claims full and unhindered freedom in the exercise of its functions.\u2013   Members undertake to respect their professional code of ethics and to maintain complete independence from all political, economic or religious powers.\n\u2013   As volunteers, members understand the risks and dangers of the missions they carry out and make no claim for themselves or their assigns for any form of compensation other than that which the association might be able to afford them.ALL THOSE WORKING WITH MSF AGREE TO ABIDE BY THE PRINCIPLES  \nOF THE CHARTER OF MSF AS FOLLOWS:INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2015PRESIDENT\u2019S REPORT         5THE YEAR IN REVIEW \nIn October, the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) Kunduz trauma centre in \nAfghanistan was targeted by US airstrikes, which resulted in the deaths of 14 staff,  \n24 patients and four caretakers. Over one million people in northeastern Afghanistan remain deprived of high-quality surgical care as a result.  \nOur thoughts go out to the friends and families of those who died. We also \nremember our colleagues who tragically lost their lives this year in a helicopter \ncrash in Nepal and our colleague who was killed in the Central African Republic \n(CAR). We take this opportunity as well to tell Philippe, Richard and Romy, our \nstaff who are still missing in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), that they are not forgotten. \nAttacks on healthcare and the subsequent suffering of civilians\nThe repercussions of attacks on health facilities continue long after the initial \nimpact. The destruction results in thousands of civilians being deprived of essential medical care at a time when they need it most. \nMSF was able to work in Kunduz thanks to negotiated agreements with all parties \nto the conflict that they would respect the neutrality of the medical facility. An \nindependent and impartial inquiry into the facts and circumstances of the attack \nis needed, as we cannot rely only on the US\u2019s own internal military investigations. \nAerial bombardments of hospitals are not new, but neither can they be dismissed as simple \u2018mistakes\u2019. The bombing in Kunduz attracted extensive media coverage \nbecause an international organisation was targeted by the US military. At a time \nwhen attacks on healthcare are intensifying and civilians are paying the price, \nwhat is often an overlooked issue was pushed into the international spotlight. \nIn January, an MSF hospital in South Kordofan, Sudan, was bombed by the \nSudanese Air Force, injuring one patient and one staff member. This same \nhospital had also been bombed in June 2014. Medical facilities were also shelled \nin Ukraine at the beginning of the year, but it is in Syria where we really see medical care becoming the target of both deliberate and indiscriminate violence. \nLaws passed in 2012 effectively criminalised providing medical aid to the \nopposition in Syria. Government forces have since strategically attacked medical \nfacilities and medical personnel, including doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers, \nwith the aim of harming the opposition; an alarming trend of impunity. In 2015, \nthere were 94 aerial and shelling attacks on 63 MSF\u2010supported facilities, causing \nvarying degrees of damage and, in 12 cases, resulting in the total destruction of the facility; 81 MSF\u2010supported medical staff were killed or wounded. Towards \nthe end of the year, medical facilities in Yemen were also bombed. Airstrikes \nin October carried out by the Saudi-led coalition destroyed an MSF-supported \nhospital, leaving over 200,000 people without access to medical care. As a result \nof these repeated attacks on medical facilities, some civilians regard visits to hospitals as riskier than not seeking medical care at all. The \u2018security at all costs\u2019 \nlogic means that humanitarian aid is welcomed when it serves national security \ninterests but is restricted, even attacked, when it does not.  \nPeople on the move\nFleeing violence\nConflict and violence have forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their \nhomes and their countries this year. In early 2015, large numbers of refugees \ncrossed into Tanzania to escape election-related violence in Burundi. By July, \nas many as 3,000 people were arriving in the country each week, and it was estimated that 78,000 Burundians were sheltering in Nyarugusu camp. \nSince the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011, it is estimated that more than \n1.5 million Syrian refugees and Palestinian refugees from Syria have arrived in \nLebanon and the small country is struggling to cope. In Jordan, over 600,000 \nSyrian refugees have been registered to date. \nIn the Lake Chad region in western Africa, 2.5 million people in Cameroon, \nChad, Niger and Nigeria fled their homes following attacks by Boko Haram and sought shelter and protection in refugee or internally displaced person camps. Counter-offensives by armed forces have only added to their suffering. \nMSF works in all the countries mentioned above, for example conducting \nvaccination campaigns in Tanzania, providing free treatment for chronic \ndiseases in Lebanon, running a reconstructive surgery project in Jordan, and \ndespite insecurity, deploying medical teams to the four affected countries in the \nLake Chad region. A large part of the global responsibility for hosting refugees is shouldered by countries immediately bordering conflict zones, a fact that \nrarely makes the headlines.\nThe journey to Europe\nDuring 2015, at least 3,771 people died while attempting the sea crossing to Europe. MSF conducted search and rescue operations at sea and provided \nassistance at Europe\u2019s entry points and along the \u2018migration route\u2019, in a telling \nindictment of Europe\u2019s policies towards the displaced. Due to a lack of safe \nalternatives, people resort to smugglers and risk their lives on dangerous and \nuncertain journeys to escape war and persecution or because they are in search of a better and safer life for themselves and their families. \nThe humanitarian crisis that has unfolded on the borders of the European \nUnion (EU) is largely policy-driven, a result of the EU\u2019s failure to put in place \neffective and humane policies and responses to deal with the unprecedented, \nbut in many ways foreseeable, movement of people. The lack of political \nwill, which became so obvious when dealing with Ebola, was again evident with the \u2018migration crisis\u2019. World leaders turned their backs, hoping that the \nsituation would remain confined to countries far away, despite the fact that in \nsome cases they themselves are contributing to the suffering. Four of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council are involved in bombing Syrian \ncivilians \u2013 Russia, USA, France and Britain. There has been an unacceptable lack \nDr Joanne Liu \nInternational PresidentJ\u00e9r\u00f4me Oberreit Secretary General\nof recognition of the reasons why people are fleeing their countries, and most \nefforts to date have concentrated on deterrence measures aimed at stemming \nthe flow of refugees and migrants arriving on EU soil. \nIt is estimated that one million people fled to Europe in 2015, and that \nalmost 50 per cent of them came from Syria. With no end to the war in \nsight, the numbers will only continue to grow. The EU has externalised the \nmanagement of its borders to Turkey, handing over billions of euros in return for a clampdown on Syrians attempting to make the crossing. The end result of \nborder closures from Europe all the way back to Syria is that civilians are being \ntrapped in one of the most brutal wars of our times.\nOngoing and intensifying violence in South Sudan\nCivilians in South Sudan continue to be exposed to extreme levels of violence. \nIn 2015, rape, abduction and execution were commonplace in some parts of the country, and regional and international attempts to resolve the conflict \nfailed. MSF teams in Unity state witnessed villages being burnt to the ground \nand crops looted and destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people fled into the bush and swamplands, where they had no access to assistance for months at a \ntime. MSF medical facilities were looted or attacked on three separate occasions \nand five South Sudanese former staff members were killed. MSF struggled \nto access vulnerable populations in the worst-affected areas but was able to \ndeliver lifesaving medical care at its projects on the frontlines and through mobile clinics. Compounding the severe humanitarian crisis, South Sudan also \nexperienced the worst outbreak of malaria that MSF has ever witnessed in the \ncountry and its second outbreak of cholera in two years.\nResponse and research and development (R&D) for epidemics\nTowards the end of 2015, the Ebola outbreak was declared over in Sierra Leone \nand Guinea, but new cases have since been reported. The public health systems \nin the affected countries in West Africa have been devastated and routine \nvaccine campaigns, including for measles, tetanus and polio, have fallen by the \nwayside. Reinstating non-Ebola-related healthcare and re-establishing people\u2019s trust in it is crucial to ending the epidemic. However, this is further complicated \nby a lack of trained medical personnel. It is estimated that over 880 medical \nstaff contracted Ebola in the three worst-affected countries, and over 500 died. There are also over 10,000 Ebola survivors, many of whom are still long-term \npatients, presenting with mental health issues, general weakness, headaches, \nmemory loss, muscle pain and eye problems.\nEbola is not the only disease threatening populations, though. Outbreaks of \nmeasles, meningitis and cholera, for example, are common in places where \npeople are forced to live in unsanitary conditions such as refugee camps, or where routine vaccinations have been interrupted. The extremely high \nmortality rates during the recent measles epidemic in Katanga region in DRC \nillustrate how preventive strategies over the past decades have failed. MSF \nvaccinated over 300,000 children between June and September, and treated \n20,000 patients for the disease. In 2015, the MSF Access Campaign launched its \u2018Fair Shot\u2019 campaign in a bid to lower the prices of vaccines, in particular for \npneumococcal disease. There has been a 68-fold increase in the price for the \npackage of childhood vaccines over the last decade.\nMalaria also continues to be a major challenge around the world, despite \nelimination strategies, and there are outbreaks of less common diseases such as \nyellow fever, chikungunya and Lassa fever. In 2015, there was a large outbreak of Zika virus (first identified in humans in 1952) in the Americas, which resulted \nin the World Health Organization declaring it a Public Health Emergency of \nInternational Concern in early 2016. Very few diagnostic tests are currently available, and there is no specific vaccine or treatment. \nR&D must be undertaken with communities and environments in mind to \nensure that diagnostics, vaccines and treatments are effective, accessible and \naffordable, and adapted to the contexts where they are needed most. Ebola exposed a global R&D infrastructure that is unfit for purpose; it cannot help \nsave lives during an emergency. We should be conducting safety studies and \nworking out ethical frameworks during inter-epidemic phases in order to be \nprepared. This would allow fast-track use of experimental drugs and vaccines \nduring an outbreak and efficiency trials as an epidemic peaks. Yet, all too often, \nwe scramble to act only as an epidemic peters out. We must act ahead of \nepidemics, not at the tail end. \nOver the past few years MSF has had to adapt its response to meet the challenges \nof individual contexts, and in Syria in 2015 we continued to run health facilities \nin the country but also offered support, donated medicines and equipment, and set up partnerships with networks of local doctors. Despite difficult conditions \nin CAR, MSF staff continued to address basic and emergency healthcare needs \nacross 13 prefectures and 15 localities by carrying out vaccination campaigns, operating mobile clinics and providing emergency surgery, specialised care for \nvictims of sexual violence and treatment for malnutrition. \nOut of the spotlight, tens of thousands of MSF staff treat patients with HIV \nand tuberculosis, malaria and malnutrition, offer specialist care to mothers \nand children, and conduct vaccination campaigns and surgery in nearly 70 \ncountries around the world. We want to pay tribute to them, and to thank our supporters for making our work possible.  M\u00c9DECINS SANS FRONTI\u00c8RES 6         TREASURER\u2019S REPORTCOMBINED ACCOUNTS 2015\nMSF is pleased to present its audited combined Financial Statements. \nThe combined accounts represent an aggregation of the audited Financial Statements of the 21 main offices worldwide (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States), together with the Financial Statements of the offices in Argentina, the Czech Republic, Republic of Korea, India and Ireland, satellite organisations (MSF Supply, MSF Logistique, Epicentre, Fondation MSF, Etat d\u2019Urgence Production, MSF Assistance, SCI MSF, \nSCI Sabin, Fondation MSF Belgique, \u00c4rzte Ohne Grenzen Foundation \nand MSF Enterprises Limited) and MSF International. The combined Financial Statements provide a view of MSF\u2019s work internationally and are a means of transparency and accountability.\nINCOME\n2015 saw an increase in income for MSF compared with 2014.  \nTotal incoming resources of 1.44 billion euros for 2015 were  \n163 million euros more than in 2014. 2015\u2019s higher income was  \ndue mainly to the increased private income received.  More than  \n5.7 million individual donors and private funders provided 92%  \nof MSF\u2019s income in 2015.\nEXPENDITURE\nTotal expenditure in 2015 was 1.28 billion euros, an increase of  \n217 million euros over 2014. This expenditure can be broken  \ndown into two main categories: social mission and other expenses.  \nThe table below breaks down these categories still further.\nIn millions of e\n2015 2014\nProgrammes 872 699\nHeadquarters programme support 135 114\nT\u00e9moignage / awareness - raising 37 31\nOther humanitarian activities 13 14\nTotal social mission 1,058 858\nFundraising 164 147\nManagement and general  \nadministration \n61 \n60\nTotal other expenses 225 208\nTotal 1,283 1,066In millions of e\n2015 2014\nDemocratic Republic of Congo 100 70\nSouth Sudan 82 83\nCentral African Republic 53 53\nYemen 38 10\nHaiti 32 35\nIraq 31 20\nNiger 28 23\nAfghanistan 27 25\nLebanon 27 16\nEthiopia 27 21\nKenya 22 17\nPakistan 20 18\nChad 20 20\nGuinea 19 19\nSierra Leone 18 26\nSyria 18 17\nNigeria 17 10\nMyanmar 16 14\nMigrant support Balkan route 16 \u2013\nUkraine 16 6\nLiberia 10 23\nOther Countries with spending  \nunder 15 million euros  235 173\nTotal 872 699TREASURER\u2019S REPORT\nThe result of the above is that, in 2015 82% of MSF\u2019s total expenditure was spent on social mission and 18% on other expenses (2014 80% and 20% respectively.)RESULT FOR THE YEAR AND RESERVES POLICY\nThe result for 2015, after adjusting for exchange gains/losses, shows a surplus of 167 million euros (surplus 224 million euros for 2014).  \nMSF has a reserves policy, at an international level, of holding retained earnings to cover working capital needs, buffer, investment, and emergency reserves with a maximum of 12 months of total expenditure. The level of reserves as at 31 December 2015 equates to approximately 10.1 months (9.8 months for 2014) of the year\u2019s activity (see Note 2.14).\nBret EngelkemierInternational TreasurerPROGRAMME EXPENDITURE\nCountries where we ran programmes with spending over 15 million euros in 2015 or 2014 are listed below. \nThose countries listed separately above accounted for 73% of MSF\u2019s \n2015 programme expenditure (2014: 75%).INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2015AUDITORS\u2019 REPORT         7AUDITORS\u2019 REPORT\nReport of the Joint Independent Auditors to the Members of the MSF International General Assembly on the Combined \nFinancial Statements of\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res International, Geneva\nWe have audited the combined financial statements of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res International, on pages 8 to 33, which \ncomprise the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2015, and the statement of financial activities, statement of cash flows and statement of changes in retained earnings and equities for the year then ended, and notes to the combined financial statements. The combined financial statements have been prepared by the International Board of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res International based on the accounting policies set out in the notes to the combined financial statements.\nInternational Board\u2019s Responsibility for the Combined Financial Statements\nThe International Board is responsible for the preparation of these combined financial statements in accordance with the accounting policies set out in Note 1 to the combined financial statements, and for such internal control as the International Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of combined financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nJoint Auditors\u2019 Responsibility\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on these combined financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical \nrequirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined financial \nstatements are free from material misstatement.\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the combined \nfinancial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of \nmaterial misstatement of the combined financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, \nthe auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity\u2019s preparation of the combined financial statements in order to \ndesign audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \neffectiveness of the entity\u2019s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies \nused and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the International Board, as well as evaluating the overall \npresentation of the combined financial statements.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\nOpinion\nIn our opinion, the combined financial statements of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res International for the year ended  \nDecember 31, 2015 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting policies set out in Note 1  \nto the combined financial statements.\nBasis of Accounting\nWithout modifying our opinion, the combined financial statements are prepared in accordance with a special purpose framework as set out in Note 1 to the combined financial statements and, therefore, may not be suitable for another purpose. Our opinion is not qualified in respect of this matter.Ernst & Young SA\n59, route de Chancy\n1213 GenevaKPMG SA\n111, rue de Lyon\n1203 Geneva\nErnst & Young SA KPMG SA\nMark Hawkins \nLicensed Audit ExpertThomas Madoery  \nLicensed Audit ExpertPierre Henri Pingeon\nLicensed Audit ExpertOlivier de Luca  \nLicensed Audit Expert\nGeneva, 19 May 2016\nCOMBINED  \nFINANCIAL \nSTATEMENTS\nfor the year ended 31 December 2015Residents of a displaced people\u2019s camp in Bria, Central African Republic, participate in an MSF measles vaccination campaign.\u00a9 Marta Soszynska/MSFINTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2015COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS         9In thousands of e\nNotes 2015 2014\nIntangible assets 2.1 10,852 8,519\nProperty, plant and equipment 2.2 61,212 58,025\nFinancial assets 2.3 26,843 21,713\nNon-current assets 98,907 88,257\nInventories 2.4 41,200 32,389\nGrants receivable 2.5 20,451 18,018\nContributions receivable 2.6 42,667 28,178\nOther receivables 2.7 14,603 16,680\nOther assets 2.8 15,095 10,925\nCash and cash equivalents 2.9 1,024,744 857,824\nCurrent assets 1,158,761 964,014\nAssets 1,257,668 1,052,271\nPermanently restricted funds 3,257 3,168\nUnrestricted funds 1,031,258 851,649\nCapital for foundations 2,715 1,944\nTranslation reserves 53,507 22,542\nRetained earnings and equities 2.14 1,090,737 879,302\nProvisions 2.10 12,896 9,318\nFinancial debts 2.11 6,615 6,862\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses 2.12 117,162 99,017\nDeferred income 2.13 30,246 56,955\nOverdrafts 13 817\nLiabilities 166,932 172,969\nLiabilities and retained earnings 1,257,668 1,052,271STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITIONM\u00c9DECINS SANS FRONTI\u00c8RES 10       COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSIn thousands of e\nNotes Unrestricted Restricted 2015 2014\nIndividuals 3.1.1 / 4.2.1 1,045,208 78,317 1,123,525 984,783\nPrivate institutions 3.1.1 / 4.2.1 157,296 51,281 208,577 156,910\nPrivate income 1,202,504 129,598 1,332,102 1,141,693\nPublic institutional income 3.1.2 / 4.2.2 1,289 93,345 94,634 114,659\nOther income 3.1.3 / 4.2.1 16,691 390 17,081 23,988\nIncome 1,220,485 223,332 1,443,817 1,280,340\nProgrammes 3.2.2 / 4.2.3 665,451 206,798 872,248 699,074\nHeadquarters programme support 3.2.3 122,706 12,105 134,811 113,921\nT\u00e9moignage / awareness - raising 3.2.4 36,444 800 37,244 31,063\nOther humanitarian activities 3.2.5 13,294 20 13,314 14,088\nSocial mission 837,895 219,723 1,057,618 858,145\nFundraising 3.2.6 162,607 1,205 163,812 147,186\nManagement and general administration 3.2.7 58,901 2,419 61,320 60,204\nExtraordinary expenses 2.2 9 - 9 366\nIncome tax 3.2.8 2 - 2 187\nOther expenses 221,519 3,623 225,142 207,943\nExpenditure 1,059,414 223,346 1,282,760 1,066,088\nNet exchange gains / losses  \nunrealised and realised \n3.2.9 \n5,637 \n56 \n5,694 \n9,654\nSurplus  / deficit 166,708 42 166,750 223,906STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACTIVITIESINTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2015COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       11STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nIn thousands of e\n2015 2014\n1.

To the extent feasible for a  \nnon-profit and non-governmental organisation like MSF, accounting principles are initially based on the IFRS as adopted  \nby the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\nSPECIFIC METHODS USED FOR  \nCOMBINED ACCOUNTS\nEquity accumulation\nSince the first combination of an entity does not result from the purchase of shares, combined equity represents the aggregated equity capital and other equity of the combined entities. Investments between combined entities are eliminated against equity.\nInitial measurement of the combined  \nentities\u2019 assets and liabilities\nSince the first combination of an entity does not result from the \npurchase of shares but from a pooling of economic interests, neither goodwill nor fair value adjustments exist. The assets and liabilities of each combined entity are initially measured at net book value, based  \non MSF accounting policies.\nSubsequent measurement of the combined  \nentities\u2019 assets and liabilities\nAfter the first combination, capital gains or losses, provision allowances \nand reversals contribute to the combined surplus or deficit.   \nThe combined Financial Statements comprise the:\n\u2013  Statement of Financial Position\n\u2013  Statement of Financial Activities\n\u2013  Statement of Cash Flows\n\u2013  Statement of Changes in Retained Earnings and Equities\n\u2013  Notes to the Financial Statements.1.1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe Financial Statements are presented in euros, rounded to the \nnearest thousand. They are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.\nThe Financial Statements have been prepared and presented according \nto the principles of accruals, matching, going concern, consistency and prudence.\nFigures are rounded and therefore may vary slightly from the amounts \npresented in other documents. Rounding differences may exist within summations.\n1.2 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\nThe individual Statements of Financial Position of the combined entities are translated into euros at the year-end rate.\nThe individual Statements of Financial Activities of the combined entities \nare translated at the average rate for the current year.\nThe main currency exchange rates compared to the euro are as follows:\nClosing rate Closing rate Average rate Average rate\n2015 2014 2015 2014\nARS 14.20 10.27 10.26 10.38\nAUD 1.49 1.48 1.48 1.47\nBRL 4.31 3.22 3.70 3.12\nCAD 1.51 1.41 1.42 1.47\nCHF 1.08 1.20 1.07 1.21\nCZK 27.02 27.74 27.28 27.54\nDKK 7.46 7.45 7.46 7.45\nEUR 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00\nGBP 0.73 0.78 0.73 0.81\nHKD 8.44 9.42 8.60 10.30\nINR 72.02 76.72 71.20 81.04\nJPY 131.07 145.23 134.31 140.31\nKRW 1280.78 1324.80 1256.54 1398.14\nNOK 9.60 9.04 8.96 8.35\nSEK 9.19 9.39 9.35 9.10\nUSD 1.09 1.21 1.11 1.33\nZAR 16.95 14.04 14.17 14.40INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2015NOTES  \u2013  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       151.3 CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe 2015 Financial Statements do not contain any changes in \naccounting policies compared with 2014.\n1.4 INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, \nPLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nIntangible assets are recorded at cost (or historical value), net of \naccumulated amortisation and impairment losses. They are amortised  \non a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at their acquisition cost, \nincluding incidental expenses. They are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, using the component approach. Land is not depreciated.\nThe acquisition cost of fixed assets used in the field for programme \npurposes, such as vehicles and medical and communication equipment, is expensed upon shipment to the field, or upon purchase if purchased locally.  When an MSF section leaves a country, the remaining equipment \nis donated to the Ministry of Health of the country or another non-\ngovernmental organisation still present in the country, and thus does not generate any future economic benefit for MSF.\nFinance leases  \nAssets acquired under long-term finance leases are capitalised and \nrecorded in the Statement of Financial Position as tangible fixed  \nassets. They are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the  \nassets. The associated obligations are included in financial debts.\n1.5 FINANCIAL ASSETS\nFinancial assets are stated at fair value. Changes in the value of  \nlong-term investments are recorded in the Statement of Financial Position.  Changes in the value of current investments and other financial assets are recognised in the Statement of Financial Activities.   \n1.6 INVENTORIES\nInventories held at headquarters and by satellites are recorded at the weighted average of the purchase price. All goods and materials present in the field are recognised as expenses when transferred from the headquarters and satellites to the field, or when bought locally.\nAppropriate inventory reserves are recorded based on stock usage, \nexpiry date and any damage.\n1.7 RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS\nGrants receivable correspond to funds owed to MSF by third parties according to a formal agreement. They result from the differences between the cumulative allowable expenses incurred and the funds received for each of these agreements. \nContributions receivable include donations sent by donors before year-\nend for which the corresponding cash has been collected by MSF in the month following year-end. They are accounted for at fair value, at their cost net of impairment. \nLegacies and bequests are accounted for on a cash basis and are \ntherefore not included in receivables.\nOther receivables and other assets are recorded at their fair value.1.8 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nMSF considers short-term deposits, cash at headquarters and cash in the \nfield as cash and cash equivalents. Amounts are valued at fair value with any resulting gains or losses recognised in the Statement of Financial Activities. For the Statement of Cash Flows, overdrafts are included as a negative component of cash equivalents.\n1.9 PROVISIONS \nProvisions are valued at best estimate when MSF has a legal or constructive obligation as the result of a past event, and if it is probable that an outflow of assets will be required to settle the provision.\n1.10 FINANCIAL DEBTS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE \nAND ACCRUED EXPENSES\nFinancial debts are recorded at fair value. Trade accounts payable \nto suppliers are recorded on an invoice basis when the invoices are received by the time of preparation of the financial statements, or valued at best estimate if no invoice is received later. Staff costs and litigation in the field are recorded on the cash basis when there is insufficient information available to evaluate the amount of any financial impact at year-end. Accruals for paid vacation of local field staff have been recorded only by some operational offices as at 31 December 2015, as complete information was not available at year-end. Grants payable and other debts are accounted for at their fair value.\n1.11 DEFERRED INCOME\nDeferred income on public institutional and private grants is recognised on the basis of the difference between the cash received and the cumulative allowable expenses to date for each of the formal agreements concerned. Unspent donor-designated/restricted donations represent contributions received with a specific earmarking that have not been spent at year-end.\n1.12 RETAINED EARNINGS AND EQUITIES\nRetained earnings represent the cumulative surpluses and deficits of current and previous years. They comprise:\n\u2013   Permanently restricted funds, which may be capital funds, where the \nassets are required by the donors to be invested or retained for long term use, rather than expended short term, or which may be the minimum compulsory level of retained earnings to be maintained in some countries.\n\u2013   Unrestricted funds, which are unspent donor non-designated funds to be spent at the discretion of MSF\u2019s trustees to further MSF\u2019s social mission.\n\u2013   Other retained earnings and equities, which represent foundations\u2019 capital, and translation adjustments arising from the translation of entities\u2019 financial statements into euros. Unspent donor-designated/restricted funds are not included as retained earnings, but are treated as deferred income.M\u00c9DECINS SANS FRONTI\u00c8RES 16       NOTES  \u2013  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES1.14 EXPENDITURE\nExpenses are allocated according to the full cost method. The principle \nof the full cost method is to collate under each expense category not only the direct costs that are specifically associated with it (direct allowable costs), but also an apportionment of the indirect costs (overheads). Therefore, all expenditure categories include salaries, direct costs and allocated overheads (e.g. building costs and depreciation).\n1.15 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nForeign currency risk\nSome MSF entities use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange risks arising from significant internal transfers denominated in a different currency to the one in which the expenditure will be incurred.  \nInterest rate risk\nMSF has no significant long-term loans.\nCredit risk\nMSF prioritises the security of its cash and cash equivalents. Investments are generally held in liquid securities, and in banks of high credit rating. The receivables are mostly from governments with high credit rating, where credit risk is low. Other positions are not material, or are covered by provisions. Investments are allowed only in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a high credit rating. At year-end, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. \nLiquidity risk\nDue to the nature of MSF\u2019s funding, together with its reserves policy,  the liquidity risk is insignificant.\n1.16 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nThe nature of pension plans for headquarters and international employees depends on the normal custom for the contracting country of the employee. Pension obligations are usually covered by a defined contribution plan with an independent organisation. Contributions to a defined contribution plan are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Financial Activities in the year in which they are incurred.  1.13 INCOME\nMSF\u2019s income comprises contributions from public generosity and public institutional bodies, as well as revenues from other activities. Private income is donated by individuals and private organisations (companies, trusts and foundations, and other non-profit organisations). Public institutional income represents grants (i.e. contributions based on contracts for specific projects), subsidies and donations received from or pledged directly by public institutional bodies, such as governments or agencies. Income from other activities is mainly from merchandising, equipment and services provided to other organisations, and financial transactions.\nRestrictions\nIncome is considered as restricted only when subject to a donor-imposed restriction. Donors include all the external parties that contribute to MSF\u2019s resources. A donor-imposed restriction is a stipulation and limitation on the use of contributed assets or monetary donations. The restriction can relate to purpose (country, programme or activity), time or other specific wishes (e.g. vaccines). Funds received for \u2018emergencies\u2019 are treated as restricted if the emergency is explicitly specified by the donor or can be inferred from the circumstances, but are otherwise regarded as unrestricted, as the provision of emergency aid embodies MSF\u2019s mission. Donations with donor-imposed restrictions are reported as restricted for their full amount. Unspent restricted donations are carried forward as deferred income. Grants are reported as restricted income for the allowable expenses incurred in the current year.\nDonations\nDonations are based on non-reciprocal transfers of cash or other assets, or cancellation of liabilities. They are recognised as income upon receipt.\nLegacies and bequests\nIf legacies and bequests are restricted by a donor\u2019s will for use by the organisation (sale or distribution forbidden), they are accounted for as restricted income and as assets, classified as appropriate (building, other financial assets, other inventories) at their estimated amount, when accepted by the entity\u2019s Board. If not restricted by donors, legacies and bequests are accounted for when realised in cash.\nGrants\nGrants are recognised as income for the allowable expenses incurred in the current year. At year-end, the difference between the cash received and the cumulative expenses incurred is accounted for as grants receivable or deferred income.\nIn-kind donations and services\nIn-kind donations are not accounted for in the Statement of Financial Activities.

At 31 December 2015, the available portion \n(excluding permanently restricted funds and capital for foundations) represents 10.1 months of activity (2014: 9.8 months). The purpose of maintaining retained earnings is to meet the following needs, as described in MSF reserves policy: \n\u2013  working capital needs, providing liquidity (financing) for the day-to-day functional expenditure, covering the inter-year gap between high income \nat the end of the year and more or less constant funds spent during the year; \n\u2013 buffer reserves for risk coverage, being the risk either operational or non-operational;\u2013  investment reserve to finance future investments, considering both non-current assets financing, and \u2018spent investments\u2019 or extra costs in a given year needed to increase operational or funding capacity; \n\u2013  emergency reserves, when emergency expenditure surpasses amounts foreseen at the budgeting season, increasing thus operational budgets,  \nand these emergencies do not provide at the same time extra-income to be able to carry-out these operations; or\n\u2013 a sudden drop of private and/or public institutional funding that cannot be matched in the short term by a reduction in expenditure.2.13 DEFERRED INCOME (CONTINUED)\nThe breakdown of deferred income by maturity date is as follows:INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2015NOTES  \u2013  STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES       213 NOTES TO THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES\n3.1 INCOME\n3.1.1 PRIVATE INCOME\nIncome from individuals includes:In thousands of e\n2015 2014\nDonations 972,984 857,057\nLegacies and bequests 150,298 127,532\nMembership fees 242 194\nIncome from individuals 1,123,525 984,783\nIn thousands of e\n2015 2014\nCompanies 72,196 62,780\nTrusts and foundations 85,842 58,377\nLottery and special events 45,692 29,498\nJoint appeals 1,751 482\nOther private institutions 3,097 5,774\nIncome from private institutions 208,577 156,910Income from private institutions comes from the following sources:\nIn thousands of e\n2015 2014\nECHO and EU institutions 18,894 38,912\nEU governments 37,077 40,113\nNon-EU European governments 13,962 16,963\nAmerican governments 9,693 8,935\nAsian governments 1,739 \u2013\nOther governments or public institutionss 13,187 9,434\nUN institutions 83 303\nPublic institutional income 94,634 114,6593.1.2 PUBLIC INSTITUTIONAL INCOME\nThe table below presents the breakdown of donations and grants awarded  \nby public institutional bodies classified by geographic origin:\nIn thousands of e\n2015 2014\nInterest / investment income 8 4,257\nMerchandising 575 452\nEquipment and services sold to other organisations 10,580 10,752\nOther revenues 5,917 8,527\nOther income 17,081 23,9883.1.3 OTHER INCOME\n3.1.4 LEGACIES AND BEQUESTS\nThe total value of legacies and bequests expected at year-end but not yet received is 48,820 thousand euros (41,923 thousand for 2014), plus \n23,593 thousand euros pending acceptance (5,446 thousand for 2014).

These grants may cover more than a one-year period and may not \nmatch with the financial year. The following disclosure presents the outstanding amount that MSF has committed to spend according to proposals agreed by the different bodies.\nMSF participated in the establishment of the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) with six other organizations: five \npublic sector institutions \u2013 the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation from Brazil, the Indian Council for Medical Research, the Kenya Medical Research Institute, the Ministry of Health of Malaysia and France\u2019s Pasteur Institute \u2013 and one international research organization, the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), which is a permanent observer to the initiative.\nDNDi became a legal entity in July 2003 and MSF was one of the founding partners. MSF\u2019s objective in its involvement in \nthe creation of DNDi was to help create a reserch and development initiative for neglected diseases, which in time would be self-financing and in a position to work independently of MSF. Accordingly, MSF committed itself to be involved intially for five years. A subsquent period of support was agreed until 2014. In 2013 the IGA decided to continue the support and commitment towards DNDi at the level of 4 million euros per year until 2018.\n5.2 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThere are no subsequent events to report.INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2015NOTES  \u2013  OTHER INFORMATION       312015 2014\nMedical pool 1,787 1,836\nNurse and other paramedical pool 2,469 2,298\nNon-medical pool 3,515 2,952\nInternational departures ( full year ) 7,771 7,086\nFirst-time departures ( full year ) 2,034 1,691\nIn full-time equivalents\n2015 2014\nLocally hired staff 30,988 31,052\nInternational staff 2,924 2,769\nField positions 33,912 33,821\nIn full-time equivalents\n2015 2014\nSocial mission 1,582 1,450\nFundraising 792 650\nManagement and general administration 597 561\nEmployees 2,970 2,661\nSocial mission 60 32\nFundraising 38 31\nManagement and general administration 48 27\nVolunteers 147 905.3.3 POSITIONS AT HEADQUARTERS 5.3.2 POSITIONS IN THE FIELD 5.3 STAFF FIGURES\n5.3.1 INTERNATIONAL DEPARTURES TO THE FIELD\nNote: For volunteers at headquarters, the average number of people is taken into account when full-time equivalents are not available.M\u00c9DECINS SANS FRONTI\u00c8RES 32       NOTES  \u2013  OTHER INFORMATION5.3.4 HEADQUARTERS REMUNERATION POLICIES\nThe gross salaries presented below are based on the policies of the different MSF entities.
